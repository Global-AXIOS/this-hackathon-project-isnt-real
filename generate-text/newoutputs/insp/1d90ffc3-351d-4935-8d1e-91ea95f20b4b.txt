"I've been working on this project since I was a kid. I'm a very tech-savvy person and have been working on projects for a long time. I'm very excited to get this new project to my students so they can't have to be a bit bored and not worry about the future.This application is meant to demonstrate the power of webhooks.This application is made possible by the amazing community of students, especially since I had an early idea of this project.
