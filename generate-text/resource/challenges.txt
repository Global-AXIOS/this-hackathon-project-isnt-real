 Not too many, as the scope of this project was relatively small. It was mainly debugging, and figuring out how to settle ties (which we have to be random) Get data out of Spark AR to control L-ISA Software. Efficiency issues, long runtime  -Inexperience: Going into the project, Ethan had a working knowledge of Godot but no solid conceptual grasp of real-time 3D particle-based fluid simulation. Matt came into the project with neither a working understanding of Godot nor a conceptual grasp of real-time 3D particle-based fluid simulation. While Matt's lack of Godot experience was surmountable in a reasonable amount of time, the collective non-understanding of real-time 3D particle-based fluid simulation was a dealbreaker. Towards the end of the first night of work, we decided to drop the fluid simulation altogether and pivot to experimenting with the Leap Motion tools included in the plugin.   Debugging, keeping track of paths.  Github  Beyond the necessary bug squashing that comes with any code, we had issues arise from using technologies we were unfamiliar with and attempting to link them all together in a cohesive user experience.Had issues directing users from the log in pageHad issues using promises in JSStruggled to properly authenticate with GCP   We tried to use machine learning to analyse the frequencies and train the machine to recognize a chainsaw noise. However, we found this to be more difficult than our skill set allowed, so we shifted gears and manually calibrated the range of the chainsaw decibels.  We were beginners and we did not know how to build a website, yet we overcame the challenge Unfamiliarity with the new concept of app making
