Our future plans for the application include fleshing out the UI/UX design, adding push notifications, and completing the implementations for all the features we are excited about seeing. For example, we currently do not support one user being in multiple houses, but we were careful to structure the database and data access pipeline in such a way as to easily allow this feature to be implemented. Therefore, we believe that this application is very scalable.

This is confirmed by the statistics of the economic affairs sector in the Ministry of Agriculture and the researches of the Agricultural Research Center and the recycling thereof does not exceed only 12 % which lead to serious health and environmental damage. The treatment of agricultural waste is limited to the traditional uses of farmers or is completely eliminated by burning and the result. A black cloud of smoke is not only caused by burning rice straw but caused by other types of waste, which causes an increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide, and therefore a rise in temperature and the consequent change in climate threatens the entire planet with the worst disasters.For Farmers Transformation of Agricultural wastes to composte helping farmers in greening their economy.

Nothing is ever quite perfect on the first try, and that is why I set up a feedback system within the skill. Each day, users can rate the quality of the puzzle. This is stored into my database and I can use it to help me understand what is working and what isn't as I build more puzzles for the future.In addition, I want to iterate on the ISP. I want to find more ways to add value to subscribers with the potential for weekly challenge puzzles, or monthly competitions. I'd love to build out an A/B testing framework for this game so I can truly identify what is working and make smart analytical decisions about where to invest my time next.   Cross-platform with mobile devices This user-onboarding app can be used to create future projects!    Before I begin another title, I want to return to Math Rocket to create a more diverse question set as part of an add-on ISP packages. These will be completely custom created audio and questions and lead to 100 percent variety and add a touch of humour to the game too.

After completion of the website, we will create our offline accessible mobile APP for iOS and Android. Register as a 501c3 Non-Profit Organization to begin contracts and plans with local county, state and federal government.We also plan to form relationships with medical groups and receive funding from government grants and fees so that Res-Q can continue to grow its services and serve the public by connecting evacuees to disaster relief.Give our demo app a try: https://hackathon2019-4636a.firebaseapp.com/#/  testing      Submitted to    Startup Monterey Bay Hackathon    Created by  jon zivku We would like to expand our network to include shelters, food drives, clothing, health services, and legal assistance. We would also like to incorporate features such as curb side service to anyone who would need help transporting themselves to their desired location.  Next, we want to implement the function that allows users to make walking routes that avoid the areas with higher crime rates, taking into consideration the polygon heat map we overlaid. We also want to expand the heat map to show more cities and areas then Salinas, which is the only city we added for our prototype.  Get our current application to connect to a database in the cloud for managing information efficiently.      location service based driving updates based on weather all along the route   Most likely nothing, however maybe we will continue this project in our "free time". The future is limitless. Implementing real-time feedback paired with voice commands to encourage users to fully complete exercises with proper form. Adding a "Buddy System" that pushes notifications to each partner to work out each day and notify each partner about their daily achievements. Creating a positive and active online community. We plan to work on this in our free-time, to make the website much more secure and functional.   I hope to expand the site into a fully integrated site complete with enhanced user experiences and design. I'm also actively pushing myself to create an iOS app for FloodGate, which I hope to push into production soon! Stay tuned for more updates!Made with ❤ in 2019  If both sides are finished, the application could prove extremely useful for residents, especially if the Twilio text messaging service could be implemented for returning updates on the situation without internet access. The first responder software can be used to quickly evaluate the situation of local areas in minutes.  We would like to display satellite images from another API. We would also like to use Google Cloud to integrate large sets of data. We believe it would have the bandwidth and space required to handle the large amounts of data that would be needed in a crisis. We are confident that our idea is strong enough to be distributed in the city, so we will learn how to build the mobile app to make this idea into a reality.

There's a lot more that needs to be completed. The UI requires a lot of work from tapping on an icon on the map to display more information to a detailed profile.    The next steps would be to build out a more comprehensive map view, and a more comprehensive submission view. To further improve the usefulness of the drivability score, our algorithm could utilize machine learning to correlate crash reports with existing weather data to improve the weights of each datapoint.  This would require a subscription to a traffic condition API such as Google Roads API, which we could use to build a dataset for training. A multivariate linear regression can then be trained by gradient descent, minimizing an error term equal to the distance between predicted traffic fatalities and historic trends. The result would be a robust tool for predicting the weather-adjusted risk of driving in a given area.   We will work on making sure the code compiles for NittanyChain, fixing the main Java class to eliminate compiling and runtime errors, and we will fix any issues between the blockchain code and the transaction code that triggers the addition of a new block to the blockchain. We plan on implementing a liking system to the website so that a certain number of likes on a post could send a message to a special user using a Twilio API.   Payment option, offline experience, guidebook for students seeking the first job and polls to help make a tough decision in career choices. Building into a proper application, such as a mobile app. We can use more data sets to make predictions better.  Flushing out the front end  Making it to mobile application (app) or web-based applicationMore features can be added, for example: enlarge our clothes library, activity recommendation.etc. We'd like to enable our app to be used offline to make it more accessible to individuals that lack somewhere to connect to wifi or don't have a data plan. Expanding to android would also make this more accessible because android smartphones are available at a much lower price range than iPhones.Currently our resources are Durham specific - ideally, we'd like to expand to more cities and resources.Adding more sophisticated feature interactions to facilitate an easier experience for the user. For example, if a user were to find a shelter to go to, it would be helpful if Penny could suggest a bus route for the user to take. Expanding the job search interaction also has a lot of potential - for example, the user could communicate to Penny their past work experiences through the chat and she could format it into a resume ready to submit.   We will see! Hopefully the demo goes well, then it will be used for all of my personal projects!!! At Expirology, we're passionate about having as much accessibility within our platform as possible. In the future, we would like to include multilingual support as well as text-to-speech features to improve the outreach of the app and how easy it is for a person of any age or background to use. We would also like to gather a wider database of expiration dates and include dates for products that are not refrigerated since currently we only handle those, simply due to time constraints. We would also like to add features such as text recognition from receipts that could be scanned since this would streamline the process for the user even more!  In the future, we plan to display the MediQR project onto a server and link it with a domain name.

Implementation of natural language processing to improve Google Cloud Vision accuracy. Allow people to create accounts for themselves and include badges, similar to what fitbit has, for attending a certain number of clean-ups, or filling 'x' many bags of trash. We could also use machine learning to try to confirm with the pictures people take that there is a lot of trash in the picture. We hope to expand this extension to have support in browsers such as Firefox as well as additional websites outside of Amazon. We also hope to expand the sources for our database so it can be more comprehensive.  The machine learning model is on the right track but still requires refining. We hope to find better training data to have a model that more accurately reflects the context of the problem. We plan to implement security features like message encryption and user validation. We want to strengthen privacy by giving the user flexibility over which keystrokes are read. Finally, to better serve the needs of users, we want to better integrate psychological services into the experience of the app. If it receives interest it could be built up further and used in a wide array of applications both enterprise and commercial, ranging from disaster relief to allowing people to check their Twitter feed in AR. Next steps include acquiring a larger data set on the a larger variety of companies. Performace enhacement: using a database instead of reading from a csv. More publicity the more people use it the more the economy shifts to a human-centered capitalism model.  We think that the next step after validating the proof of concept is to talk with the CapitalOne team to have access to their production API, so we can test more accurately our platform. In general, we hope this brings awareness to maintaining Earth. We hope to continue working on the application and gain company sponsors. The next step for Helping Hands is to create a fully functioning application that can have a user create an account, upload events and categorize them into different categories. Upon further research and development, there could be a feature that would send alerts or notifications about information about the natural disaster in the user’s area as well as which roads and highways are closed. This app would allow the user to enter their location and it should eventually spread to other cities other than Houston. It will also allow the user to make a difference in their community by helping out in locations nearby to their entered address.
