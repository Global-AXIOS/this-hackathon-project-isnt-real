Ethan noticed that the hardware lab had Leap Motion controllers on tap, and wanted to take advantage of that resource while it was available. While his initial idea, a real time particle-based fluid simulation that could be manipulated using the kit, fell through when we realized that it would take a lot more learning than we could do in a weekend, we still wanted to try out the Leap Motion kit, so we created Digitalis, Latin for "_ having finger-like qualities _", as a way of demoing the interactions possible between the Leap Motion software kit and the Godot game engine tools.   The earth is dying and we as individuals need to be able to make a difference. We need to be responsible for our actions and be the change we want to see. We want to connect all 5 colleges through a funny, light-hearted game.  Our friend is a bio major. test Political polarization is becoming an increasingly significant issue within American society. People are sorting themselves into political echo chambers both on and off the internet. This in turn makes the issue worse, as people fail to ever genuinely interact with those that differ from them ideologically.   Our project aims to end illegal deforestation. In the 26 years between 1990 and 2016, the world lost 1.3 million square kilometers of forest. We have lost 17% of the Amazon rainforest. We are cutting down the lungs of the Earth, limb by limb. While it is difficult to combat deforestation when it is done legally, to clear farmland, or in service of large capitalist enterprises, we can try to stop illegal deforestation. We can surveil the forests and catch deforestation faster. This should make the capture and punishment of the perpetrators easier, which in the long run, should disincentivize the felling of these precious natural resources.  Our ultimate frisbee team needed a new website!  fewafewa   It originally started when we were talking about this recent invention in which developers put sensors in fruits and as people moved their hands in the air above the fruit the program would play a pitch that changed with the movement of the person. From there, we were trying to think of ideas for what to make and after spending some time at the hardware table the idea suddenly popped into our minds.  A lot of adults struggle with persistent feelings of self-doubt, which often stem from experiences in childhood. We also realized the potential of mixed reality to engage with a diverse audience all over the world; however, we also wanted to create something that was accessible. Since many people now have smartphones, we decided to create a therapeutic tool with augmented reality (AR) that is accessible across the world (in contrast to virtual reality that still has a high barrier of entry due to cost).  1 million people use ASL as their main way to communicate, but not everyone understands it. An estimated 1 in 25 adult drivers (aged 18 or older) report having fallen asleep while driving in the previous 30 days. Skin cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the US, and other parts of the world alike, though most cases are preventable. The number of people diagnosed with skin cancer in the last three decades is higher than all previous decades combined, and that number is still increasing. $8.1 million dollars a year goes to skin cancer treatment, with $3.3 million alone attribute to melanoma. The ratio of dermatologists vs patients with skin diseases some of the third world countries is 1:6700. Thus, it becomes challenging for patients to find dermatologists and bear a huge financial burden for themselves, their families and substantial healthcare costs for the nation's economy. Earlier diagnosis can prevent patients from missing the best time of treatments, hence can reduce the costs of treatment and avoid complications. It can also be a powerful tool in helping doctors to make a faster, more reliable and more efficient diagnosis of the diseases. We see great potential in technologies like artificial intelligence with various applications in the healthcare industry, which in turn inspires us to use it for solving skin disease prediction problems, to make this world a better place for everyone. In this hackathon, we have developed ‘DerMax’, a personal skincare assistant.      We wanted to create an rDAI-powered open source support tool that conjured the numinous and encouraged humblebragging. Once upon a time, our team members' roommate significantly inconvenienced said team member and essentially left the team member responsible for cleaning up after him. This team member endured great hardship and after sharing similar experiences with the rest of his soon to be Hackathon team, the idea for House Rules was conceived. Yes As college students, sleep is a major problem. Sometimes we just need someone to tell us when to go to bed. We were inspired by the idea of placing relevant emergency and dangerous event information rapidly in the hands of ordinary people thereby giving them the power to protect and serve themselves and their communities. As a group, we thought of some general categories that we could try and incorporate into our project. We thought of images and games. Many people with disabilities have impaired vision. They have to heavily rely on audiobooks, or braille to go through the day. However, not everything can be easy detected. Thus, this project aids them in reading all kinds of text. The vision is that this technology will be implemented in glasses so that visually impaired people can easily walk outside or do any normal activity without having to worry about anything.   We know how easy it is to get distracted while looking at college websites during the application process, and we want to make college searching more engaging and fun, at least for Mount Holyoke College. By playing this game, people can learn about our college - its traditions, places, values and folklores. Sob story about life   According to research statistics, 80% of students report that they feel stress on a daily basis and 40% of them don’t actively seek help. The response we get when we are seeking emotional support is often “Sorry, I don’t understand.” or “I’m sorry to hear that.” and this hasn’t changed for many years (at least from 2017). Because smartphones and its built-in voice assistant become prevalent these days, we want to create a pocket therapist that offers immediate emotional support whenever and wherever people are.  Five-In-A-Row is a common board game in China and very popular around the world. We all love to play this game, but it is too inconvenient to bring the actual game board and chess pieces with us. Therefore, we want to build a CS program that allows us to play the game on computer, which is much more convenient. Dawn and I did not have 2 more teammates.

While physical art is easier to take ownership of (since, after all, there is usually only one copy of it), digital art loses value very quickly thanks to the ability to have multiple copies.After researching how we can stop digital art theft, I learned that there's a huge intersection between blockchain and art. Integrating blockchain into digital art sales allows creators to create limited, unique copies of their art by assigning a token to each copy. I have no prior experience or much knowledge of blockchain, but I took the opportunity to learn about it by going for the Blockstack challenge.   k In January, 2018, the Board of Trustees set the goal of becoming a carbon-neutral campus by 2037, Mount Holyoke’s bicentennial. So far, the school has done a really good job: reduced electricity use by 16% and thermal energy by 13%. The school has been doing a great job so far, but as members of the community, we wonder: can we contribute to the process as individuals? Thus, our group came up with the idea to develop an App to help the students and faculties to participate in the mission and contribute their own effort.  Tea. In the U.S., 10% of Americans experience hearing loss in various degrees. Consequently, these people depend on ASL (American Sign Language) as their form of communication to the rest of the world. Yet, dependence on a third party for communication poses numerous problems such as potential misinterpretations and the inconvenience of having to run one's messages through another person just to communicate with others.     The world of ERC721 tokens is expanding on a daily basis. Why not give ERC721 owners the opportunity to fight among themselves using their tokens? Crypto Brawl is an answer!     Sometimes a gamer needs to step up his gameplay. When that time comes, Controllaser will be there. This project comes from the curiosity of building something interesting that could be applied to our everyday lives   xxx  text  The inspiration for writing this code was to challenge ourselves using the program of C++.  We develop this project through our very personal experience. We deeply care about our environment. However, when we talk to our friends about the impact of climate change, they just feel like another lecture from Mr. or Ms. Environmentalist. They don't care about the topic because they feel like climate change is a big global issue and they can't do anything to change that. Moreover, many of my friends think climate change is just a scientific myth and they don't see any real impact of it in their daily lives. Therefore, through this Climathon, we get together as a team to develop a game app that can visually show the real impact of climate change and how the players can actually change the effect of it through daily activities. Project Description:My team develop a game called “EcoWarriors” to raise awareness about climate change.  Our goal is to help people change their daily habits and adopt a more sustainable lifestyle. Every action of the users will be tracked and converted to score, that score will be the metrics for the wellbeing of their virtual pet. These actions include: Reducing carbon footprint, Using more renewable energy, wasting Less water, reducing waste ( i.e. Changing to reusable shopping bags), choosing businesses that support green living (partners), recycling, walking instead of drivingGame Storyline:The global climate change becomes a huge problem on Earth and many animals are on the edge of extinction. To prevent the mass extinction from happening, the players will act as a wild-lives rescuers and each of them are assigned with a mysterious egg of an endangered animal. Each animal they are assigned will be the very last one of a species. The players will incubate each egg at the beginning stage of the game. After the players reach a certain score, the egg will reveal their assigned animal ( i.e. penguin, dolphin, whale, polar bear…) Depending on the player’s choice of challenge, a set of tasks will be shown. The tasks are daily action in a person’s life, and every completed task be tracked and converted to score. That score will be the metrics (such as air quality, water quality, energy consumption…) will contribute to the wellbeing of their virtual pet and the improvement of the environment in that animal’s habitat. With higher score level, the virtual animals will slowly bear more eggs and have a family of their own to bring their species out of extinction.  This game raise people’s awareness and educate us about the different sustainable in a friendly and fun way that even a kid can understand. This game is great for individuals or the whole family together. Methods for Score Tracking:Take photos of their electric bills, track decreaseShow receipts of restaurants/businessesTrack geolocation for milage of a person when they are walking or biking.Timing showers and water usageGreen membership card to use on bus or partnered green stores/restaurant/coffee shop/markets. Members with this cards can get discounted at those partnered store, too.Reward for Players:Creating “Badges” for each challenge (i.e. Reducing Plastic Waste)Every month, the community of this game will get together to celebrate the top scored players and listen to their journey of changing their daily habits toward a sustainable living goals. This will help fuel up the motivation of the players and build a stronger community full of exciting environmentally-mindful individual.Data Gathering & Visualization:Summarizing the statistic of average consumption of water and energy on a local-level. Training algorithm with real data to perfect our scoring system. Gathering data about local businesses and markets about their level of green-awareness. Using this data to improve users’ experience and connecting them with the right community partners and organizations which promote the sustainable and green living. Impact of Solutions:This game raise people’s awareness and educate us about the different sustainable in a friendly and fun way that even a kid can understand. This game is great for individuals or the whole family together. Therefore, even the ones who are not so interested in environmental issues before will start to be mindful about it through this game. Our ultimate goal is to raise people’s awareness on the topic of climate change and to motivate community to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle via this gamification project.Future Plan:We are developing the app and working on launching our beta version through limited invitation. Then, when we are confident with our final product, we will launch the official version on the app store and then working on promoting the app through advertising and words-of-mouth. When we have a good initial users base, we will work on building a bigger community. Every month, the community of this game will get together to celebrate the top scored players and listen to their journey of changing their daily habits toward a sustainable living goals. This will help fuel up the motivation of the players and build a stronger community full of exciting environmentally-mindful individual.On the data science side of this project, we will work on:Summarizing the statistic of average consumption of water and energy on a local-level.

I often go to the hypermarket for groceries, I did not like the fact that I lost a lot of time in the queue, therefore I decided to write an algorithm that would optimize cashiers ! :)I understood that there are peak hours when there are a lot of buyers, and there is a time where cashier are sitting idle. I contacted to this hypermarket IT department (one of the largest hypermarkets in our country, more that 80 hypermarkets). After some time, After a while, we agreed and signed documents that I will try to make a better decision. it turned out that before that they already had a similar system, but it did not work)The problemView from the client’s perspective:it takes a lot of time while the client is standing and waiting for his turn at the checkout (~ 15 min on average). There is a high probability of client outflow.View from the business perspective:the company understands that if the number of cashiers is increased, then the customer waiting time will decrease. However, by increasing the number of cashiers the company does not come to satisfactory results; on the contrary, expenses increase due to an increase in payroll.Challenges I ran intoWe agreed that I will complete project in one month, but i spend about 6 month, because project was for real production, and there was many problems that i must to solve.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofI'm glad that with a simple idea, the project turned into a really useful program, here is an example of saving money.N branches x M employees x payroll x 12 months = total payroll expenses• It WAS 40 x 40 x 1000$ x 12 = 19 200 000 dollars per year• It BECAME 40 x 30 x 1000$ x 12 = 14 400 000 dollars per year• Benefit: 720 000 000 (decrease of payroll by ~ 25% )What's next for Cashier optimization system,that reduces client wating time.Built Withforecast.iooptimizationpythonrretai    Created by  Динислам Ораз  A knowledge solution in a fraction of the time. Starting from scratch can be really rewarding. But when you’re implementing a knowledge management solution, it’s probably a good idea to start with one of our frameworks. Browse the library of frameworks to get started.        Edit I've always been interested in building games for voice, as voice is such a different medium than the visual ones we are bombarded with throughout the rest of our day. Voice games are a perfect time to sit back, use your imagination, and really immerse yourself in something, similar to reading a book. It activates your brain in ways you don't get from your phone, your TV, your consoles, or your computer.I've built games for Alexa in the past, but for this competition I wanted to focus on something specific, and that was retention. Generally most voice games don'y have great retention - you play it once, finish the content within a week or so, and you're over it. While that can provide for an engaging experience, it's not always the best path forward for something like ISP. To make some income, you really want people coming back time and time again.Despite the rise of technology in our day to day, and the decline of traditional newspapers, there is still a massive community of crossworld puzzlers around the globe. People still keep their subscriptions solely for the daily crossword. Crossword puzzles and their fun clues are an amazing brainteaser, forcing you to think deeply about words and their meanings, learning and having fun at the same time. Voice seemed like the perfect medium to translate this sort of experience. Voice games are especially great for those "in-between times". It's something you can do when you wake up, when you are doing the dishes, doing the laundry, driving etc. You may be doing something mindless with your hands, but still want to engage with your brain. These were the times of day I wanted to target.With an idea in mind, I set to work!  An estimated 80% of digital camera users suffer from inconveniences with accessing photos from their cameras. The API is so well documented, a developer can only imagine how quick it will be to build with!  As a student, I have hundreds of unorganized documents on my phone and never have time to organize it all. Once I discovered the power of Filestack's API, I knew it was the answer to all of my problems. We wanted to create a developer tool that made it easy for us to utilize images taken straight from the camera.  I wanted to create a fusion of a storyboard adventure with a question & answer quiz format, but with a custom environment that would immerse the user. Math Rocket is my first attempt at creating this format of game and I think it does a good job of taking the player into the unique environment, in this case Space, to wrap around basics of the gameplay.  That's just the idea that came to my mind some time ago when providing db systems tuning at the customers sites. DB Server starts with some parameters set at the installation (like -B, -bibufs etc.) but in the real productive environments they must be set correctly and updated if it is necessary. Some administrators don't realize that and finding bi cluster size 0,5 MB was not a very rare case...The feature could gather necessary information (like OE Management does) and update the parameters, bi cluster size, and much more... It could be a feature  in accordance with 99.99 availability.And it is a very theoretical project, as you may guess.

However, when we start using the PC, it decreases down to 2~5 times per minute. This causes the dry-eye symptom which damages our eyes. In addition, we start to sit on the chair with an unhealthy posture and that causes our face to get too close to the PC screen. When our face and PC screen is too close, there is a possibility of damaging your eyes due to the blue light.  This app was inspired by discussion with real photographers, who are often passionate about taking self portraits. This app overcomes the challenge that comes with taking a photo where the photographer is one of the subjects.

We came to the idea of having a murder game, where each of us would play a certain role. While thinking about this idea I recognized it would be cool if Alexa would be able to facilitate the solving of such a murder mystery. Hence the idea was born to develop this skill.    Drew inspiration from floods in my Country. How we used certain applications to keep in touch with each other.

The Lightning Network is an amazing new technology that I watched blossom from an idea to main net. I decided that I wanted to participate in this historical project by running my own full node. However, my laptop's storage capacity was insufficient. So, I went out to pick up an external drive and figured out how to store the blockchain there so I could make my first lightning purchase.   Social application to help students We get inspired by the willing of proofing and giving evidence of the effectiveness of the Progress App Evo strategy and approach by running a 30 minutes demo, tailored on customer needs that was enclosing years of experience on the field.   The applications of deep learning in the medical field are enormous. Unfortunately, the learning curve makes it difficult for doctors to make predictive models. That's where we believe a platform like D.S.F.H can help them and make their experience better. My inspiration is my parents and that section of society who want to enjoy the benefits of fast and rising technology. Our current project resolves 3 problems which commonly people face, namely-  building websites from handmade drawing, job dashboards, and other small services and feedback providers.

This past month, California wildfires resulted in 300,000 people being evacuated and 3,000,000 being displaced due to power outages. Each year, millions of people are faced with the challenge of attaining food, shelter, and other basic necessities after being uprooted because of natural disasters. While there are resources available to those who have been displaced, there are not nearly enough to accommodate everyone, and there is no effective application that can help them find these resources...YET.   Despite the vast amount of resources in San Francisco, there's no easy way to access that information and most people are not aware of their options. As college freshmen without much coding experience, we were inspired to participate in this event in order to learn and get some experience under our belt. We also wanted to make a project to get a better sense of what it is like to be software developers and understand the field to consider for our future career paths. Wanting to create an application that can help our community know about extreme emergencies directly to their phones.  Plenty of people are looking to volunteer in Homelessness. However, it's not a curated experience. It's not fun. There's no user journey.     We met the people from Geico and started talking about how having alerts for people to know what the weather and road conditions.   Doctors spend 50% of their time just typing. Our inspiration solely was to enjoy ourselves this weekend and make something fun. Just to try to work out of our comfort zone and try to learn new things as we go along. The commonality of preventable gym injuries as experienced by us, more recently a close friend, inspired us to work towards an application. A study conducted between 1990 to 2007 indicated that nearly 1 MILLION Americans came into the ER with weightlifting injuries. We want to decrease these unnecessary injuries and promote proper, healthy form and techniques during exercise.  I was inspired by the drive of the people around me to succeed, and I find myself a part of that movement.  Working for hours and hours on a project, while not the most high-level thing, is a reward in itself. Today's world increasingly interacts with natural disasters and climate phenomena, in large part caused by anthropomorphic global warming, For many of us, not only in the US but also around the world, access to definitive pipelines for connections and educational resources is severely lacking, and thus FloodGate provides a streamlined path to help the students, community leaders, and people of the future get a headstart.  After doing research on the biggest problems people face when it comes to natural disasters, I realized it could make a huge difference if people had the proper technological tools to handle the most common issues. I developed software that first responders and local governments can use to evaluate the impact of the disaster, and a phone application that residents can use to quickly see what's going on.  Help facilitate and expedite the process of rescuing victims of natural disasters by creating an easy to use visualization of who needs rescuing and what they need. Everyone knows how hard it is to find street parking in the busy city of San Francisco. As a group, we have all had experiences where we go into the city for a shopping trip, a stroll around Golden Gate park or even an hour-long job interview, but end up wasting the day looking for cheap parking. According to an Inrix study of 6,000 U.S. drivers in 10 American cities, the average San Franciscan driver spends 83 hours a year looking for parking. During this time, these drivers add to congestion and air pollution while wasting gas money. So we decided to make a solution to this problem!   Back in 2016, an earthquake hit my country. During that time many roads got destroyed and many people did not get assistance on time. What if authorities or anyone could construct temporary roads with just their phones? What if we could get a distress signal from someone close and help them before it's too late?  We were inspired by a combination of the tracks offered here at HackDuke. Although we were technically limited to just one track, we wanted to try our best and influence all five tracks - helping nonprofits that support education, socioeconomic inequality, health and wellness, and in the future, hopefully also benefit energy and environmental nonprofits. Our idea was founded based on tip jars and “rounding up” at gas stations and restaurants, where even the smallest amount can go a long way. We truly believe that we can make a macro difference with microdonations. Our inspiration comes from finding those interested in studying the same topic but are disconnected from one another. With this app, users are able to know when others are studying for an upcoming exam and are able to join them without necessarily being close to them.  After seeing the fires in Northern California, and reading articles about the state of the utility lines, we thought of making Safeify. Reduced visibility, rain, and snow are among the top predictors of traffic fatalities.  Our project takes a data-driven approach to risk analysis through weather APIs and modeling of crash statistics, making the world a safer place one text at a time!   Some of our inspirations include our love for computer science, the challenge we wanted to face and to try something new.  This was inspired by the reminders that I've seen on my friends' phones and the "oh no's!" I hear every once in a while from my family members — all when they've forgotten to take their pills. It's important to finish medication regimens, especially antibiotics, in order to prevent relapse of infections or even the development of superbugs. It is known that many people don't receive healthcare as soon as possible. Even though they go the urgent care there are still wait times and it will take time to get checked up.  We want to make career advice more accessible to students, especially those who may not be privileged to have a large network yet. The Textron and JP Morgan challenges inspired us to create an impactful disaster relief solution utilizing geospatial data.  Interested in memory retention and pattern recognition through sound!  Weather change too frequently. It takes too much time to decide what to wear and how to wear correctly each day. In Durham alone, over 43,000 residents live below the poverty line. In a city where the eviction crisis is displacing residents that have lived here for generations, it's more important than ever to ensure that these residents can access the resources necessary to assist them. Although there are dozens of nonprofits in Durham that are eager to help, not having access to reliable transportation and conflicting hours of operation can make it difficult for individuals to access these resources. Regardless of situation, the vast majority of people who live below the poverty line or are homeless have a smartphone and with our app, they'll be able to use it to access these crucial resources.   There really isn't a great tool that allows us to collaborate on projects in real time. Jira is a nice piece of software, but the issue is that every time we try to collaborate on a card with teammates, we must refresh a page to see changes. We decided there was a better way, so we created Vibe. There is $42.8 billion per year in food waste in the US. The current state of expiration labels in the world is overly complicated and results in massive amounts of food waste. We have all seen the combinations of "Best by", "Use by", and "Sell by" dates on the expiration labels of all sorts of products. Upon doing further research, we realized that these terms do not actually convey the expiration date of the product. For example, the term "best buy" is when the flavor is the best, not when the product expires. Over 33% of participants in a study conducted last year incorrectly assumed date labeling is federally regulated and another 26% were unsure. With Expirology, we aim to create a system for managing expiration dates based on the USDA database of refrigerator shelf life, rather than the confusing manufacturer labels.    When we designed and wrote this program, we were very inspired by the way the challenge options we chose could all intertwine with one another in relation to weather, in a way that betters life for the user. Considering the importance of Shodor to the Durham community, it is important that they are able to put their best foot forward and attract new talent throughout the Triangle area. By redesigning their website, we have created a more inviting experience for the user which will make them more inclined to pursue opportunities through Shodor.  Prize money(Duh!)StorylineA natural calamity has just hit the east coast. The devastation is inexpressible and the response teams have been on high alert. Huge number of victims have been requesting help online directed towards friends and authorities. A team from PSU brought a “smart mobilization system” to aid the response teams. All the users sending the emergency appeals are now channeled through a central App and a “cool” NLP module is helping the teams to direct the required help towards the victims. All without any hassle. Furthermore, the team has helped the ERU (Emergency Response Units) with a wildfire in no time. No wonder, the team has won many hearts and definitely won the HackPSU. Our team was inspired by Augmented Reality's ability bringing the virtual world to our surroundings. Whereas not all people are able to gain full information on environmental crises, they are happening just around us and influence each individual's life.  On The Move aims to help people make moving easy! It provides common indicators of county health and visualizes it all in one easy interface.What it DoesOn The Move asks the user for a county and returns information on common factors including high school graduation rate, median housing cost, and crime rate, etc. and compares that county to all other counties in the U.S. through data visualization. The web app incorporates finance by allowing the user to make smarter decisions based on factors such as medical conditions and housing. Also, we used machine learning, specifically k-means clustering, to list counties similar to the user's county input based on various features.How we built itWe built a website using HTML, Node.js, and CSS that takes in a user’s input. We also wrote a python script using pandas to reformat all of the data files into a standardized format. We also created an R script that takes the user input and the data and visualizes it in the form of histograms, scatter plots, line graphs, etc.Challenges we ran intoFormatting the data was a challenge because there were a lot of columns that had information that was not relevant to our visualizations. There were also differentiations in the way counties were named and we had to standardize it. Accomplishments that we’re proud ofWe were able to code this web app with our team being at least 50% novice.What we learnedWe learned a lot about R, HTML, .csv files, pandas, Python, Github and most importantly, how to work as a team!What’s next for On The MoveIdeally, we would love to have more features like 3-D visualizations and more datasets. Given more time, we would add a feature that includes a ranking of the best counties based on all of the features we have.Built Withcssdatahtmljavascriptjupyter-notebooknode.jspythonrTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    HackDuke: Code for Good 2019    Created by  I worked on front-end.

Many people fear that they will be pestered to give more after giving once. The growth of a cashless society means that fewer people are carrying change in the first place. Most do not like giving to a person whom they have no personal connection with. There are deeper underlying issues in the homeless population that include mental and physical help, and there are many professionals who want to help but have no way of getting in contact with a person  develop my space=> devmy.space I have always been inspired by my passion for sports and programming.  We are on the Energy & Environment track. Our idea is that we want to make people aware of the energy consuming. Highest consumption is in people's homes and individual transport. Hence we want to create a web tool that can calculate a score by which people can compare their environmental impacts with each other. We wanted to create something that people can enjoy and at the same time engage and contribute to save the environment.  DinoSoar is the brainchild application of four Duke novice hackers who hope to inspire social good and an energy-efficient future! We understand how difficult it can be to consolidate data from different platforms. In CodeNation, students' data is saved in one platform while the analysis of students' performance is expected to be processed in another platform.  If we can come up with a one-button-click way to retrieve data from one workspace and transport to their favorite demonstration tool, we can help people in CodeNatoin to avoid all data processing hassle and focus more on the real work.  Improvement is what we strive for. We strongly believe that in order to grow, we need to be able to find methods of measuring our current state, and identifying ways that we can improve. This belief of ours aligned perfectly with what Codenation wished for hackers to develop.   The CODA challenge was to synchronize a node with the live CODA testnet and create a cool visualization using the CODA GraphQL API.  Mental health is a problem that, as college students, we are acutely aware of. Just last week at Georgia Tech, another students commit suicide. Whether it is academic stress or depression, these problems are all too prevalent. Isolation is from others is one aspect of this issue; often times, students feel like they can not find anyone else that understands the problems that they are facing.   We know there is going to be an impending recession. That is why we want to make sure every American is ready for retirement. More than 60% of Senior citizens have not enough savings to survive their rest of their lives without any help from others. Twitter data is one of the most openly available data-set for analysis. But in the current scenario of analysis, twitter data and hashtag analytics arent enough to give the bigger picture of how a particular topic effects a given political biome. We hence wanted to grow this said search to include a more representative picture by including multifaceted information, through statistics, and hence showing a greater solution to any given problem.  Personal finance is something that is extremely interesting to me. I spend countless hours on the internet watching videos and reading articles. I was intrigued as soon as I heard about Vanguard's challenge. There were so many topics I wanted to incorporate into my project, but I can't create a service like Mint or Credit Karma in a day, so I decided to focus on what I think is a critical idea that millennials need to think about - retirement.  There's always room for improvement when it comes to the food served on planes.  Gordon Ramsey, Artificial Intelligence and MathsWhat we learnt:How to manage expectations of a project. Making necessary simplifications to get a workable solution.What we built:We successfully developed a web app that uses the food detection algorithm that we developed using python. In addition to that physics of heat transfer in food items was also applied to calculate cooking times and to develop heat map data for different types of meats and habitat (Earth vs Mars). Interface between three different components of the project was also successfully established!Challenges we faced:We wanted to measure the thickness of the meat cuts but ran out of time to do so. Heat transfer analysis for different types of shapes such as cylindrical, spherical also couldn't be implemented due to time constraint.Built WithbashhtmljavascriptlatexpythonreactTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    McGill Physics Hackathon 2019    Created by  lcampanari Vert Hong Kong riotsNatural disasters  A.I. may prove to be the most powerful thing humans have ever invented. Many people are unsure about it or even afraid of it. But also not many people know that A.I. can create interesting and beautiful art. And who doesn't love art?I want to make A.I. more accessible through a trading card game where you collect and trade A.I. generated art. Also, the idea of an art discovery/creation marketplace is interesting and unexplored.  Protecting Earth's most precious natural environments - such as the Amazon rainforest - is often dangerously dependent on unstable political and economic forces. While the Amazon's critical importance as a carbon sink, source of oxygen, and biodiversity hotspot is widely acknowledged worldwide, the local economics in inhabited portions of the forest are often not conducive to protecting this planetary treasure. Instead of relying on government policies and inefficient charities, what if we could create a decentralized economic vehicle that made long-term protection of the forest economically beneficial for local residents?  We were inspired to combine the medical field and deep learning to be able to address one of the most common dermatological diagnosis issue in a very accessible and simple manner Human forgetfulness is bad, and we need ways to remind ourselves to do things. In my biomedical research laboratory, people forget to order fresh lab supplies. These supplies include ingredients to a drug, reagents for a diagnostic device... anything! This means we can accidentally be using expired reagents or have development delays because of this oversight. To reduce the burden of needing to remember to order new lab supplies (when it's tough to, when you're in a lab with no computer around...) I made a Amazon Dash-like device with buttons that users can press, which sends an email and text to the lab manager requesting ordering of low supplies. A Flask server I deployed on a Google Cloud Platform Instance receives the button press POST request, sends that email/text, logs the request in MongoDB Atlas, and will send emails in the future of supply expiry - when the new supplies come, the server will send reminders that we should throw away the new supplies after their expiry.How I built itThe device is simple, using 4 simple tactile buttons wired to a Particle Photon, which connects via webhooks to a Flask server deployed to a Google Cloud Platform VM instance. The Flask server uses the MongoDB Atlas API to save all button press requests for order confirmation and supply information, Twilio to send texts to users, and Sendgrid to send emails as well. The enclosure was designed in SolidWorks, sliced in Cura, and printed on a Lulzbot Taz6 and Creality CR-10mini. What's next for buttonsI will see how I can couple the device to actually order supplies directly- like the Amazon Dash button. I will also add more functionality to the buttons-- and will build more button devices! The device can also be used by consumers- put this device on your fridge so you get reminded to throw out that old milk, or to use your peppers before they go moldy! The platform is really versatile.Built Withflaskgcpmongodbpythonsendgridtwiliovm      Submitted to    HackDuke: Code for Good 2019    Created by  I did everything. :)Jason Liu Artificial Intelligence/Utilizing AI Traditional approach for Payrolls doesn't enforce record immutability once agreed upon.  Once I couldn't find my passport on time to board a flight. That's why I came up with this idea.  Decentralized exchanges (DEXes) provide services that are almost identical to those available from traditional centralized exchange (CEXes), but at substantially higher prices. This price discrepancy is clearly reflected in usage statistics. Today, DEXes mediate less than one percent of daily crypto trading volume. To work towards changing this, we decided to focus on a single segment of the exchange sector, stablecoin swaps, where DEXes have the largest potential cost advantage. Our product, Squink, will enable users to swap between different stablecoins at less than half of the cost of any existing service.   Knowing people who are soldiers and veterans, we recognize the growing need to keep the technologies used to train soldiers updated to better prepare them. Currently instructors still grade soldiers using paper and clipboards. This is an incredibly inefficient process; instructors need to manually print out scoring sheets from a computer system thank takes a very long time to fire up. This can cost them up to an hour in the morning before training exercises.Pen and paper scoring in the field is tedious, especially when instructors are trying to focus on what soldiers are doing in high stress environments.After field exercises, instructors need to reenter all the data they have collected by hand into a database that is unable to perform any sort of data analysis or visualization. The problem that we as students i.e. members of the communities on campus and leaders of communities face every single day. Home Depot giving back challenge.

We are excited about Aave's flash loan protocol and the potential it has on the de-fi space.   Voting sucks, we're looking to make it better.  -TeamTrees movementOur project was inspired by seeing the high amount of enthusiasm generated by the Arbor Day Foundation’s Team Trees. Team trees pledges to plant one tree for every dollar donated and has within a few weeks reached $12 Million of their stated $20 Million goal.-Converting energy to actionSeeing the energy behind Team Trees spurred us to ask “How can we channel this energy to fuel more environmental activism and engagement.” That’s how we came up with Sprig. Transitioning from living in one city to another can always be jarring change.  Although the novelty can be exhilarating, taking flight and seeking out a new social support system may prove to be a daunting task.  Yet, no matter the people we hold close in our lives, from those we’ve known our entire lives to the lab partner we met just a few weeks ago, having those people in our community means the same: ensuring that we feel connected, safe, and taken care of.We wanted to make that process of building and maintaining community easier.  Especially in a major metropolitan city like Austin, safety can be of paramount concern.  Whether they walk, scooter, or rideshare, our final salutation in seeing people off is wishing them safe travels.  Even after departing the nest, Birdie lets you and your loved ones know that those in your community have made it to their destination safely. What is DoesOur app allows users to send/share a history of their location data to those within their community.  The sender presses a button to start their trip, sending friends/family a notification.  From there, receivers can view the person’s trip by viewing the path they followed on a map.  Afterwards, the sender presses a button to end the trip they scheduled, allowing others to know they arrived safely.What Makes it Different?Other location trackers only provide a live view of where people are.  Although this is useful, allowing others to be notified of when you take a trip allows for a practical experience.  For instance, you can send your location on FaceBook messenger, but this can get lost in the messages.  Apps like Strava may be able to track paths you take, but are primarily geared towards running and exercise without having features dedicated to safety.  We wanted an elegant app dedicated for safety that allows for convenient, practical sharing of location.How we Built itWe created our app in Android App Studio, using Google Firebase as a server to store and transmit location data.  We also utilized Google Maps API in order to create a live tracking experience.Challenges we Ran IntoMerging all files together, debuggingAccomplishmentsUsing FireBase to store and transmit data, and creating a smooth interface with Google Maps APIWhat We LearnedLots about mobile app development and data transmission with servers!What’s Next?Account registration, history of tracked paths, integrating FaceBook API to better connect with community and import friends listsBuilt withBuilt in Java with Android App Studio,Google Maps API, Google FireBaseVideo LinksBirdie Demo: https://youtu.be/GyO6vxuHv2oBirdie Demo 2: https://youtu.be/TrOoyVImki0Built Withandroid-studiofirebasegoogle-mapsjavaxmlTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    HackTX 2019    Created by  Worked on permissions to enable fine location tracking.

Compound currently has volatile interest rates, we wanted to give more stability to the lending market for the good of humanity. Binance DEX is the biggest DEX out there right now and it is predicted to gain adoption in coming days and months. Binance and other upcoming exchanges like Kava are built on top of Cosmos-SDK, making the eco-system an ideal candidate for the Defi projects.This project is directly inspired by Compound.finance but it has it's own ambitions, other than supporting native BEP-2 tokens via IBC, the project aims to operate on a slightly different economic model. Allowing any relayer to earn fee through the native token of the chain and also just about anyone would be able to create their own money markets on the platform.   We believe that electronic health records are a technological necessity going into the next decade. The digitization of records allows for rapid access to patient health history, increased privacy and security of information, and even predictive healthcare utilizing machine learning.  Many hospitals in developing and rural areas haven't transitioned from handwritten records to electronic health records yet. Through developing mediScan, we hope that we can help others digitize their medical information towards a healthier and smarter future. We were inspired by the viral internet phenomenon #TrashTag, where people would clean a public space and upload photos of them doing so to social media. Climate change is one of the 21st century's foremost challenges, and we all live our daily lives barely thinking about it. There are many ways that we unknowingly accelerate climate change, and one of those ways is online consumerism. Many people have moved to online consumerism because of its convenience, but that convenience comes at a cost. With so many options, it's common to pick the fastest and easiest option, but we hope to allow people to make an informed purchasing decision by showing the environmental cost of each choice.  We were inspired by the friends of family around us that live their lives fighting depression everyday. It's easy to forget about depression when you don't have to deal with it. But for people with depression they have to fight its battle everyday no matter what's happening. That's why as a team, we want to build tools that can help. While exploring how we could compete in multiple challenges we found AR particularly interesting and thought it would be useful for both real world applications and the Hackathon to create a platform which made it easy to create many AR experiences. We have recently observed that modern definition of capitalism has become based on profit maximization, rather than its intent of a more humanistic approach. This can be observed in recent headlines such as, Amazon employees'  work-life balance and Martin Schkerli's overpriced EpiPen. Our solution puts the power back into the hand of the investors and lets them communicate how they value seven social metrics. We got inspired by the CapitalOne team who suggested we create something to innovate on transaction and financial technology. We decided to apply our knowledge on ethereum blockchain in order to integrate with regular bank accounts. As aspiring software engineers, we spend countless hours honing our technical abilities in order to secure a prestigious job title. Our intense focus and dedication to solving practice problems, however, blinds us. We give praise the resources that has provided us a platform to prepare us for our dream jobs, but forget to appreciate the resource that gives us everything we have, the real prize, Mother Earth. Our solution is to provide a platform that advances careers and gives back to Mother Nature. Natural disasters are a very frightening problem that requires short-term and long-term solutions. Recently, Texas suffered from Hurricane Harvey, so we were inspired to create a mobile application to create a community for people that need financial support as well as clothing, food, and toiletries donations. In fact, during Hurricane Harvey, one of our team member's dad went out for disaster relief and support, so we wanted to make it easier for others to contribute.
