Our inspiration comes from finding those interested in studying the same topic but are disconnected from one another. With this app, users are able to know when others are studying for an upcoming exam and are able to join them without necessarily being close to them.  
 After seeing the fires in Northern California, and reading articles about the state of the utility lines, we thought of making Safeify. 
 Reduced visibility, rain, and snow are among the top predictors of traffic fatalities.  Our project takes a data-driven approach to risk analysis through weather APIs and modeling of crash statistics, making the world a safer place one text at a time! 
  
  
 Some of our inspirations include our love for computer science, the challenge we wanted to face and to try something new.  
 This was inspired by the reminders that I've seen on my friends' phones and the "oh no's!" I hear every once in a while from my family members — all when they've forgotten to take their pills. It's important to finish medication regimens, especially antibiotics, in order to prevent relapse of infections or even the development of superbugs. 
 It is known that many people don't receive healthcare as soon as possible. Even though they go the urgent care there are still wait times and it will take time to get checked up.  
 We want to make career advice more accessible to students, especially those who may not be privileged to have a large network yet. 
 The Textron and JP Morgan challenges inspired us to create an impactful disaster relief solution utilizing geospatial data.

 Weather change too frequently. It takes too much time to decide what to wear and how to wear correctly each day. 
 In Durham alone, over 43,000 residents live below the poverty line. In a city where the eviction crisis is displacing residents that have lived here for generations, it's more important than ever to ensure that these residents can access the resources necessary to assist them. Although there are dozens of nonprofits in Durham that are eager to help, not having access to reliable transportation and conflicting hours of operation can make it difficult for individuals to access these resources. Regardless of situation, the vast majority of people who live below the poverty line or are homeless have a smartphone and with our app, they'll be able to use it to access these crucial resources. 
  
  
 There really isn't a great tool that allows us to collaborate on projects in real time. Jira is a nice piece of software, but the issue is that every time we try to collaborate on a card with teammates, we must refresh a page to see changes. We decided there was a better way, so we created Vibe. 
 There is $42.8 billion per year in food waste in the US. The current state of expiration labels in the world is overly complicated and results in massive amounts of food waste. We have all seen the combinations of "Best by", "Use by", and "Sell by" dates on the expiration labels of all sorts of products. Upon doing further research, we realized that these terms do not actually convey the expiration date of the product. For example, the term "best buy" is when the flavor is the best, not when the product expires. Over 33% of participants in a study conducted last year incorrectly assumed date labeling is federally regulated and another 26% were unsure. With Expirology, we aim to create a system for managing expiration dates based on the USDA database of refrigerator shelf life, rather than the confusing manufacturer labels. 
  
  
  
 When we designed and wrote this program, we were very inspired by the way the challenge options we chose could all intertwine with one another in relation to weather, in a way that betters life for the user. 
 Considering the importance of Shodor to the Durham community, it is important that they are able to put their best foot forward and attract new talent throughout the Triangle area. By redesigning their website, we have created a more inviting experience for the user which will make them more inclined to pursue opportunities through Shodor.  
 Prize money(Duh!)StorylineA natural calamity has just hit the east coast. The devastation is inexpressible and the response teams have been on high alert. Huge number of victims have been requesting help online directed towards friends and authorities. A team from PSU brought a “smart mobilization system” to aid the response teams. All the users sending the emergency appeals are now channeled through a central App and a “cool” NLP module is helping the teams to direct the required help towards the victims. All without any hassle. Furthermore, the team has helped the ERU (Emergency Response Units) with a wildfire in no time. No wonder, the team has won many hearts and definitely won the HackPSU. 
 Our team was inspired by Augmented Reality's ability bringing the virtual world to our surroundings. Whereas not all people are able to gain full information on environmental crises, they are happening just around us and influence each individual's life.  
 On The Move aims to help people make moving easy! It provides common indicators of county health and visualizes it all in one easy interface.What it DoesOn The Move asks the user for a county and returns information on common factors including high school graduation rate, median housing cost, and crime rate, etc. and compares that county to all other counties in the U.S. through data visualization. The web app incorporates finance by allowing the user to make smarter decisions based on factors such as medical conditions and housing. Also, we used machine learning, specifically k-means clustering, to list counties similar to the user's county input based on various features.How we built itWe built a website using HTML, Node.js, and CSS that takes in a user’s input. We also wrote a python script using pandas to reformat all of the data files into a standardized format. We also created an R script that takes the user input and the data and visualizes it in the form of histograms, scatter plots, line graphs, etc.Challenges we ran intoFormatting the data was a challenge because there were a lot of columns that had information that was not relevant to our visualizations. There were also differentiations in the way counties were named and we had to standardize it. Accomplishments that we’re proud ofWe were able to code this web app with our team being at least 50% novice.What we learnedWe learned a lot about R, HTML, .csv files, pandas, Python, Github and most importantly, how to work as a team!What’s next for On The MoveIdeally, we would love to have more features like 3-D visualizations and more datasets. Given more time, we would add a feature that includes a ranking of the best counties based on all of the features we have.Built Withcssdatahtmljavascriptjupyter-notebooknode.jspythonrTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    HackDuke: Code for Good 2019    Created by  I worked on front-end.

 There is a social stigma of giving the homeless physical dollar bills, due to the fear of them using it for drugs. Many people fear that they will be pestered to give more after giving once. The growth of a cashless society means that fewer people are carrying change in the first place. Most do not like giving to a person whom they have no personal connection with. There are deeper underlying issues in the homeless population that include mental and physical help, and there are many professionals who want to help but have no way of getting in contact with a person

 We are on the Energy & Environment track. Our idea is that we want to make people aware of the energy consuming. Highest consumption is in people's homes and individual transport. Hence we want to create a web tool that can calculate a score by which people can compare their environmental impacts with each other. 
 We wanted to create something that people can enjoy and at the same time engage and contribute to save the environment.

 We understand how difficult it can be to consolidate data from different platforms. In CodeNation, students' data is saved in one platform while the analysis of students' performance is expected to be processed in another platform.  If we can come up with a one-button-click way to retrieve data from one workspace and transport to their favorite demonstration tool, we can help people in CodeNatoin to avoid all data processing hassle and focus more on the real work. 
  
 Improvement is what we strive for. We strongly believe that in order to grow, we need to be able to find methods of measuring our current state, and identifying ways that we can improve. This belief of ours aligned perfectly with what Codenation wished for hackers to develop.

 Mental health is a problem that, as college students, we are acutely aware of. Just last week at Georgia Tech, another students commit suicide. Whether it is academic stress or depression, these problems are all too prevalent. Isolation is from others is one aspect of this issue; often times, students feel like they can not find anyone else that understands the problems that they are facing.  
  
 We know there is going to be an impending recession. That is why we want to make sure every American is ready for retirement. More than 60% of Senior citizens have not enough savings to survive their rest of their lives without any help from others. 
 Twitter data is one of the most openly available data-set for analysis. But in the current scenario of analysis, twitter data and hashtag analytics arent enough to give the bigger picture of how a particular topic effects a given political biome. We hence wanted to grow this said search to include a more representative picture by including multifaceted information, through statistics, and hence showing a greater solution to any given problem.  
 Personal finance is something that is extremely interesting to me. I spend countless hours on the internet watching videos and reading articles. I was intrigued as soon as I heard about Vanguard's challenge. There were so many topics I wanted to incorporate into my project, but I can't create a service like Mint or Credit Karma in a day, so I decided to focus on what I think is a critical idea that millennials need to think about - retirement.

 Gordon Ramsey, Artificial Intelligence and MathsWhat we learnt:How to manage expectations of a project. Making necessary simplifications to get a workable solution.What we built:We successfully developed a web app that uses the food detection algorithm that we developed using python. In addition to that physics of heat transfer in food items was also applied to calculate cooking times and to develop heat map data for different types of meats and habitat (Earth vs Mars). Interface between three different components of the project was also successfully established!Challenges we faced:We wanted to measure the thickness of the meat cuts but ran out of time to do so. Heat transfer analysis for different types of shapes such as cylindrical, spherical also couldn't be implemented due to time constraint.Built WithbashhtmljavascriptlatexpythonreactTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    McGill Physics Hackathon 2019    Created by  lcampanari Vert

 A.I. may prove to be the most powerful thing humans have ever invented. Many people are unsure about it or even afraid of it. But also not many people know that A.I. can create interesting and beautiful art. And who doesn't love art?I want to make A.I. more accessible through a trading card game where you collect and trade A.I. generated art. Also, the idea of an art discovery/creation marketplace is interesting and unexplored.  
 Protecting Earth's most precious natural environments - such as the Amazon rainforest - is often dangerously dependent on unstable political and economic forces. While the Amazon's critical importance as a carbon sink, source of oxygen, and biodiversity hotspot is widely acknowledged worldwide, the local economics in inhabited portions of the forest are often not conducive to protecting this planetary treasure. Instead of relying on government policies and inefficient charities, what if we could create a decentralized economic vehicle that made long-term protection of the forest economically beneficial for local residents?  
 We were inspired to combine the medical field and deep learning to be able to address one of the most common dermatological diagnosis issue in a very accessible and simple manner 
 Human forgetfulness is bad, and we need ways to remind ourselves to do things. In my biomedical research laboratory, people forget to order fresh lab supplies. These supplies include ingredients to a drug, reagents for a diagnostic device... anything! This means we can accidentally be using expired reagents or have development delays because of this oversight. To reduce the burden of needing to remember to order new lab supplies (when it's tough to, when you're in a lab with no computer around...) I made a Amazon Dash-like device with buttons that users can press, which sends an email and text to the lab manager requesting ordering of low supplies. A Flask server I deployed on a Google Cloud Platform Instance receives the button press POST request, sends that email/text, logs the request in MongoDB Atlas, and will send emails in the future of supply expiry - when the new supplies come, the server will send reminders that we should throw away the new supplies after their expiry.How I built itThe device is simple, using 4 simple tactile buttons wired to a Particle Photon, which connects via webhooks to a Flask server deployed to a Google Cloud Platform VM instance. The Flask server uses the MongoDB Atlas API to save all button press requests for order confirmation and supply information, Twilio to send texts to users, and Sendgrid to send emails as well. The enclosure was designed in SolidWorks, sliced in Cura, and printed on a Lulzbot Taz6 and Creality CR-10mini. What's next for buttonsI will see how I can couple the device to actually order supplies directly- like the Amazon Dash button. I will also add more functionality to the buttons-- and will build more button devices! The device can also be used by consumers- put this device on your fridge so you get reminded to throw out that old milk, or to use your peppers before they go moldy! The platform is really versatile.Built Withflaskgcpmongodbpythonsendgridtwiliovm      Submitted to    HackDuke: Code for Good 2019    Created by  I did everything. :)Jason Liu

 Decentralized exchanges (DEXes) provide services that are almost identical to those available from traditional centralized exchange (CEXes), but at substantially higher prices. This price discrepancy is clearly reflected in usage statistics. Today, DEXes mediate less than one percent of daily crypto trading volume. To work towards changing this, we decided to focus on a single segment of the exchange sector, stablecoin swaps, where DEXes have the largest potential cost advantage. Our product, Squink, will enable users to swap between different stablecoins at less than half of the cost of any existing service.   
 Knowing people who are soldiers and veterans, we recognize the growing need to keep the technologies used to train soldiers updated to better prepare them. Currently instructors still grade soldiers using paper and clipboards. This is an incredibly inefficient process; instructors need to manually print out scoring sheets from a computer system thank takes a very long time to fire up. This can cost them up to an hour in the morning before training exercises.Pen and paper scoring in the field is tedious, especially when instructors are trying to focus on what soldiers are doing in high stress environments.After field exercises, instructors need to reenter all the data they have collected by hand into a database that is unable to perform any sort of data analysis or visualization.

 -TeamTrees movementOur project was inspired by seeing the high amount of enthusiasm generated by the Arbor Day Foundation’s Team Trees. Team trees pledges to plant one tree for every dollar donated and has within a few weeks reached $12 Million of their stated $20 Million goal.-Converting energy to actionSeeing the energy behind Team Trees spurred us to ask “How can we channel this energy to fuel more environmental activism and engagement.” That’s how we came up with Sprig. 
 Transitioning from living in one city to another can always be jarring change.  Although the novelty can be exhilarating, taking flight and seeking out a new social support system may prove to be a daunting task.  Yet, no matter the people we hold close in our lives, from those we’ve known our entire lives to the lab partner we met just a few weeks ago, having those people in our community means the same: ensuring that we feel connected, safe, and taken care of.We wanted to make that process of building and maintaining community easier.  Especially in a major metropolitan city like Austin, safety can be of paramount concern.  Whether they walk, scooter, or rideshare, our final salutation in seeing people off is wishing them safe travels.  Even after departing the nest, Birdie lets you and your loved ones know that those in your community have made it to their destination safely. What is DoesOur app allows users to send/share a history of their location data to those within their community.  The sender presses a button to start their trip, sending friends/family a notification.  From there, receivers can view the person’s trip by viewing the path they followed on a map.  Afterwards, the sender presses a button to end the trip they scheduled, allowing others to know they arrived safely.What Makes it Different?Other location trackers only provide a live view of where people are.  Although this is useful, allowing others to be notified of when you take a trip allows for a practical experience.  For instance, you can send your location on FaceBook messenger, but this can get lost in the messages.  Apps like Strava may be able to track paths you take, but are primarily geared towards running and exercise without having features dedicated to safety.  We wanted an elegant app dedicated for safety that allows for convenient, practical sharing of location.How we Built itWe created our app in Android App Studio, using Google Firebase as a server to store and transmit location data.  We also utilized Google Maps API in order to create a live tracking experience.Challenges we Ran IntoMerging all files together, debuggingAccomplishmentsUsing FireBase to store and transmit data, and creating a smooth interface with Google Maps APIWhat We LearnedLots about mobile app development and data transmission with servers!What’s Next?Account registration, history of tracked paths, integrating FaceBook API to better connect with community and import friends listsBuilt withBuilt in Java with Android App Studio,Google Maps API, Google FireBaseVideo LinksBirdie Demo: https://youtu.be/GyO6vxuHv2oBirdie Demo 2: https://youtu.be/TrOoyVImki0Built Withandroid-studiofirebasegoogle-mapsjavaxmlTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    HackTX 2019    Created by  Worked on permissions to enable fine location tracking.

 Binance DEX is the biggest DEX out there right now and it is predicted to gain adoption in coming days and months. Binance and other upcoming exchanges like Kava are built on top of Cosmos-SDK, making the eco-system an ideal candidate for the Defi projects.This project is directly inspired by Compound.finance but it has it's own ambitions, other than supporting native BEP-2 tokens via IBC, the project aims to operate on a slightly different economic model. Allowing any relayer to earn fee through the native token of the chain and also just about anyone would be able to create their own money markets on the platform.  
  
 We believe that electronic health records are a technological necessity going into the next decade. The digitization of records allows for rapid access to patient health history, increased privacy and security of information, and even predictive healthcare utilizing machine learning.  Many hospitals in developing and rural areas haven't transitioned from handwritten records to electronic health records yet. Through developing mediScan, we hope that we can help others digitize their medical information towards a healthier and smarter future. 
 We were inspired by the viral internet phenomenon #TrashTag, where people would clean a public space and upload photos of them doing so to social media. 
 Climate change is one of the 21st century's foremost challenges, and we all live our daily lives barely thinking about it. There are many ways that we unknowingly accelerate climate change, and one of those ways is online consumerism. Many people have moved to online consumerism because of its convenience, but that convenience comes at a cost. With so many options, it's common to pick the fastest and easiest option, but we hope to allow people to make an informed purchasing decision by showing the environmental cost of each choice.  
 We were inspired by the friends of family around us that live their lives fighting depression everyday. It's easy to forget about depression when you don't have to deal with it. But for people with depression they have to fight its battle everyday no matter what's happening. That's why as a team, we want to build tools that can help. 
 While exploring how we could compete in multiple challenges we found AR particularly interesting and thought it would be useful for both real world applications and the Hackathon to create a platform which made it easy to create many AR experiences. 
 We have recently observed that modern definition of capitalism has become based on profit maximization, rather than its intent of a more humanistic approach. This can be observed in recent headlines such as, Amazon employees'  work-life balance and Martin Schkerli's overpriced EpiPen. Our solution puts the power back into the hand of the investors and lets them communicate how they value seven social metrics.

Our solution is to provide a platform that advances careers and gives back to Mother Nature. 
 Natural disasters are a very frightening problem that requires short-term and long-term solutions. Recently, Texas suffered from Hurricane Harvey, so we were inspired to create a mobile application to create a community for people that need financial support as well as clothing, food, and toiletries donations. In fact, during Hurricane Harvey, one of our team member's dad went out for disaster relief and support, so we wanted to make it easier for others to contribute. 
 Our objective was to integrate the Fitbit watch to help victims of natural disasters be located in high risk areas. To take it a step further we added a feature utilizing the Fitbit's sensors to track a person's vitals to help search and rescue responders locate more add risk victims in critical conditions based on logs of their vitals.  
  
 Imagine you're sitting in a large lecture hall like Griffith Theater, listening to your Computer Architecture professor lecture about caches. There are 200 other people in your class, and when you realize you do not understand how the different types of cache misses work, you are too intimidated to ask. This app addresses that problem.

 Pokemon is an insanely popular app worldwide that allows players to catch pokemon and battle each other. We applied this model to helping the earth, by allowing people to organize clean up events and encourage others to attend. The incentive for attending one of these Earth-saving events is to tag a new bat of varying rarity. Will you and your bat buddies be able to save the earth? 
 Over the course of the brainstorming session, we ended up deciding to work on a project that would aid those primarily affected by natural disasters with the possibility of endless applications in other emergency scenarios. The project revolves around improving connectivity between communities affected by these adverse conditions. 
  
 From our collective experience, combatting inequality is not solved by simply putting people of different backgrounds in the same room. At a high school level, we noticed that dividing up into teams, specifically for group projects, was very much inline with privilege - a psychological effect known as in group favoritism. As a result, the effects of inequality became amplified, and social mobility becomes nearly impossible. Similarly, people with similar personality traits tend to group together, which minimizes diversity of thought and leads to, on average, worse team performance (Hoffman and Maier, 1961). Using the "big five" personality factors that determine team success (Kichuk and Wiesner, 1997), we created a tool that would prioritize diversity of thought in group creation - with aims of improving group performance and enhancing social mobility. 
 A while ago we explored sentiment analysis when it came to weather, but after a refactor, we can explore sentiment against being ill or sick. In addition, when we take into account the weather and the CDC's reported influenza outbreak, we can see if any interesting or emergent patterns exist.

 We always wondered how physics is applied in fields outside of it. Reading its applications in finance, we were inspired to explore this phenomenon and create a simulation of our own.  
 It’s not a secret that cars do a lot of damage to our environment. They produce tons of toxic pollutants and chemicals that result in greenhouse emissions, acid rain, climate change, and significant water and air pollution.This environmental damage also influences people’s health ranging from minor headaches to cancer to birth defects. We are also wasting lot of time and money by spending time in traffic as a result of having so many cars with just one person in it. That is why we decided to find a way to facilitate carpooling by giving people the opportunity to look for others who are going in the same direction and do a ride sharing with them. In this way, we are reducing the number of cars in the street which results in less air pollution and traffic.InstaPool 
 We were inspired by the keynote speakers at Girls In Tech - Hacking for Humanity (Day 1), speaking directly to members of the organizations and by watching client testimonial videos on the EDC website. Their clients' personal stories motivated our team to build a 'one-stop-shop' website that provides people with access to services that meet their custom needs. 
 Natural disasters present significant challenges to everyone in impacted areas, especially elderly residents. Many elderly people do not make substantial preparations before disaster strikes and are thus more likely to disproportionately suffer the consequences of nature's calamities. We wanted to focus on a technological solution to make responses to natural disasters easier for this user group. 
  
 Cosmos has potential to commoditize blockchain. 
 Inspired by the Starbucks prepaid card app which has more transactions than Apple Pay (according to a speaker from Epicenter). Preloading a small amount of funds to a crypto payment app has less concern for security, allows faster payment processing with little transaction fees, requires no KYC (in certain regions), and allows the user to earn interest by locking some liquidity into Aave or Compound. 
 Any products built in the decentralized finance ecosystem are susceptible to risks from the protocols they are built on top of. This includes both hack risk and systemic financial risk in the case of black swan events like runs on money markets, stablecoins losing their peg etc. These risks have the potential to collapse this entire ecosystem currently worth ~$600M. Lots of users expressed fear that black swan risks caused a DeFi crisis (https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1164935614246072320?s=20)How it worksThis paper explains how the protocol works https://github.com/aparnakr/OptionsProtocol/blob/master/Options_Protocol-2.pdfDelta is an insurance marketplace. Insurance providers earn premiums on their collateral and insurance buyers pay upfront for the right to protect their DeFi assets. In the case of a crisis, the insurance buyer can give up their claims on Compound / Maker in exchange for the collateral that the Insurance providers have locked up in our smart contracts.  
 Inspired by the multiple challenges that encourage giving back to the community and our interest in finance, we designed a way for people to make a change with their spare change. It’s simple, effortless, and requires no knowledge of investments. The idea is that people can opt to round up every purchase they make in their everyday lives and that money will then be invested into stocks, giving it the opportunity to grow. At the end of each month, the money will go to the charity or charities of the user’s choice. Our application provides an easy interface for users to learn about different charities and choose their favorites. It tracks all the money the user has accumulated and utilizes Goldman Sachs’ API to determine the best stocks to invest the money into. It’s only a little bit of change, but over time and through investing, it can make a big difference.

 To provide company and job-seeking students with an eco-friendly way to share and scan resumes. By utilizing computer vision to scan QR codes and read through resumes, were are able to provide both student and employer a better higher experience.What it DoesUtilizing the expansive Google Cloud Platform (GCP) we have integrated a multitude of applications and features that create a better higher experience. First, the journey begins with the student where they can upload their resume, seek out help and improvements from our provided material, and prepare themselves for upcoming events. On the other end of the spectrum, the employers are able to parse through their applicants better and more efficient than ever before.How We Built ItWe focused our efforts as a team on four major components of the application: the client-facing Vue.js application, the mobile application with QR code and NFC capability, our cloud backend, and AI Visualization. These four pillars combine to make a very sturdy and well established code base with a lot of features. Challenges We Ran IntoImplementing the mobile app was extremely challenging due to our groups inexperience with native development. On top of this, there were many challenges in how we implemented our cloud platform due to some friction between deployments.

 Bitcoin's social contract includes a hard limit on the supply with a promise that this feature will help to make it the greatest money to ever exist. Questioning the 21 million hard limit is considered heresy but it is widely unknown what will happen after the emission rate drops to near 0. Hodlers become free loaders and unless there is significant transaction volume, an unstable equilibrium of constant forking at the tip may emerge.

 In today's media driven society it can be difficult to tell whether or not an articles that may have been "tweeted" or "posted" are "fake" or not. Big social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter are constantly being pulled into lawsuits over the spread of these unreliable news sources. With amount of posts on these websites, it is almost impossible for these companies to have a person check over all these posts. To help vulnerable people combat falling into these traps of unreliable news sources, we created Checc News to let the user know whether or not a source is unreliable or not.

 Natural disasters occur all over the world and it is can be considerably difficult to estimate the cost of repairing and supply relief to a given area.  We hope that our estimator will make it easier to get an idea of the costs associated with providing relief to any given natural disaster. 
 Drivers spend on average 17 hours a year searching for parking in the United StatesThe hunt adds up to an estimated $345 per driver in wasted time, fuel, and emissions, according to the analysis by INRIX, a leading specialist in connected car services and transportation analytics.Overpaying — caused by drivers' inability to estimate how long they need to park or forking over extra at a garage to avoid the risk of getting a parking ticket — costs Americans more than $20 billion a yearCurrently available services merely list public parking spaces available. Private parking spaces near venues are available but remain empty. A market does not exist for people to list valuable empty private parking spaces. 
  
 My team's random walk though the space of ideas, eventually diffusing until nothing of them remained.Feedback is a simple process that can create complicated results. Applying it to a stochastic process seemed a natural exploration, and this hackathon was the perfect excuse to spend a weekend doing it.How it was doneMuch python graphing. I learned a lot about matplotlib formatting.Next stepsThe methods for feeding back generated surprisingly predictable results. In future, it would be nice to explore feedback in more interesting systems, as I have explored the space of random walks quite thoroughly.Built WithpythonTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    McGill Physics Hackathon 2019Winner                Best Arts & Science Project                  Created by  1sadtrombone Dyson

 With the recent gain of popularity of Proof of Stake (PoS), we have found out that nearly all research focus only on the security aspects of it. Even though PoS vastly changes the economic fundamentals of a blockchain platform, the actual research done regarding the potential problems that could arise was found to be quite lacking compared to its severity.Through our own analysis of PoS, we have discovered quite a few that can be potentially damaging to the ecosystem. The ones found can largely the classified into three categories: Economic, Security, and Market.Economic: Users are given two choices to invest their tokens, staking and DeFi. This causes DeFi lending rates to rise to a level similar to the staking reward rate, decreasing the amount of social benefit generated from DeFi. It also disincentivizes the usage of DeFi, one example being CDP holders having to miss out on potential staking rewards. Interchain transfers of PoS tokens are also disincentivized, as tokens moved outside of their home chain cannot receive staking rewards. The Cosmos network, aiming to connect various different chains, is critically impacted by this.Security: The only way for delegators to hedge in the case of bear markets is to first go through the unbonding process. This also decreases the network security, creating a situation where the security of the network is impacted by the price fluctuation of tokens. Also, ATOMs being used in dApps cannot be delegated and thus unable to contribute to security. This forces token usage to compete with network security, and since less ATOMs will be bonded, this will also cause the Cosmos Hub to have higher inflation.Market: Users are unable to utilize their bonded ATOMs for hedging or speculation purposes. In addition, since the only entity with an incentive to not bond their ATOMs are centralized exchanges (to process withdrawals), a considerable amount of unbonded ATOMs might end up in the hands them. And since only unbonded ATOMs can be traded and contribute to token valuation, the risk of exchanges colluding with each other and manipulating the price might not be that difficult to pull off.As a small addition to the above problems, developed economies have investment products with various amounts of risk and reward. However, for PoS networks, is not the case (Risk: Slashing Possibility. Reward: Delegation Rewards). Even if there are people who truly believe in the platform prefer to take more risks in exchange for a higher amount of rewards, they have no choice but to follow the same risk & reward profiles as everyone else. 
 Many times we might have come across a situation where we lose concentration while watching a free online lecture video. A short survey that we took during the past few hours supports this fact. 
  
 I recently watched OpenAI's paper on multi-agent hide and seek players. Most of the algorithms and techniques used are very well documented in the paper, and were able to be somewhat nicely ported over to Unity. Instead of using OpenAI's Gym directly, we opted for using Unitys integration with OpenAI, the ML-Agents tool. 
  
 Ahmed's short backstory: I was watching tv late one night while living in Brazil, when the signal cut out. I was mesmerized by the random pattern of pixels oscillating on the screen, knowing that a specific percentage of them were caused by cosmic background radiation. Despite the random cosmic element on the tv screen, the pattern was very similar to the deterministic cellular automata I was playing with on my computer. This fascinated me. One pattern was random and the other was deterministic but not chaotic, and yet, the two were indistinguishable from one another. This inspired me to ask the question: if all it takes to create these crazy patterns are a very simple set of deterministic functions mapping onto one another, then what is random, and what really is chaotic? What else would I be able to produce? There's beauty in chaos. Key wordsHilbert (space filling) curveCellular automataRecursive mappingCombinatronicsDebrujin SequencesMemory

 Today more than ever, the sustainable use of our planet's resources is of paramount importance. Although many individuals, governments, and communities have strove to improve the sustainable aspects of our lives, we feel that an application which gamifies energy and water consumption could have amazing impacts on our everyday behavior. To this end, we were inspired to create just such an application. 
 We believe that tutoring is an integral component of achieving academic success. Duke's current tutoring system is restrictive with a strict one tutor policy, lacks transparency because of the little to no agency a student has in choosing their tutor, and is expected to be an in person interaction. With so much homework, programming, and projects done on computers and online, there is an opportunity for transparent and flexible tutoring to be made available in this environment. For example, most of the work for EGR 103 requires programming. To supplement face-to-face sessions, tutors may want to access a student's machine remotely and provide assistance. This could be particularly helpful for sessions that are late at night or when the individuals are not close by (e.g. a first-year student on East campus and the upper-class tutor on West campus). By providing an online service, data regarding teaching and learning styles can be collected. Analysis of this data can be used to discover relations between different teaching and learning styles which can help improve approaches and strategies to tutoring.  
 Social Media has a huge problem: which is that it contains malicious actors that create posts that are harmful to the community. We wanted to create a system of rewards and accountability for people who participate in flagging harmful content.

 One story that inspired us was from a woman who experienced burglary. She heard loud noises and soon saw a silhouette of an adult man. Frightened by the robber, whom she could not even dare to fight with, and in fear of being discovered, she was unable to call the police.Also, we felt the need for an anonymous texting option for people who had already experienced sexual assault, because people may feel uncomfortable about revealing their identity or even making a phone call and having to speak about their experiences again. Nevertheless, they would need substantial and psychological support from trained counselors.

 The average person can hold only 5 to 9 objects in their working memory at a time, so it comes as no surprise that many important tasks often slip the average person’s memory. We wanted to create an accessible tool that would make remembering tasks and events easier. Through RemindMe, we can empower people of all backgrounds and abilities and make life easier for everyone. 
 In a disaster, the most important piece of information that doesn't reach the masses is how little time they have to get out safely. We are unable to pool in information from the affected communities and this often underestimates the gravity of the situation. We wanted to build a tool to support the most vulnerable, connect affected parts and increase the accessibility of emergency services to areas at risk. 
 Hurricanes are incredibly dangerous and powerful storms, leaving many families dislocated and their homes destroyed.What it DoesHurricane Heroes is a program that uses a binary image classification to detect concentrations of damaged houses to help authorities decide what areas they should focus their efforts.How We Built ItFrom xview2.org, we were able to find a dataset with 1024x1024 images to use as a training data of damaged and undamaged houses after a hurricane. Using satellite and flight imagery found on the National Geodetic Survey, we were able to map out a set of images and create a visual representation to show what areas of the hurricane were most damaged.ChallengesOur biggest challenges were definitely running flask and Azure. It was fairly new territory, which means the learning curve was high, but tinkering with the two programs was more complex than we had first anticipated.AccomplishmentsThe backbone of our product, the classifier, is built with Azure and although the classifier can be more accurate, as it stands right now, is pretty decent. In addition, we were able to link various programs, like Azure, python, and react so that they were able to talk to each other to create a robust code pipeline.What’s Next?There are quite a few ways we can improve the accuracy of our classifier, both algorithmically and with more training data. In terms of functionality, we can expand to other natural disaster events such as tornadoes or earthquakes.Built Withazureflaskjavascriptmachine-learningpythonreactTry it outgithub.comhurricanehero.azurewebsites.net      Submitted to    HackTX 2019    Created by  Debugger/Rubber DuckyMartin NguyenStudent at University of Texas at AustinTaraka Pranav RayuduSahil JainDaehyun KyoungAjith Kemisetti 
 Everyone in our team was affected by Hurricane Harvey. We found that it was difficult to have an organized way to find help and help others. We wanted to create a peer-to-peer platform that can be used to help those who need help along with giving volunteers a platform to help others. Our audience can be volunteers as well as officials such as police. The idea is to have a bunch of drones that go around and track individuals who need help and send help their way.

 One of the issues many patients face is they lack sufficiently reliable information on the qualities of medical services of different hospitals and medical care centers. In order to help them to resolve this problem, we come up with the idea of building an App that fetches information of medical care qualities from reliable datasets and recommend hospitals and medical centers to users. The datasets we use is MEDICARE HOSPITAL COMPARE DATASET, which compares the quality of care at over 4000 Medicare-certified hospitals across the country. 
 One of our teammates, Aditya, was affected by Hurricane Harvey. However, he noticed that during the hurricane,   people’s generosity was on full display. But there was a problem – while some shelters and donation drives overflowed with supplies, others were still empty-handed. Donations were often abundant in certain areas of the city, while the under-served communities that need them most went without. This inspired Full House- a system for managing and balancing the inventory of multiple shelters and leveling the playing field. 
 We were inspired by demonstrations of this effect shown on Youtube. We wanted to see if we could build a simulator to arrive at the same results and to build our own Chladni plate from scratch.

 When Erin McKelvey was getting zero responses to her resume after graduating college. Mack McKelvey, on the other hand, got a 70 percent response rate on applications. It turned out that Woman who switched to man's name on resume goes from 0 to 70 Percent Response Rate. It's indicative of a still-widespread phenomena in the working world called name discrimination (though perhaps it's more germane to just call it discrimination, considering the name itself is merely the vehicle for discriminatory assumptions about the person who holds it). The applications with male names get more responses than those with female names. The phenomena don’t just apply to sex: name associated with particular ethnicities are similarly disadvantaged compared to those with more conventional names. 
 It's registration season at UT Austin again! In a time that's supposed to be filled with hope and excitement, however, many students dread the prospect of seeing all their classes fill up before they register, not knowing which section of a class has the shortest waitlist to sign up for because UT doesn't show the size of a waitlist until a student is already on it. For example, a student picking the waitlist for a class section at random could end up at spot #20. However, he wouldn't know that he could have signed up for a section with only 2 people on the waitlist. After seeing our classmates struggle over the years with getting the classes they need, we decided on a solution of transparency that would let everyone share with each other the sizes of all the waitlists they are on, ultimately enabling them to make an informed decision.

 Our inspiration came from PIMCO’s challenge to allow people to invest morally and promoting positive social change. With complex economies and global supply chains, it is near impossible to enforce proper working conditions in developing nations. Some companies release audits of their factories abroad and even less release a full suppliers list. Our goal is to accumulate the data companies release and display the data to empower users to make decisions within their morals on how to invest their money. 
 Today, most Americans use subscription services on a day-to-day basis throughout their lives. However, there is currently no easy way to manage these services in one place. In order to cancel a subscription you have to remember it, but since most credit card companies don't inform you of monthly charges or you have to go directly through their website to track down these charges, most people don't even know that they are being charged. As a result, we sought a solution that would allow people to manage and cancel their subscription services in one place.

 130,000 square kilometers of forests are cut down or burned every year - equivalent to 3 times the area of Denmark, a football field every 1.4 seconds, or 100 large harvesters working non-stop. Forests cover 30% of eath's land and supply us with the oxygen we need to survive. If we keep up this rate of deforestation, it is estimated that within 100 years there will be no rainforests. What if all it took to slow this mass extinction was to put yourself in the shoes of a tree?

 Part I:How Many People in the United States Have a Disability?According to the 2010 Census, about 56.7 million people — 19% of the population — had a disability according to a broad definition of disability, with more than half of them reporting the disability was severe.There are many facilities for people with disabilities, unfortunately, most of them are not known to the people who needed them the most.Part II:Facts and Statistics about Physical ActivityAccording to the US Department of Health and Human Services, only one in three children are physically active every day. Less than 5% of adults participate in 30 minutes of physical activity each day; only one in three adults receive the recommended amount of physical activity each week.Part III:What if we can kill two birds with one stone?What if by doing more exercise, we can make the city more accessible for the differently-abled population?What if every time we take a walk, we can easily update the accessibility status of the path we walked?Google maps reach over 1 billion users in 2017. We can use the power of crowdsourcing to mark connect accessibility facilities around the world.What can PavePath achieveEvery time you open up Google Maps to find a route for a walk, you will be prompted with the option to update the accessibility status for this path. If you agree to help update the accessibility status, Google Maps can track your walking path. You can easily mark up the obstacles (stairs, narrow lane, etc.) along the way.If a path is already marked as accessible, you can help verify the path.How we built itWe used the Google Maps Javascript API to identify the locations of road blocks for diabled people such as stairs and places under construction and store the locations as Jason objects, which will turn into arrays after parsing.  We then use Google Map Geocoding API and polyline function for displaying all those stored location to disabled user so that they will know which path to use. All the data are stored in local browser storage.Challenges we ran intoImperfection with html and JavaScriptImport, storing and export location dataComing up with strategies to build the database. ( we find the strategy of encouraging normal people to walk the path of disabled people)Finding the real need of disabled people and looking for solutions to help them. (Identification of the topic)Accomplishments that we're proud ofWe are proud of an interactive map and the ability to input the location of road block from the end of normal people and display the location of road block at the end of the disabled people.What we learnedWe have learned how to import, store, and export geolocation data for our database. We also learnt about how to generate useful ideas to help those in need.What's next for PavePathWe are going to integrate this feature as part of Google Maps app. In this way, not only routes for regular transporation but also routes for people in wheelchair or people having other kinds of difficulty are displayed in the app. More importantly, in order to improve the efficiency of data collection, we are going to implement a real-time system to automatically record the routes users have taken into the database. We will then specify the types of disabilities for which the routes are available so that the recommended route options are more personalized. Also, we will provide estimated time for the selected routes.

 What gave us the inspiration for this project was initially the number of people that lacked food security, even among those living in some of the riches cities around the world. One statistic that really stood out was that 37.2 million people or 12% of the population in the nation are food insecure and do not know when or where their next meal will be. Initially, we wanted to tackle hunger since hunger is such a major issue, but we realized that we could also affect those in need of help by tackling other necessities that people may lack.Most people are good people and want to have a positive impact on their society. However, they don’t always remember to do good, and often get caught up in their own daily lives. Our idea is to gently remind people of ways they can be more socially responsible and sustainable.  
  
 Frequently, we found ourselves next to a waste disposal, unsure whether to throw our containers into the garbage or recycling. On one end, we want to be environmentally conscious, but on the other end, we recognize that one misrecycled item can have drastic consequences on the rest of the items placed in the recycling, in extreme cases making entire recycling collections unusable. We were inspired to find a way to use technology and innovation to aid in this conundrum: What exactly is recyclable?

 Our high school orchestra director's family in the Bahamas was impacted by Hurricane Dorian, because of this we were inspired as software engineers to create a project which would aid emergency services in efficiently searching for victims in a natural disaster. 
 We were initially inspired because we saw a problem in our own Duke Community. So many of our peers and even our friends overdose on alcohol and require emergency services. Every weekend, and even many weekdays, we see several ambulances going to pick up another student with alcohol poisoning. This is not only a problem at Duke, but a widespread epidemic at Colleges throughout the U.S. Every year, more than 1500 students die from an alcohol overdose. For our project, we wanted to create something to combat that stunning statistic. Thus our idea to bridge into alcohol safety was born.What it DoesOur project is a wearable that counts the amount of drinks you’ve taken, reminds you to hydrate, times when you can have another drink, and gives you an easy way to contact an emergency number if something went wrong. Specifically, our wearable has a RGB LED light and a piezoelectric sensor. On a timer, the LED lights up blue and sends the user a text reminder about drinking water. Similarly, the wearable times how long between drinks and tells the user when it is ok to drink again, to allow the user to pace themselves throughout the night. Our wearable counts the amount of drinks by the person double tapping on the sensor. Finally, our wearable will contact an emergency number, when the person triple taps the sensor. How We Built ItFirst, we tried to build the project on a Particle Photon board. We were unable to flash code on this device, so we ended up switching to an Arduino. We uploaded firmata code on the Arduino. Firmata allows a python program on a laptop to control and read pins on the Arduino. We then wrote a python program that reads sensor values and sends SMS messages to a specific phone number. Finally, we soldered a circuit that includes the piezoelectric sensor and an RGB LED to a protoboard and protoshield. What We LearnedWe mainly learned the basics of hardware prototyping. We had to program an Arduino and wire up a LED and sensor circuit. We also learned how to design and solder a custom protoboard. We had to make sure it was durable so we hot glued all the connections. After this project, we feel more equipped to try more electronics prototyping in the future. Challenges We FacedWe initially wanted to use a Particle Photon board to read sensor input and send out SMS messages. Unfortunately, we had a lot of trouble setting up the board. Despite hours of troubleshooting, we could not flash code onto the board. In the end, we decided to work with an Arduino instead. We were able to restructure code and upload code onto this microcontroller which solved our previous issue.

 Common cutting-edge interactive services often use a one-size-fits-all model of language complexity to reach a base with varying levels of English proficiency. If we instead allowed chat-based programs to vary their behavior based on the proficiency of the user, it would better adapt to the needs of those most disadvantaged without hindering proficient speakers. This system could also be used in language education to improve with the user over time.

 Our inspiration for doing this project is that all of us have read the news about the natural disasters happening in our country such as Hurricane Harvey, the ongoing wildfires in California, and the recent tornados in the Dallas area. We are inspired to find a way to help people in need during these natural disasters. We believe with our idea, people will be able to get help quicker and to get help they otherwise might not have been able to get at all during times of distress. 
 World climate/temperature prediction suffers several pains. The past data is limited, influencial human events are unpredictable (ed. industrial revolution), and landscape can have huge impact on the model.etc. We can take care of those factors by very careful observation at different locations and make different prediction models which often produce different result ---- of which only one can be correct. Therefore, we believe an AI model will be better for making the prediction.An accurate climate/temperature prediction can be helpful to agriculture, ecology studies, and many other aspects. 
 We were inspired by the catastrophes we have learned about like the Palm Sunday and Andover tornado disasters that wiped out large parts of communities in an instant.

 The initial inspiration for our project was found while we were brainstorming in a meeting in our extracurricular activity, SPACE, at Dawson College. When we pitched our idea, SPACE sponsored us for the McGill hackathon for the entry fee as well as the Arduino boards and components that we needed. Finally, we were provided mentorship that greatly helped us enable this project. For the idea itself, it started when we played around with various Arduino sensors. We were also curious about thermodynamics because three of us haven't done anything advanced in this field yet, so we decided to try something and we would learn even if we fail.

 What inspired us the most during our stay here at WHACK, was the drive to push ourselves into doing a project outside our skill set . What we decided to do as a team was, find an issue in today's world we could make a difference in by creating something in the allotted 32 hours. It was then that our idea sparked. A device that could track the safety of your child and alert you of possible harmful or dangerous situations your child may face while you're away from them, thus creation a sense of relief for said parent/parents. Most importantly increasing the safety of young children and newly born infants. 
 We wanted to make a .io style game (think agar.io). At first we couldn't think of any ideas but then we spotted a wheeled trash can across the venue and we knew that we wanted to make a game where you push trash cans into other people to kill them. 
  
 Datasets for machine learning like ImageNet have created so much value and are an incredibly important part of the future. However, barely anyone can help label them. With over a thousand classes, even excluding the prevalence of very specific nouns and species of animals like birds, the task of knowing every class in such a large dataset is incredibly hard. We wanted to improve this and allow anyone to help researchers and companies label datasets while making a little money in the process.  
 A while ago a friend told me how much fun he had building a GameBoy emulator. I see why now. I was inspired to make something that I found interesting, and a lot of the work closely mirrored the ISA material I was learning in Computer Architecture. 
 Zack and I we're talking to the various sponsors at the event and were already sold on building a game. When we heard about Home Depot's challenge, we felt it left us enough creative room to create a memorable experience.  
 We wanted to use the tools provided to create a tool to make it easier for people to find volunteer opportunities, neighbors in need, and a fun bot to chat with as an interface.  
 One of our team members is from India and is aware of the struggles that those of rural India face. Based on his observations, and some research we learned that a large portion of the global population does not have documented medical history. This means that when seeking medical treatment providers may be unaware of things like medical conditions, allergies to medicine, and previous medical history. Our goal is to create an inexpensive, scalable system to allow access to medical records for all. By carrying a card (for example a government issued ID) with all this information attached it would speed up hospital wait times, ensure proper care, and expand the total population with documented medical records.  
 In emergency situations emergency services are often inundated with calls or they themselves are not in a position to help those in immediate need of rescue 
  
 My team and I have found that recently we have not been able to keep up with the latest scores, news, releases and all other interests of ours; We wanted to develop an all-in-one experience to users in an environment that is used daily: a mirror.  
 We come from Odisha, a coastal state in India affected by cyclones every year. We also hail from a country (India) where we experience a continuous array of disasters distributed across the topography (Flood in some parts, earthquakes in others) and the effect of such calamities is devastating. Considering cyclones, the Super Cyclone (1999) and Fani (2019) were the most notable ones where airspeed went up to 160 mph after landfall.The cyclone’s eye passing through the place is quite terrifying but even more catastrophic is the aftermath.People can’t find their relatives, their pets, cattle, their loved ones.Disaster Relief Team searches frantically in every part of the city requiring a lot of time, resources and manpower but still, there are places where a relief team can’t reach.That’s where we want to help, covering those inaccessible areas using an eye which is similar to a human rescuer’s eye. 
 Aharonov-Bohm effect shows that the magnetic vector potential A can have an impact on electron dynamics even though the magnetic field is zero. Aharonov-Bohm effect is a quantum phenomena describing the phase shift between two paths travelled by the electron. This phase shift, caused by the magnetic vector potential, implies constructive or destructive interference when the two paths recombine.To simulate this effect, run the script "Schrodinger_prop.py". The Schrodinger equation is solved in 1D under the condition of a defined magnetic vector potential. We tried to represent the wavepacket in 2D to illustrate the paths taken by the electron. 
 We wanted to utilize the power of near field communication technologies in this project. To do this, we used NFC card to scan and process data in the card.How we built itAt first, we attempted to create an Alexa skill and implement the Flutter project with Firebase, however, after many issues we decided to go server-less.Built Withamazon-alexaandroidfirebaseflutteriosnfcTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    HackTX 2019    Created by  I worked on the firebase and flutter mobile applicationYonathan Zetune"You are not the Techlead" -TechleadI was developing an alexa skill to alert users to actual disasters.Kushal ShahWorked on Alexa skill and integrationszabir031200 
  
  
 -- Developers and hobbiests all over the globe enjoy programming in a very diverse set of languages. While this diversity encourages a wide range of specialty skillsets, one of the largest issues plaguing the collaboration of programmers is the inability to easily translate code from one language to another. Our project, Transc<>de, attempts to mitigate this issue by supporting the translation of many primary features of today's top languages.Functionality-- Transc<>de supports a number of key use cases aimed at improving the understanding and learning process for all individuals interested in language translation:Clean and simple interface for developers to view their own code displayed in languages they may not be proficient inConvenient tool for viewing StackOverflow solutions to issues written in a language different from the desired outputDemonstrates the semantics specific to each languageChallengesThe grammars for each language we support are unique, requiring our team to handle the very tedious task of converting to a language-agnostic form in order to be able to translate operation functionality.For Typescript and Python, variables are not required to have type declaration. Java, on the other hard, requires type declarations on variables. Our team was faced with the challenge of writing a basic type inference system in order to appropriately handle this translation case.Becomeing familiar with the ANTLR frameworkWhat We LearnedProper language interpretation functionality perfromed by the compilerANTLR Framework structure and implementationHow languages are represented, and how these representations relate to a given parse treePotential GrowthOur primary vision for the usefulness of this tool would be extended with the construction of a Chrome Extension aimed at converting StackOverflow code into your current language directly in-browserA second interesting use case would come in the form of constructing a command-line interface tool which allows developers in larger tech stacks to convert between frontend and backend code seamlessly.A third performance-focused enhancement we would like to implement focuses on assisting  developers with optimization within a language's best practices. Developers would learn the best way to construct idiomatic and performant code while following proper standards of development. For example, in the conversion between a "for" loop in Python into "for of" instead of the slower "for each" loop.Built Withangular.jsantlrflare-2dimensionsmaterialuitypescriptTry it outtranscode.tech      Submitted to    HackPSU Fall 2019    Created by  Contributed to our language-agnostic tree standard and implemented the TypeScript support for the antlr and language-agnostic tree visitors.Dhruv SringariCreated the framework to support converting between languages, provided most of the Java support, and built the web interface.Noah RubinWorked on interpreting the Python Grammar and providing the support for Python language recognition, and conversion using parse tree visitors pattern via antlrhvl5451Designed frame-built code-translation animations using Flare by 2Dimensions, and synthesized online presentation via Devpost.Nick Alico 
 We were inspired to make this project by knowing from experience how difficult it is to make a presentation, especially when you do not have a parent or anyone else watching to gives critiques. With this application, one can prepare for a presentation without the help of a parent or anyone else watching. This makes it easy to find exactly where one messes up on a presentation as well as ways to fix these issues. 
  
 As we are all students deep into the recruiting process, we have all had our fair share interviews. We know that preparing for an interview can be a nerve-racking experience, so we wanted to give people an easy way to improve their speaking skills when answering interview questions. 
  
 Several loved ones of ours as well as of people we know have been in situations where they needed immediate care but had difficulty getting it for a variety of reasons: they had trouble finding the nearest hospitals, the hospital had a lack of certain specialists, etc. We wanted to create an app that could address this situation and provide support for users so that they could get help as quickly as possible. 
 I believe that lots of people would be like me who hate to wait in  line and nothing. However, there are lots of circumstances that people must physically be in line. For example, student need to wait in lines for office hours, and people in HACKTX need to wait in line to get free T-shirt. It won’t be a big problem if the line is quick but otherwise it would be a big deal. So we want to create a solution that free people from any kinds of physically waiting in line. 
 With talks of misinformation in the news constantly, we thought it would be beneficial to create a simple online service that can serve as the first line of defense against the spread of fake news. 
 Our team was looking for a web application that could benefit the world and be a cause of social good. We knew that there are many Americans who "declutter" and clear away items that they no longer need by throwing them away, despite many of those items being recyclable. Simultaneously, there are many low-income or homeless Americans who can not find the items that they require through interpersonal means and can not use sites like Depop or Craiglist because they require a credit card or a purchase of some sort. This is where out idea for a free item swap application arose.What It DoesSwap Tomorrow creates an easy, free, and seamless route to donation, item swapping, or item retrieval. After signing up and creating a free account, users can choose to either create a new listing for items that they wish to give away or donate to others, or create a listing request to ask for an item to be donated by a user who many have the item already. You can also search through listings to find the listing  that you may need. How We Built ItWe built the project using the Ruby on Rails framework along with front-end design languages such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. We deployed with AWS and Heroku.Challenges I Ran IntoInitially, we had  some trouble narrowing down the idea and niche we wanted to pursue. Social Good is a very broad topic, but our mentors helped us pinpoint a demographic or cause to pursue. A technical issue we faced was deciding on a single back-end framework to use and build the app in. Our team had different backgrounds, including Node.js and Ruby on Rails, but we decided to use Rails, a simpler development framework. Workflow within a team of 3 coders was also a new struggle; commits and deploys had to be planned and handled.Accomplishments That We're Proud OfAn accomplishment we're most proud of is the development of a simple idea into a potential long-term project that may socially benefit many communities within the country. The world is need of a free donation program that is  accessible through the Internet, as our world is changing very rapidly and we must accommodate those who can not traverse traditional donation routes.What I LearnedWe learned a lot about workflow, back-end development frameworks, and a LOT about Amazon Web Services from a helpful WHACK mentor.What's Next for Swap TomorrowSwap Tomorrow could reach new heights once we implement advanced technical features such as automatic location services so that a user's homepage items could only show those items that are within their location radius, web/phone connectivity that will allow users to use ST on both the web and on their iOS/Android phones (many low-income Americans own a mobile phone and use that, not a desktop computer, as their primary web access), and a "Quick List" function that allows users to create listing by taking a picture of an object that automatically becomes uploaded to the database.Built Withamazon-web-servicesherokujavascriptrubyruby-on-railsTry it outwhack2019.herokuapp.com      Submitted to    WHACK Fall 2019    Created by  I worked on the front-end.

 We are both avid esports fans, and the League of Legends world championship is happening now! This inspired us to create Clip It, a tool that can programmatically create highlight reels of Twitch streams in a matter of seconds. 
 We wanted to challenge ourselves. We wanted to build a platform for low-income students who missed the buses in the morning and need to arrive to school. We also want to provide the same services to the same students who might miss the bus after school (due to extracurriculars, office hours, etc.) and have no way to get home but to walk, and at times rather long distances. Some students on the team had similar experiences, and we really wanted to find a way to provide transportation services to these students and lessen the burden on their mental and physical stress. 
 Right now, investing takes places with very few metrics. On top of this, all of these metrics focus on economics. While this may seem normal, it doesn't allow people to invest in what they care about - support social issues, reject child labor, stop large scale direct and indirect pollution, all through investing. 
 167 countries have at least one law on the books that restricts women’s economic opportunity. Women still need their husband’s permission to get a job in 18 countries. Women are prevented from working the same night hours as men in 29 countries, including India, which prohibits them from working in factories between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. link to report pdfEven in a mostly developed country like the US, a bank or a credit union can close your account without cause. And minorities are statistically given worse rates. In China, this discrimination can be implemented on a much more granular lever, with your social credit score getting dinged if you happen to buy the wrong thing (like a book on witchcraft or a Practical Magic box set).We thought if DAO's like Moloch and MetaCartel DAO's can be used to pool funds and direct them to grants, why not create a Moloch like structure where deposits earn interest, and the membership can loan it out.

 We realized that investing is not a common practice among the younger generation. Therefore, we are inspired to help them take their first step into investment.  
 We actually found this idea on a Reddit post when we were looking for inspiration, and we both liked the idea right away, because it helps solve a pretty significant problem that currently seems to be overlooked by technology. When we researched how search parties are normally conducted, we found that essentially different people are assigned to different parts of a map, and we thought technology could definitely improve that process. Plus, if that's true, we hope it could make a serious impact on people's lives. 
 I wanted to try one of Centene's persona challenges and I thought it was the perfect time to learn how to make an iOS app since I only worked with Android before. 
  
 Millions of people face anxiety daily when dealing with regular social interactions. Especially in today’s tech-driven society, social interaction has been at an all-time low, due to the increasing importance of screen interactions. However, it's difficult and time-consuming to overcome anxiety with current conventional practices. Furthermore, there currently aren't any defined and effective ways to practice social interaction. Confidant aims to change that: we'll bring confidence into your social interactions, while being efficient, convenient, and painless. 
  
 People don't really know what they need in order to be prepared, so an itemized list of things they need could be incredibly helpful. 
 Mental health is a serious issue at my university. In 2017, Columbia University saw 7 deaths in its undergraduate body. According to Alice Hu from the Columbia Spectator, from 2007 to 2017, "Columbia had an undergraduate suicide rate of 11 students out of every 100,000 compared to a national average of 6.6 to 7.5." In my personal experience, the death of an acquaintance in my year in 2018 affected me at an alarming level. Ever since then, I've wanted to dedicate myself to building technology that does social good, especially in helping those facing depression and mental health struggles.Therapose is a last resort solution to prevent the worst scenario. When a student needs immediate mental health attention, she can choose one of a few broad categories, and be matched appropriately to a professional. My hope for this project was to provide a last case prevention for the loss of young adults who I interact with everyday, and those I don't. FeaturesTherapose features the authentication design pattern by implementing BCrypt to store password digests and session tokens to remember user login, resulting in a seamless first user experience. Therapose also allows patients to filter therapists by their expertise by using a dropdown menu to trigger a custom fetch therapists API, enabling patients to get the right kind of help easily. (gif attached)This app leverages ActionCables and WebRTC API to stream data between local and remote video channels, resulting in a stable video chat where the therapist and patient can communicate calmly. (photo attached)Finally, the app is capable of CRUD processes for requesting video chats with therapists. Therapists are able receive and view all of their video chat requests from patients. Requests are automatically deleted when the video chat is finished. This was accomplished using redux reducers (code snippet attached).What's next for TheraposeIn the future, I would like to build a text chat service between the patient and therapist using ActionCable. As of now, patients can request video chats and include a description of their issue to available therapists. Their page is dynamically re-rendered when the therapist accepts. However, a video chat would improve the process of communicating availability and reduce the stress already experienced so much by the patient.Built Withjavascriptpostgresqlreactreduxrubyruby-on-railsTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    WHACK Fall 2019Winner                JPM Challenge: Best Hack for Social Good                  Created by  Peter Choi

 We wanted to create an application that would hugely benefit and rebuild communities. We decided to focus on helping communities struck by natural disaster by having a user base of volunteers and organizations/relief centers that work together to efficiently provide services and resources to the people in need.

 Mass shootings are one of the biggest domestic crises faced by America. According to CNN in the last 10 years alone, there have been 180 school shootings totaling over 350 victims; and according to a study conducted by the University of Albany the average police response time to a mass shooting event is 6 minutes longer than the average duration of mass shootings. Meaning that in most mass shootings police response is effectively useless in saving lives and neutralizing any threats. Our Inspiration for this project was to lower the response time of emergency services, thereby helping to increase the effectiveness first responders can have on active shooter situations.   
 Usability testing is expensive and inaccessible, so we aim to replace large testing labs with AI. 
 Natural DisasterWith approximately 9624 people dying on average due to Earthquakes and Tsunamis being  almost twenty times more deadly than ground movements, it was flagrant for our team that this was a problem we wanted to help solve with the few hours we had. We wanted to see how we could collaborate to create an app in order to calm civilians and provide them reliable options during these devastating situations. As a result we even studied color psychology to create the least stressful situation for our users.   
 One of the most common issues among drivers of electric cars is not knowing where the nearest charging stations are without having to take their eyes off the road to search for themselves. In rural areas, finding the nearest charging station can be very difficult, and may put off potential electric vehicle (EV) owners. In order to solve this problem, we decided to create a utility to help users find and map the closest EV charging station dynamically, based on the charge of the EV and projected route. If we can solve this commonplace issue among prospective buyers, we can encourage more people to buy EVs, thereby reducing global emissions and improving the carbon footprint on the environment. 
  
  
 In a natural disaster situation, infrastructure may become unavailable. This can make it difficult to find where people are, or gather information about their condition. We built a system that securely sends encrypted information with no viewable meta data about the population over a peer to peer connection. Once one peer is able to come online, the data may be extracted or posted to a central server where it can be analyzed to more appropriately distribute aid.

 As an international student myself. It happens to me a lot that whenever I want to contact my parents, I always have to look up on my phone for their local time because of different time zones.For example, my parents live in Europe and my friends live in China. So, whenever I want to call them, I always have to remember time zones or search on the internet.

 As undergraduates at RPI, almost every member of our team found that it has been difficult to find tutors for upper-level classes.  We know that there is a high demand for tutors among students on campus, and there are likely many qualified tutors for upper-level courses.  We wanted a way to help students find tutors for more difficult classes and help potential tutors be aware of opportunities.

 The reason that we wanted to build this website was for two reasons. First of all, we wanted to help with the business of farmers to help them maximize their profits by looking at the various factors that they take into account when they have to do farming. Farmers will now be able to see all this information at once, and they will not have to worry about looking at other websites or apps. Second of all, we wanted to tackle a bigger problem about food overproduction. Food overproduction is not only bad for the profit for farmers, but it is also bad for the environment. By giving this model, we give farmers a plan of what goods they should produce so that they will not go with the problem of overproducing food by a lot. This will help save valuable resources in our world by keeping food overproduction under control. That was our story of why we wanted to create this website.
