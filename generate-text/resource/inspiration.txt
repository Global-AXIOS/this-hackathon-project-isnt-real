 We wanted to make a star sign quiz with a twist ending, and that evolved into a cat quiz. AR Player An interest in mathematics and significant sequences within it that are found in everyday life  Ethan noticed that the hardware lab had Leap Motion controllers on tap, and wanted to take advantage of that resource while it was available. While his initial idea, a real time particle-based fluid simulation that could be manipulated using the kit, fell through when we realized that it would take a lot more learning than we could do in a weekend, we still wanted to try out the Leap Motion kit, so we created Digitalis, Latin for "_ having finger-like qualities _", as a way of demoing the interactions possible between the Leap Motion software kit and the Godot game engine tools.

While it is difficult to combat deforestation when it is done legally, to clear farmland, or in service of large capitalist enterprises, we can try to stop illegal deforestation. We can surveil the forests and catch deforestation faster. This should make the capture and punishment of the perpetrators easier, which in the long run, should disincentivize the felling of these precious natural resources.
