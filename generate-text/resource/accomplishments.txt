 Getting this working! We spent 25 good working hours on executing on our plan. We are very excited to have WebSockets working right, because it's something we didn't have experience with before this Hackathon. 
 We're really proud of the iOS application and RESTful API we created for this project. Since all of us are freshmen, none of us had prior experience with technologies for creating custom APIs for our data as well as integrating this into an iOS application. Being able to create a platform based on a concept that we are all really passionate about makes us incredibly happy. We're happy that we learned new technologies and stepped out of our comfort zone, all while coding for good. 
  
  
  
 The accomplishment we are most proud of after this event is learning how to use and implement APIs. 
 Clean design and significantly improved user experience 
 A problem worth solving as at the times of calamity, in a chaos, even the best of response teams are bound to human error in panic. A smart system like ours will be working hand-in-hand to aid the response teams for better decisions.Help reached to a victim at right time can save their life. We are sure it's priceless. 
 We came up with creative solutions such as using multiple parents and child system to overcome the limitation on rotation and transform. We dynamically changed the material code and selective shader code to achieve desire "buffer" effect while retaining assets' original features. We also achieved accurate animation with Unity APIs.

 We built a clean, functional android app and implemented a Google Cloud API with it. 
 We're proud of how flexible we were, originally going from Google Cloud then transitioning to the more basic Python back end. It was also most of ours first time using Angular, which really pushed ourselves to understand the flow of data as we tried to pass data from component to component. 
 We successfully scraped the web for certification data of thousands of companies using API's. We also created our first chrome extension.  
 We were successful in making a prototype machine learning model. This was challenging because training takes a lot of time and understanding what models are actually doing with the training data is difficult. Accessing Android keyboard strokes was a genuine hack; this is a feature that not many apps are capable of integrating. The backend has all the functionalities needed to comprehensively link together a wide variety of services, like input devices, databases, and machine learning models, all on different platforms. 
 Royce essentially creating an AR web app library from scratch was a huge accomplishment along with the HTML templates for creating panels. 
 Website looks nice. We made a nice CSS gradient fill for the background 
 We connected successfully the transaction system. Also, the price datas and growth rates are actual real data taken from Kraken API which allow us to check crypto currency markets live.

 We are all very proud of all that we have learned. Most of our team had never used React or any cloud computing service. As simple as it may seem, integrating the front end and the backend together was a great accomplishment because we were able to establish an MVP and also see all of our individual work come together into something awesome!  We really took a deep dive into Azure, and I think that paid off in helping me better work with cloud services. 
  
  
 Points of pride on this project include having created nearly all of the models from scratch, texturing them ourselves, and having implemented a range of the quests features (including controller tracking and UI elements).

 We are proud that we learned a lot about AR. It was so much fun learning Apple's ARKit. The first time we tested the image recognition on the water bottle it took 1500ms to recognize and for some angles it wouldn't recognize at all. Eventually we figured out how to optimize the model of the object, so that the app would have the maximum amount of reference points. This lead to a significant improvement on the recognition for the water bottle. All of this allowed us to detect the battery of the car in under 100ms.

 The final result we obtain is satisfactory considering the timeframe we had to make it work and  the fact that no one was familiar with the equations used before this hackathon.  Although it diverges, the physical behaviour is what is expected given the moon positions. The external gravitationnal potential formulation is very general and robust, could potentially be re-used at a later date.  The plots are very beautiful.

Some major accomplishments include setting up the server, making the bot quote and respond to tweets, and the bot be able to recognize plastic vs non-plastic bottles. 
 We have a working system, that seems feasible. The RFID readers that hospitals would need to purchase only cost around $60 (INR 4300). The RFID tags cost only $0.10 (INR 7). These costs could be greatly reduced by buying the tags in bulk and using integrated PCBs for the hospital scanners. Currently a government issued Indian ID costs $0.70, so a $0.10 increase appears practical.

 We were able to write a program that can learn with data, figured out fire base, and the fact that we are a team of a with four different types of majors. 
  
 Everything our team has done together.  
 We're really proud to have made a working application with only two people -- and really only one developer. We both enjoy working on problems that will make an impact on people's lives, so we're really happy to have at least worked towards making an application that can potentially do that. 
 I'm glad that I was able to create parts of the app, even though it still needs a lot of work, but it's a good start! 
  
 We were able to establish a pipeline to convert raw user eye movement information and voice into meaningful data and voice response by using multiple Microsoft Azure services and our custom backend API.We're able to give users a comprehensive score that's able to judge their anxiety levels and empathy levels. In the future, we're easily able to extend this to more interpersonal metrics.What's next for ConfidantConfidant addresses pervasive issues with technologies that have far-reaching potential to make people's lives better by giving them confidence.In the future, we plan to integrate unconscious bias detection and training by allowing users to train on a diverse set of conversation companions (differing in skin color, gender, and age). We believe that respect for all people and equal treatment is a key aspect of a progressive society; Confidant is a significant facilitator to make that happen.Built Withazurecssflaskhtmljavascriptjquerypythonreact      Submitted to    HackTX 2019    Created by  Worked on the WebGazer eye-tracking library to calculate the user's eye-contact metrics, the calibration implementation for eyes, and the front-end layout of the user recording and response pageRithvik SaravananI connected all the components in a massive multi-server pipeline, with resources streaming from the client browser, to a Flask Server, to a tensorflow executable to multiple API calls. I also setup the generative 3d modelling from an academic paper, and made it render quickly so that it could be viewed in the browser. Jack RoperI used the Microsoft Azure api  to convert from text to speech and back.  I also worked on natural language processing, and computing the similarity between sentences.  I also did some of the html/css for the UI.Amit JoshiI created the Flask-based backend and implemented our backend platform on Azure VM. Furthermore, I helped integrate Azure's speech recognition service with our speech to animation pipeline in the backend.Jeffrey WangUT22 | Programmer, Entrepreneur, Creator, Thinker 
  
 We used ML successfully for the first time in a hackathon project. 
  
 Completed my very first hackathon projects!!! 
  
 We are just proud that we finished our app! A good portion of our team are first time hackers. 
 Shelby was really proud of the MongoDB and being able to successfully make that work in his project. He's walking out with tons of new knowledge that he will use in the future. Sam explored React and TypeScript and he is proud of what he has done and will be using this framework in the future. Amy was proud of pushing out 5 different designs while on little sleep and at 5 AM. She proved that she was able to push through. This was Anne's first hackathon and she learned a lot about them and how to manage her time. 
 We are proud of our learning experience of how to use APIs. 
 1) The product actually somewhat works 
 The machine learning reached an accuracy rating of 85%. 
 Getting informative data about the user testing the site and being able to analyze it with Azure APIs. We learned what Azure was, and how to interface with it in Python.Domain.com Challenge: AccordingToAllKnownLawsOfAviationThereIsNoWayABeeShouldBeAbleToFlyTo.SpaceBuilt Withazurecosmosdbkivynode.jspythonreactselenium      Submitted to    HackTX 2019    Created by  I worked on the desktop application UI (kivy) & browser tracking (selenium)Ben TaylorProbably somewhere playing electric ukuleleConfigured the Azure APIs and used Python SDK's to integrate them into the desktop appManasi RamadurgumI worked on the administrative UI.mcjcloud 
 We are really proud to get our Firebase powered communication channel. We are proud of our data fetching algorithms to present in a beautiful front-end UI for users to be informed about.  
 When designing our application, we struggled to find a happy medium between functionality and simplicity. After much deliberation, we took a step back and took into account the user’s interactions/experience and decided to incorporate Google Maps API to be used concurrently with our application to provide a seamless interaction of our app and Google Maps. The user is able to get the information they need without the holdback of having to search for themselves. 
  
  
 The potential to help victims of natural disasters.Implemented a lot in a short amount of time.Fleshed out idea -- we thought about and discussed a lot of ways to build off of this MVP.Proof of concept for mobile device Bluetooth communication. 
  
  
  
 We work out a time schedule for the person we want to call very specifically. We take consideration whether it is weekdays or weekend and even when "they're on their way to work" or "they're on their way home". We deal with tons of if statements and match the time schedule we designed into each time range of what they're doing and what decision should the caller  make thoroughly. We never used Uipath to build project, but now we build a project in less than 24 hours. 
 Completing this project 
 a working web app 
  
  
  
  
  
  
 we learned android studio  
 Though we were not able to create a working prototype, we are proud of the progress of being able to set up a database to initialize a login system and a working landing page.  
 Finish the project in time and generating interesting fonts 
  
 Fixing that bug. 
 The great sound effects 
 The game runs smoothy and looks aesthetically-appealing to the user. 
 At least have a UI done 
 We can record availability and time. Also, we have really cool navigation bar on the bottom of the screen. 
 Getting the machine to move places 
 The idea and the work we've done for it. We made great progress considering python wasn't our strong suit, and even though we did not fully complete the project I think we did a great job. 
 The user drawn input is displayed similarly to a fountain pen.  
 We were able to use an API to create the website, and present data well.
