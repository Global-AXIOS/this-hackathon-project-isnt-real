Optimized efficiency and quality formatting     Getting it done and our teamwork.  Getting python and HTML to communicate  This was a large endeavor, thus the completion of everything we originally outlined is something to take pride in. We also worked well as a team, having moved efficiently to accomplish everything while having fun doing it. And we also managed an appropriate amount of sleep. ITS FUN.Built Witharparticle      Submitted to    Abbey Road Hack-Power Of Immersion  9/10 Nov    Created by  Raffael Wulff  Our projects introduces several new approaches and perspectives. Our GPS and Wifi work to send emails, to any email address. Instead of merely setting a decibel threshold, our code for our microphone, analyzes for how long the abnormal decibel levels are happening, and our threshold is a range set by listening to many chainsaws, and looking at the patterns they made on the Serial Plotter graph. We built a website and we did not know anything about building websites beforehand We are proud of the visuals and to help fellow MoHos    Originally we had all planned to not present our project at the end of the Hackathon, but after how much we had accomplished and how proud we were considering we learned everything in one night, we decided we stay and show others what we had made. Built Witharduinoc      Submitted to    HackHolyoke 2019    Created by  I worked mostly with configuring the neoPixel  light sequences and wiringCaroline KnoteI worked with designing the light sensor and the success/fail logic of the game. It was my first time using Arduino, which was tough to learn, but really rewarding to see my work come to life. Rose SheehanSophie Vincent We are a very multidisciplinary team. We are majors in psychology, biology, art studio, and computer science. We are extremely proud to be able to come together and think of a product that would positively impact the mental health of children and their future. Although we did not get to achieve all our goals, we are proud that we could create a prototype in the short amount of time together.  Our idea is thought-out well and relevant to the world.  Detecting facial landmarks from live video stream. Our team is proud of the fact that out of many interesting ideas that we brainstormed, we could work on something which has a direct impact on people's health globally, in a very short span of time. We as a team believe that working on challenging problems with powerful technology like artificial intelligence will dramatically help democratize healthcare to the hands of people.    We are proud that we were able to finally get the sound to function despite it not working as smoothly as we would like. We also are proud of our teamwork in a team of two with only one experienced in computer science!Built Withjava      Submitted to    HackHolyoke 2019    Created by  As someone with no computer science experience, this project was a great learning experience where I got to work on a project related to the my interest in arts and music. Anna MorrisMariah Papy   We are very proud of how the entire product came together in the end, despite us working in parallel with some setbacks along the way as we merged our code together. We believe that our idea has a lot of potential and we are excited to continue working on it beyond this Hackathon.  We got our Alexa to respond and talk to us. Since the developer console was so difficult to use, we are really proud of the fact that we managed to make it function consistently. We also made Alexa sing "Daisy Daisy" in a frustrated way, which was somewhat time consuming. We made a successful platform that could be expanded to many local emergency frequencies allowing more people around the country to keep informed on emergencies in realtime. Find an image from the user files We were able to convert images to string and then do string to speech. This was a hard process as we didn't use any hardware.   We came up with an idea and was able to break it down into different parts of the problem to work on. We are especially proud of that each member was able to contribute and use their strength in either music, drawing, video-making, photoshopping, or programming. Communication was the key to our teamwork. We managed to work towards the same goal from different angles. Overall, our different backgrounds and specialties complemented each other very well. Nothing   Built human-like voice assistant with better user experienceCreated potential benefits to students and their communitiesLearned research statistics related to mental health and how technology can help  We are proud of ourselves because we never give up reaching the goal!We are proud of ourselves finally solving and conquering all challenges!We are proud of ourselves successfully designing the complete program structure!And of course, we are proud that the program can successfully run! Putting together a beautiful prototype and coining a new idea.  WIP  Having a solution for more problems with advantages features ......saving environment and public health.  test     our achievement until now           Building the application by myself and learning Blockstack and React with no prior experience.   a Organize and analyze three datasets with 20+ explanatory variables focusing on the energy usage at Mount Holyoke College in recent 10 years Source: myMountHolyoke.comDataset information1997 -2018 Annual Energy Use in BTUFY 2017-18 Recycling Report2010-2018 Water AnnualDesigned a questionnaire to understand a user’s personal habits and diet preference (the design methodology is based on two social theories Environmental Behavior Theory and Persuasive Theory) Provide an assessment score on the user’s engagement in carbon footprint reduction based on a self-designed Environmental Engagement Index (EEI) including 7 indicators Based on the aforementioned index (EEI), EcoCal calculates a user’s average amount of carbon footprint consumption and sets it as the base case (see details of algorithm design in Part III Implementation)For each user, EcoCal stores this user’s data over time,Recommend to user with daily nutritious diet plan which produces low carbon footprint based on our self-designed formula:  User Utility Multidimensional PredictionUUMP Formula: util(u, f) = wp ∗ pref(u, f) + wc ∗ carbon(u, f) +wh * health(u,f) Explanation: We define a user’s utility with three components: personal preference (based on the frequency of a food), nutrition, carbon footprint production EcoCal defines the optimal plan as the one with highest user utility Prioritized the diet recommendation that is easy for user to achieve a smooth transition from previous diet habits Allow user to invite friends to participate in online group challenge and games in order to expand our customer base through the network effect                    Our code is simple enough for everyone to use and easy to build on to complicate it more.       Have the idea who I think is a good skill to favourite a lot of things. This could be a library with a lot of random skills based on last used product, service.     I'm glad that with a simple idea, the project turned into a really useful program, here is an example of saving money.N branches x M employees x payroll x 12 months = total payroll expenses• It WAS 40 x 40 x 1000$ x 12 = 19 200 000 dollars per year• It BECAME 40 x 30 x 1000$ x 12 = 14 400 000 dollars per year• Benefit: 720 000 000 (decrease of payroll by ~ 25% )What's next for Cashier optimization system,that reduces client wating time.Built Withforecast.iooptimizationpythonrretai    Created by  Динислам Ораз  In 2 days of Hackathon we build a MVP and take the 1st place         With all the moving parts, this was probably the most complicated and in depth skill I've built. It's the first one I've built using Subscriptions as an ISP. After spending alot of time on the design, and considering cutting alot of the scope, I'm proud that I completed everything I set out to do, and that I designed it in an efficient and scalable way that requires little maintenance. I'm excited to see how it performs now that its out there in the wild!   Released a functional prototype within the limited time frame, despite challenges. This thing is live and works and almost looks not bad!  I'm proud of the fact that we were able to create a product that normally takes days to finish in only 24 hoursBuilt Withapitrackerbootstrapcssfilestackapijavascript      Submitted to    DeveloperWeek Austin 2019 Hackathon    Created by  Steve Nguyen Completing the landing page, implemented oauth, working in new stacks Overall, aside from programming factors, I think I created a decent variety of audio elements and immersive intro, questions, responses and outros.  Suspect profiling i.e. biodata, photos and exhibits chain of custody. Research made to liaise with other stakeholders.         It works. It takes pictures, zooms, you can change important settings. It even saves photos to the phone's camera roll.          We were able to find out how to use real-time face recognition API (OpenCV lib) and detect eye blinks and distance between the face and PC display.    The first position game using GPS as an Alexa skill in Japan.In addition, I think I'm proud because it's probably the world's first real mystery game using Alexa. I am proud of making the code as efficient as possible. There are no unnecessary objects or unneeded loops. In the future however, I would like the game completely by myself. Half of the project, the HangmanMain class, was given to me to make the game operate. I created the HangmanManager that mainly created the word patterns.          Evrything Implementation of multiple cases via a statemachine, and implementation of in-skill-purchasing.Also I am very proud of the complex murdermystery that was created.     The ability to create the digital portfolio that is user friendly, accessible, and responsive to all devices. The MOBI prototype.

Now I can put it on my laptop as a badge of honor.    After building the proto in remote conf call, also without having met the customer f2f, we always had a follow up and we got compliments from both colleagues and customers about the effectiveness of the demo and the power of Progress. I am proud to be part of it. Building a process template the demo have been replicated and delivered by other colleagues in similar cases. it works! ;-) Enabling training on demand.Quick deployment with QR codes. We were able to work upon such a nice platform - Red Hat developer studio. Deploying our application upon openshift was another part of our interest. Then we even made another project and will integrate it soon using Quarkus and Kafka extensions.   Couple times I was thinking that nobody will play it, I was considering switching to another ideas. So I'm glad that I've finished it.        As a group, we are proud of incorporating methods to link the pages together, allow editing for existing data, and being more proficient with HTML and CSS. We all learned the React Framework for the first time! We are all proud to have created this project, as the language and APIs were all learned on the fly.    We were able to find a public and secure location for the kiosks without compromising our mission to be discreet. We are proud that we were able to make a functioning web application that properly implements the google maps API and has an overlay of a polygon heat map from a dataset we got from the city of Salinas. Overall, putting everything together was difficult and we are all satisfied with the outcome we were able to produce. We managed to get a very simplified test model to work as supposed to the application we were aiming for.  Design-- Hannah did a wonderful job with this. The User persona process Later expanding our user base to high schoolers and those over the age of 13, and how it related to one of our team members. The gamification process Our team collaboration Beta Testing link via React Native     The frontend and back end connection    I'm happy that we have a program that runs and that we had fun making it. Everything that we got finished. Setting up and understanding the code base and beginning to interact with it.  We are proud of the layout of the website, and the thorough planning process that went into this website.  Despite some malfunctions, we built this website to connect easily with future features.  In addition, our XML parsing was very successful, and we found that enjoyable. I'm amazed that I was able to complete FloodGate over such a small duration, especially considering my lack of experience with Flask and Arduino. I faced many set-backs with the site interface, so ultimately having a working version of the site pushed into production was extremely fulfilling.  The AI actually scans the pictures and returns the resulting keywords and how likely they are true to the Java application after the scraped images are uploaded and processed. The software package gives everyone a tool to use during a natural disaster and for recovery.  We were proud of the Java and Javascript integration and learning many APIs in a short amount of time. We are proud of our prototype and the idea of our project because it benefits our group members as well as the city of San Francisco.  Able to trace a path of virtual crumbs for anyone to see.Able to see a note left in the path when is inside the camera view. We were very proud of being able to work so efficiently and cohesively even though most of us had never participated in a hackathon before.  Designing our app with a working live database that is also visually appealing for the user.  Cloud syncing, user interface We managed to assemble a working website with text notifications, data analysis, and a user database all in 24 hours!  We are proud of this entire project within itself, as we embarked on doing something none of us had previously had much experience prior to this Hackathon. We successfully linked most of our HTML pages to our python.     The clustering algorithm worked as intended. It can find ideal spots for camps.  Learning to do all the scraping and sticking together!  Our software “Mini Weather Forcast” can get the weather(including the temperature, wind scale) of different cities all over the world,  and can also give you the choice of what clothes you can choose to wear based on the current weather outside. Analyzing the data, and pick lastest 3 days as specific output(if rain turns red), and a bar graph showing the weather of lastest 7 days.AdvantageLight-weight-clothes-matching User-friendly: easy to operateGlobal Location and good accuracy     Getting this working! We spent 25 good working hours on executing on our plan. We are very excited to have WebSockets working right, because it's something we didn't have experience with before this Hackathon. We're really proud of the iOS application and RESTful API we created for this project. Since all of us are freshmen, none of us had prior experience with technologies for creating custom APIs for our data as well as integrating this into an iOS application. Being able to create a platform based on a concept that we are all really passionate about makes us incredibly happy. We're happy that we learned new technologies and stepped out of our comfort zone, all while coding for good.    The accomplishment we are most proud of after this event is learning how to use and implement APIs. Clean design and significantly improved user experience A problem worth solving as at the times of calamity, in a chaos, even the best of response teams are bound to human error in panic. A smart system like ours will be working hand-in-hand to aid the response teams for better decisions.Help reached to a victim at right time can save their life. We are sure it's priceless. We came up with creative solutions such as using multiple parents and child system to overcome the limitation on rotation and transform. We dynamically changed the material code and selective shader code to achieve desire "buffer" effect while retaining assets' original features. We also achieved accurate animation with Unity APIs.     I am proud of the idea, I think it is applicable in a variety of fields.  Web-App completed that serves the overall functionality and educational purposes. The accomplishments that we are proud of are the NoSQL database that is part of the Firebase database. We came creative, cute idea and had great execution.  We have successfully retrieved information from Google Classroom and uploaded it to Salesforce, which is the main goal of the NPO.  Even though we are currently having trouble linking our backend to our frontend, we are happy that the two individual pieces are able to functional by themselves.   Working with a new API and visual display library.  We are proud of facilitating a website that is already available for use by others for the purpose of enriching mental health and well-being.  Having made this product in a day with a website and google chrome extension deployed We acquired useful insights that are multifaceted. The impact is realized to be across industry and public use. Hence we consider our project to be of a greater usage through elastic consumption.  I am proud of getting through the challenge I faced and getting the project done alone.  The idea itself!  Solution to the pairing requirementBloom filter hashing algorithm   Piecing together a complicated project and getting it working. Building two Cosmos modules and an ORM!Testing out IBC and the DEX!Nice presentation of the whole idea here https://bit.ly/redaomint   Getting a MVP live in under 18 hours; I'm talking about from scratch only boilerplate was from create-react-app; Understanding and implementing the contract on Ride  Now, a user can register, modify and access their identities without having any physical hardcopy of the document.  Squink has the potential to undercut all existing services by 2-fold or more (10-fold if we consider Coinbase). We’re very proud of such a clearcut value proposition.What's next for SquinkWe would like to configure Squink to hold the bulk of its stablecoin assets in a reserve composed of interest-bearing form, such as cDAI or cUSDC. This would enable Squink to offer some combination of better returns for liquidity providers and even lower prices.

A good looking front end and a good idea we will improve apon. learning js on the fly, learning about crypto on the fly.  We were proud that even though we are handicapped by our programming skills, we were still able to produce a functioning prototype that looks good and works well.  Having something that works! Implementing flash loan functionality while connecting the front-end to the back-end and solidity functionality.

We have a solid design and framework for the project. We met each other. Learning and understanding Cosmos SDK and trying to port Compound on it in under 36 hours - and actually getting somewhere with is an achievement I am proud of!  We built a clean, functional android app and implemented a Google Cloud API with it. We're proud of how flexible we were, originally going from Google Cloud then transitioning to the more basic Python back end. It was also most of ours first time using Angular, which really pushed ourselves to understand the flow of data as we tried to pass data from component to component. We successfully scraped the web for certification data of thousands of companies using API's. We also created our first chrome extension.  We were successful in making a prototype machine learning model. This was challenging because training takes a lot of time and understanding what models are actually doing with the training data is difficult. Accessing Android keyboard strokes was a genuine hack; this is a feature that not many apps are capable of integrating. The backend has all the functionalities needed to comprehensively link together a wide variety of services, like input devices, databases, and machine learning models, all on different platforms. Royce essentially creating an AR web app library from scratch was a huge accomplishment along with the HTML templates for creating panels. Website looks nice. We made a nice CSS gradient fill for the background We connected successfully the transaction system. Also, the price datas and growth rates are actual real data taken from Kraken API which allow us to check crypto currency markets live. We're proud to provide an application that cares about the well-being of our home.What's next for Code For TreesIn general, we hope this brings awareness to maintaining Earth. We hope to continue working on the application and gain company sponsors.Built Withazurecssgojavajavascriptmaterialuimongodbrabbitmqreact      Submitted to    HackTX 2019Winner                PwC Sponsor Challenge                  Created by  I worked on the judge portion, which runs submissions and makes their output available.
