 We were able to finish up initial MVP version1 of Maasto-101. we were able to overcome the challenges of transmitting data over BLE using trial and error mechanism of various different BLE libraries, visualizing the data taken from 6-axis gyroscope and accelerometer onto a 3D Plotly graph.Maasto-101 version1 will be tested in real scenarios with upgraded toy car for a further reliability of the model.This gives us a boost and confidence to develop the version2 of Maasto-101 which involves high capacity Drone with data analysis on potholes captured.We hope that sharing those statistics with government will help them to improve the current street conditions and give a better living to the people around the region. Improvement in the street conditions will reduce the maintenance cost of goods supplier vehicles and frequent travelers.We are proud of ourselves that we were able to contribute to our society with this innovation and a very big Thanks!!! to Intel Technologies by conducting such a hackathon. This motivates geeks to keep innovating. Rock on Intel!!!.

 We are glad that the application made it through almost all the tests, from sending the request until having it accepted by a driver. The minimal bugs reported during the testing phase are to be fixed and patched in ChedliTaxi V2.What's next for ChedliTaxiActually, clients will fall in love with ChedliTaxi if there is a big number of drivers using it as well. The client would ideally use the application to find available taxis instantly. Therefore, the next phase is application marketing; we need to have as many drivers and clients using the application. Concerning the future of the application development, as mentioned previously, we will be accordingly releasing patches to bugs discovered by users.Built Withandroidandroid-studiogoogle-mapsjavamysqlphp      Submitted to    Ford Code for Taxicabs Mobility ChallengeWinner                Third Prize              Winner                Popular Choice                  Created by  I took care of coding the application after my teammate and I have made the software design together.

 This is the first complete app I have built using Firebase. After the Parse.com shutdown, I was forced to try several different databases but could not find a good option. After learning about Firebase, I decided to use it for my new app. However, being unfamiliar with JSON and its structure, I ran into some difficulties when organizing data. After a lot of self learning and troubleshooting, I was able to cleanly organize information in the database.  
 I loved the process of designing and coding the app.I have been teaching myself how to code for almost a year. I learned so much in such a short amount of time through tutorials and listening to friends who gave me advice.Challenges I ran intoThe most challenging part of the process, beyond the coding, was adding finishing touches to the app. I know that UX, user experience, is essential for someone not to delete your app minutes after downloading it. A few friends tested out the app in its early days while I watched to see how they interacted with the app. There were obvious things that made sense to me, but my "users" could not figure out. So, I took my observations and their feedback and went back to the _ storyboard. _

  We really involved into this project and challenge ourselves. In order to solve this complex problem, we not only investigate it from several aspects like transportation management, policy, chemical engineering, software and psychology, we also run through almosot the whole process of a product's develpment. For example, although we study chemical engineering, we tried to use the knowledge of fluid mechanics into solving this complicated traffic flow problem. We thing out of the box and solve the problem with Interdisciplinary cooperation. Most important of all, as a resident in Luodong, we can solve our own issues and help the society is a great honor!

Most solutions out there accomplish one of those two pillars but not both - and now we are the first to make it available in JIRA!We’re also proud of how we solved the key management problem. In Team Secrets, one of our business rules is that our servers can never have all the information necessary to decrypt a user’s file. This is to protect our users’ secrets even if our servers get compromised.

 We were very organized and nailed down the storyline at the start so that everyone can work in parallel together. This is very important as the The Scarlet Record consists of 8 chapters, which would be impossible to be achieved linearly.We ensured as far as possible that there were no productivity blockers for anyone (undecided art/assets, storyline choices) and aimed to resolve these as fast as possible, which is very relevant to software engineering in real life as development output often scales very poorly with the number of engineers. 223 commits as of time of writing - definitely productive!We managed to accomplish most of what we had envisioned for the story, and are very proud of that.

 Getting the most out of the Alohar API is something we are extremely proud of. Alohar provides us with insights on where a user's home location and work location could be. We use that data to extrapolate where the user is going. By taking into consideration several contextual nodes such as time of day, user's past transactions, direction user is heading, and other deliveries being done at that moment, we create optimal matches that saves buyers time and money. In the same way, we optimize routes for deliverers so that they can make the most money possible and complete several deliveries in one go.  What started out as a simple hack ended up providing convenience for people ordering on the go. The app is also a quick and efficient way for other student to make money without going out of their way. Our team is extremely proud of the fact that we can bring people together, empower them to earn, and provide this instant convenience at the tap of a button. We have placed a lot of attention on a seamless user experience. The way we integrated the Alohar API drives our real time, context-based deliveries. Compared to other conventional food delivery applications, we save time and money for the people who order. Likewise, we are extremely proud of nurturing a community where people can mutually benefit from helping one another. In many ways, we are reinventing the traditional supply chain of ordering and delivering. Thanks to Alohar, we were also able to build on existing user behavior rather than forcing users to change what they do and where they go everyday. We are proud of championing Fireflies as a seamless convenience that makes communities stronger.

 It is a very simple and clear way (vision guiding system) to solve the traffic jam problem in the tunnel. 這是一個非常單純且簡潔的方案(視覺導引)解決隧道內塞車的原因。The system can be built in tunnel directly, so it's compatible with all vehicles and drivers. No need to learn or update any equipment. 系統直接建構於隧道本身，設計與運作環境單純，不需要駕駛學習操作且通用於所有車輛。Provide sufficient messages to each car, minimize the factor of traffic jams. 針對個別車輛的問題給予個別指示，將塞車的可能因子降到最低程度。We have designed the software in C, and the control logic is able to be transplanted to larger real system in tunnel with little modification. 我們用C完成了軟體設計，控制邏輯僅需部分微調，是可以移植到真實的隧道系統中。 
 The largest accomplishment is of course completing this App.

 Combining multiple sources of data is never easy, but we accomplished a seamlessly integration of SharePoint -and Planner tasks. Deep dive into both API's gave us the opportunity to display the correct properties of the tasks with eventually the only difference between the two systems: the icon at front. 
 Actually managing to make it work was a challenge - especially when it came to data decoding. The data decoding automatically resynchronises the clock on high quality pulses, and then relies on this timing when the signal becomes worse in quality. Secondly, the system automatically keeps track of the high and low signal powers, and continually readjusts the thresholds to ensure that a drift in power still remains readable.  
 We consider this proof of concept successful and look forward to making it production ready.

 We are proud of the many of our features that we were able to create despite the time constraint and our lack of knowledge of the language when we started the app. One major example are the Pie Chart Apis on the compare pages. For these we learned how to program, format, as well as embed live API charts into a web viewer of the app that could take changing real time variables within the app and use them to compose the charts. As side from the sort function, the update page functioning was also an accomplishment. Since there is no given timer, we programmed the stopwatch on our own and created many split functions to make the app able to add to the time already existent on the app. We also were able to program the app to allow people to stop the timer, take breaks, and then start the timer again and still allow for the time to compile under the actual time of the same task.  
 We specially love the purr effect that you get when petting Purrpurino, as it reminds us of our cat. We are really proud of having created a working prototype of a toy that could be used to play, educate, and promote good behaviour on kids, but above all we are really proud of having created a toy that our test kids LOVED!  
  
 One of our big achievements is delivering our solution on two different platforms that can reach many users. We are very excited about our project and it's potential impact in assisting with saving many lives. We are also proud of how our users can interact with our solution in whatever language they are comfortable with. 
  
 -Accessing DeFi protocols through Zaps, costs less gas than individually transacting on each one to attain the same result. For example, going from ETH to cDai on Compound and ETH to dLETH2x on Fulcrum will end up costing you ~$5-$6 in transaction fees. Lender's Zap helps you acheive ETH to cDai + LONG2xBZX in a single transaction, for ~$0.86-$1.76. -Registering Lender Zap on ENS, now investing into Compound + Fulcrum is as easy as sending a deposit from your wallet to Lender.DefiZap.eth

 As a team, we overcame multiple challenges in order to produce a fully functional product. We were able to integrate both hardware and software into this project. On the hardware side, we implemented a total of six sensors: temperature, carbon dioxide concentration, total volatile organic compounds. We are very proud of connecting most sensors through the I2C protocol, making the product lighter and more portable. On the software side, we implemented real-time database using Google's FIrebase. By uploading real-time data collected from the sensors to the database and retrieving them to the web application, operators behind the screens will have an accurate picture of the fire scene. They will be able to make appropriate decisions to better exterminate the fire and possibly safe the lives of the firefighters.

 As an integration product, it was necessary to learn two separate APIs and product feature sets. New to Atlassian SDK and OSGI, we had to surmount several learning curves at once such as overcoming limited documentation and proprietary "nuances" to create a full-featured, enterprise-level product integration with the world's largest e-signature provider. 
 We're proud of each other for coming in clutch when the situation called for it, putting in the time to get the project completed, working through the frustrating problems and bugs that naturally arise in projects like this. Also, we challenged ourselves with this project, there is pride in knowing that we put ourselves outside of our own comfort zones for this project. 
 I'm proud of the level of integration accomplished. The button experience feels natural and being contextual is pretty darn useful. It's a testament to how well the Trello Power-Up API is built that I was able to integrate this deep.I'm also proud of the flexibility and power that the product offers. It's relatively easy to create single-function power-ups, but it's extremely hard to make something that allows so many combinations with a reasonably simple user interface.  I don't think there's anything like this in any other project management platform.

As the map size increases, we can observe that the time saved for each driver is increased. This shows that with the increase in map size that the real world scenario will have, the time saved will increase thus proving the efficiency of the modified algorithm and ensuring high performing automated cars.What's next for Modified Dijkstra algorithm for optimal navigationThe future work would be to build a prototype of the model and go over the safety features in the case of a failure with a fine comb and to build a real-time web version of it.Built Withc++      Submitted to    MHacks NanoWinner                All Submissions                  Created by  Mashrin SrivastavaSaumya SuvarnaGarima Gupta

 We are really proud of all the research and information we are able to provide through this game. We believe this information is all very valuable to the players and topics that are not discussed enough. Additionally, we were very successful in collaboration and each team member contributing equally. None of us have ever been on a team that worked so well together and had each member working to the best of their ability for the full twenty-four hours. We are very proud of our product and its potential! 
 If-Found-Lost is now a fully working product. Currently serving at if-found-lost.meteor.com. This is an idea that I had me for few months, So I am proud that I could finally implement it, and get support to run a possible innovative business with it in the future. 
  
  
 Leverage the most current information technology to reach the goals of maximizing car flow and removing the bottleneck of total capacity allowance. We did an Efficiency Assessment showing there’s 27.48% improvement on the car flow if passengers on regular cars switch to eCar solution and go on carpool lane(eCar and bus only) with the buses. 
  
 Its an amazing hack that worked and have lots of scopes for improvements. 
  
  
 It is a working prototype, it complies with coding standards on both the JIRA side as well as on native mobile app development side. 
  
  
 Hardware – we literally hacked hardware to make it bend to our whims and needs for this project. Our hardware wizard (Azra) spent an incredible amount of time working with microphones and signals Artificial Intelligence – we had very little experience with non–traditional neural network architectures, especially exotic ones like the double weaved biaxial recurrent neural network used by Hexahedria. This project enabled us to understand how small architectural changes in neural nets can produce gigantic differences on a network’s output. 
 We're proud of implementing all the stuff within the 24 hours, even we suffered several setbacks. We're happy that especially the hardware part was so well prepared that we could resolve the issues. We saw smoking electronic parts, but luckily they still work. And we really like the speed indicator. 
 The python script is extremely fast, and took relatively little code to write, given the fact that it can run almost any one line bash command.

 My "day job" is technical consulting, and although I've worked on and with software teams over the past eight years and write a bit of code here and there, I don't consider myself a developer. This was my most significant (by far) attempt at writing an app for commercial use, and I'm frankly extremely satisfied that I was able to complete it unassisted and create something of value. Regardless of the eventual popularity of the add-on in the Marketplace, at minimum I now have a viable solution to a problem that, until now, my clients have faced daily. I consider that to be an success by any measure. 
  
 Réussir à mener à terme le projet dans des conditions peu favorables; cela est très satisfaisant. 
 There are numerous accomplishments that validate our efforts and keep us moving forward: Recruiting incredible advisors: the Chief Innovation Officer of EMA, two managing directors of hospitals in Virginia, the CTO of an EHR-integration company, and numerous prominent healthcare investors.Building a fully-functioning prototype and building a community of clinicians eager to implement our productWinning $11,000 from a series of entrepreneurship competitions.Moving insanely fast - we work on Tandem 80+ hours a week each - we've gone from an idea to a fantastic product in record time and are now moving even faster to iterate our product through user testing in preparation for our committed summer pilot.

 Nick and I are both very happy with the final design of the rule builder.  It's incredibly simple, yet very powerful.  We've also added an in product on-boarding tour that should make it very easy for our users to get started with Automation for JIRA.On the technical side we are both proud of the React, Redux, AWS Lambda stack we've developed.  The front-end will make it easy to port this add-on to server in the future and the cloud back-end stack will be an incredibly cost-effective way to host this add-on. 
  
 We are super excited to be able to apply our learned academic skills in addition to those we just learned on the spot today for real life applications in the world's largest industry.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  We were able to take photo of the menu, and instantly crop out of the relevant text, doing a huge amount of OCR preprocessing with a click of the finger. Also, our OCR is near 100% accurate, and the image search result all came back super relevant.

 The app actually works and the idea was eventually implemented though nobody has been employed yet.A unit test was written (for the first time in history of hackathons).We are especially proud of the UI/UX - spent quite a while as we think this is important. 
  
  
 This solution reduces the human effort spent to a great extent. And I am proud to say, that Resources can be used for better work rather than just managing user access in SharePoint. No need to provide costly SharePoint training to the users who need basic functionalities. Removing unnecessary waiting for the data access (Why to wait for something that you are already authorized for) 
 At the end of the hackathon we had a working prototype of our app. We had some parts working in all areas of the application from the hardware IoT side to the Meteor server to the front end angular charting. We each overcame many difficulties to ensure this happened. 
 We are proud to have successfully integrate this onto the Flir SDK and to implement a prototype which functions as we intially desired - with more functions to follow in development. 
  
 We achieved an accuracy of 93.75% which is much greater than previous research! 
 I have wanted to build this for a while, but only found the time to do so last minute. So is quite please with the result given that the solution is built in less than a day.  
 Over the entire duration of our hackathon, we were proud of having addressed our integration issues in achieving an efficient flow of control across the program stack for seamless input and data transfer. We are also proud of having learnt, implemented and debugged an entire new language - Flask - over the course of just this hackathon since it was an integral part of our project. Moreover, we achieved seamless remote database hosting to form the backbone of our entire interface.  
  
  
 After 30 hrs of intensive work, we are finally able to build a complete collaborative platform where users can post their queries along with the images. We are also creating more engagement through AR and summarising the articles effectively. In addition to that we have integrated WILL SDK which brings the power of wacom digital ink in our product.

 Personally, I'm an out Australian expat rainbow Mum and professional activist living in Hong Kong. My wife flies as a Captain for Cathay Pacific. We travel a lot, especially for our youngest son's medical appointments (he has cochlear implants and is going blind). Being an out woman, being a mother, being an expat, being a traveller, being an activist, being a professional networker – I wear a lot of hats and I’ve become a member of a lot communities.I'm proud that I have been able to have a concept that has resonated and enabled me to gain support and commitments from some of my favourite and most influential global activists and thought leaders. Before the Hack4Equality came along Planet Ally was something I was talking about this idea but not acting upon it, truth be told I was overwhelmed as to how to even kick off!It's incredible in such a short space in time to have the support and the ear of VIPs like: Geena Rocero (Gender Proud) Matt Beard (All Out) , Lia Parifax (Arcus and Athlete Ally), Nigerian activist Bisi Alimi, LGBTI academic Lee Badgett, MTV Genderqueer star Jacob Tobia, Swedish activist and technologist Nadia Zabehi and to my shock and delight Indian Prince Manvendra to name a few. I'm turning 40 in a few weeks and I have been passionate about wanting to make Planet Ally happen, I just didn't know how. I planned and still do plan to use using my birthday as a 'hack for human capital'. I will be walking all my friends – mums, dads, athletes, artists, activists, allies, you name it – through this first iteration of Planet Ally to gain as much insight, feedback and inspiration as possible. Creating and curating Planet Ally is the next phase in my activist career.       Hack4Equality is the most spectacularly serendipitous opportunity and I just can not thank all involved enough for the gift it's given my team and I to really think what about our hopes, vision and next steps are for Planet Ally.I am also thrilled we have built a platform that other apps and technologies could plug into (including fellow hackathon entries e.g. #Hack4Equality Turn Out app for volunteers)

 I'm very proud that I have successfully trialled a medical device which I created at my kitchen table, and have found that it could help reduce the severity of gait freezing by such a vast percentage.I'm really proud, that against the odds, and people telling me that it would not be possible, I've kept making progress with the commercialisation of my device. I'm very proud that I have recieved the backing of my national medical device association, the IMDA, and that they believed in me and my abilities enough to invest in my personal development.I'm also really proud that developing my device now means, that I have, at my fingertips, the potential to help millions of people around the world suffering from Parkinson's disease. I think that it is really fantastic to be able to reach out and help others through technology, and I'm immensely proud of what I have achieved thus far. I'm really proud of getting into the outbox incubator, its something that I never thought would have been possible for me to achieve, and I'm just delighted.I was really proud to get the opportunity to present Free Feet to our national minister for health, and to learn that he was very impressed with it was fantastic, he said that he hopes to see it in use in the very near future.

 Because almost every emergency service call center in the US cannot receive text or non-audio information and home invasions are a real danger, we are proud that our app has the potential to save lives that might have otherwise been lost. I have never worked on an app before, and have mostly just worked in data science. Many of the components and steps in this project were completely new to me, but I didn't give up!What's next for RoboCopUsing a custom phone launcher, we hope to be able to add a "stealth call" feature that calls the police based off of a button click combination (ex.- power button clicked and then volume-up button clicked four times) so the service can be used without the use of a screen and while still in a person's pocket. This might be useful to those in situations where they need to call the police but cannot due to a person watching them such as during a mugging or a physically abusive relationship.Built Withandroidbluemixbootstrapcsshtml5ibm-watsoniosjavascriptphonegapsmartphonetwiliowindows-phone      Submitted to    HackUMassWinner                Communication Innovation Award              Winner                Finalist              Winner                Champion              Winner                IBM Bluemix Cloud Development Innovation Award                  Created by  Frontend, UX, presentation, etc..David NearyRhode Island and Massachusetts.

 Above all we're proud to have a wallet that is basically functional and hassle-free to set up. We are especially proud that we were able to create a more secure wallet than existing solutions like wallet.ethereum.org and Mist by applying a content security policy, loading the code in a client-side package (that will eventually be code-signed when it's released as part of Brave browser), and rendering the web app in a sandboxed context that is up-to-date with Chromium. We are also proud that the app doesn't require users to download any command-line tools or understand the inner workings of geth. We hope this will allow users of diverse backgrounds to get started with using secure hardware Ethereum wallets.Finally, as creators and users of Brave, we are super excited that Brave will have a builtin Ethereum wallet, hopefully making secure cryptocurrency management more accessible to folks who are already using Brave.

 We are very proud that our project is able to detect your fingers pressing the shapes drawn on the board, and we can play different sounds from different shapes. Also, we learned to use Figma and was able to create some amazing designs for our website. 
 Our workflow was very effective. Using Heroku, every commit to master immediately deployed on the server saving us a lot of time. In addition, we all managed the repo well and had few merge conflicts. We all used a shared database on AWS RDS which saved us a lot of database scheme migration nightmares.  
 We are proud of our ability to overcome all of the challenges that we ran into while developing FireNode, ranging from the difficult mathematics of trilateration to parsing the massive amount of data about the network. We are also proud of the low latency time between collecting our data and displaying it to the user, i.e. making our application truly real-time. 
  
 We believe this is both a legitimate use of blockchain technology (as the centralized version of this service would be hugely invasive for both patients and responders, and would present and extremely high-value target for malicious actors) and a good example of a use case that can only succeed on a permissioned chain as the geo-coordinates of an incapacitated victim could be easily exploited by malicious individuals for their own morbid gain if they were published on a publicly-accessible network.

 This is definitely the easiest and fastest way to write code for an AI bot and see immediate results (all within a browser!)Variables and state information persist even though the code gets recompiled at every keystroke!The server keeps track of every player's code and state in its own isolated container, separate from the global state.The live-coding-server logic is more or less decoupled, making it easy to repurpose for any other game or simulation for teaching purposes. (Imagine it being as easy as: import the plugin, define which function you want users you to be able to live-edit, and a code button pops up that allows users to play with the code in real time!)Despite how simple this game is, this would actually be pretty close to a real setting where you might implement AI because of the game state is continuous (not grid based). If we wanted to teach people about techniques such localization, we could omit sending the current player's position and have them use the common techniques to locate themselves on the map. 
  
 Having a robust AWS infrastructure that will support a growth in user base & will be ready to support multi-region data hosting with data security protected. We are also able to support zero downtime upgrades to the add-on in the Continuous Delivery approach.  Having only started development in May we are very proud of the features we have so far in the add-on. Reusing the same codebase of the frontend for both Server and Cloud versions, which will make the maintenance much easier.

 We are most proud of how far the project has come in such a short development time span. As we came to know about this Hackathon just 4 weeks before the deadline. Over the course of development, we thought of many great ideas that we would like to add to the application but were unable to implement due to time constraints. However, despite this, we have built out all of the core functionality and UI to serve a strong foundation going forward. 
 Greatest accomplishment would be being familiar with Azure's cognitive services that made it possible for me to interpret the user's need. Now I wouldn't hesitate to dive deeper into ML services Azure has.

 At this hackathon, we learned how to use SparkFun's ESP32 Thing using WiFi. We solved the problem of detection of holes using SONAR and Air Quality Index(CCS811) Sensor. We managed to connect HTML to Arduino code without using microSD card. We used a meta tag to constantly get live feed to detect pipes and cracks. We used a gear reduction to use a high speed motor to power our low speed drive wheel therefore, building a drive train. We prototyped the arms with different low risk materials. After prototyping, we slimmed down the design using mathematical analysis, therefore, creating functional arms. There was intense testing to determine the final robotic parts.

 We learned to use the Neura SDK, and learned a lot of new things in iOS developments, and we are extremely proud of the fact that we finished in such little time.What's next for ButlrIn the future, Butlr could have another version that would accept tasks from other people. For example, instead of you adding your own tasks, your boss could assign you meeting times and other tasks that would automatically be added to your task lists. In addition, if you are a high schooler like us, your parents could assign you chores to do around the house easily through the app, so you dont "forget" when you get home, along with teachers assigning homework and more. In addition, similar to trello, Butlr could have group tasks where a group of people, such as students working on a project or people working on a work related project.The possibilities with other people being able to assign you tasks is endless, and would result in a time management app like no other, especially with the help of Neura's contextual SDK.Built Withcoffeeiosneuranode.jsswifttwilioxcodeTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    Neura Do.AI HackathonWinner                3rd Place - Audience Choice                   Created by  I worked on integrating the Neura SDK with the iOS app, writing the server code in Node.js, and using the Twilio API to interact with the user using texting.Rishi MasandShashank SharmaStudent Hacker

 Taking this concept to a production ready Extension in an extremely compressed time frame. Utilizing many different technologies and platforms to make smooth, creative and fun animations. The best part about developing this extension is getting to be silly and creative to allow others to have a ton of fun. 
  
  
  
 I really enjoyed figuring out the dynamic asset service as this opened up a slew of opportunities for unique visual experiences.  This type of feature can be used in many different ways to provide a composited image to provide visual data.  For instance, the Size or Atmosphere graphs in Amazon's Sample Space Explorer Skill.

 We are proud of the fact we are able to segment and analyze the effects of the medication on the population and we wrote a simple, well-defined algorithm that should be flexible enough to implement with real data. 
 I am proud that the app actually came into fruition.  
 After a decade building AR software for everyone from Autodesk to Intel to Google and more, I feel that I’m past just the technical implementation or even “just rapid prototyping an idea”. I’m onto using my expertise in building software to maximize product design to create platforms that can scale and solve problems that matter to me. I’ve identified and executed on building an AR use-case to help brands sell products to millennials and beyond, and helps people feel better about the way they look. It’s a culture that loves social sharing of everyday creativity — and what better than creatively customizable AR try-on’s of real products? I would be grateful for the TechCrunch publicity to help push this platform forward, beyond the humble small network of this indie dev.  
 We designed an authentication system that uses cryptographic keys to link the game mod to our back-end, creating a secure channel of communication between the streamers game instance and our events server. Bringing this together on top of the complexity involved in having so many moving parts was truly an accomplishment for us.The first time we did an e2e test, and went from creating a poll to voting on options to seeing the item appear in the game was truly astounding! 
 The face coverage detection is the essential feature of the app and we are so excited that it works fantastically. 
  
  
 Truly meeting individual stakeholders that are working incredibly hard to solve our homeless issue. We only hope that we can build a good enough prototype to give them hope of what's possible with technology solutions.  
  
 We improved our architectural vision of a small AngularJS application as well as our ability to orchestrate a quick project remotely as our team worked from different regions of Brazil. 
 We are proud of the group's dynamics and that we were all able to discuss ideas and extract the best of them without running into any divergences.We built a nice API and we were able to learn a lot. 
 Our team of 4 people successfully built an application on 3 platforms in 36 hours, and our project will genuinely help the hacker community. 
 Effective utilization of infrastructure data. Crafting a full stack system during one day.  
  
 Created a fully working version. Our friend was pretty amazed about this app and the speed of development. He will start to use it very soon. 
 With the groundwork and descriptions of the system (its functions and benefits), we are among the 6 finalists of the UCSF Department of Medicine Tech Challenge, and we just won an innovation grant from UCSF DOM. We successfully practiced LEAN and Agile product development methodology and brought together the bits and pieces that we targeted for in the demonstration system, starting from assembling the team just 2 months ago.  There's still a lot of work to be done, but we see the potential of this team accomplishing the feat together. 
  
 Climate science is robust, but the presentation of climate data has been somewhat lacking. Such large datasets in time and space, combined with often complex statistical analysis of the data, can lead to a lessened interest in how to fully utilize the information. I believe this application, of comparing locations, provides a fun, inquisitive and information rich environment to both learn and plan based on local climate data.This model can continue to be refined to bring more data and targeted information to all. 
  
 We are very proud that we decided to take on something new for all of us, and that we were able to produce a functional proof-of-concept application. Furthermore, we could take advantage of these product databases to compare prices across retailers and suggest the best options.

 This is the first time I have been able to analyze my daughter's numbers in real-time and take corrective action based on the numbers. Lot of people rely on rules or gut feeling while managing their kids Type 1 Diabetes. I believe this system has the potential of making lives easy and protect kids with Type 1 diabetes from the harmful effects of sustained out-of-range BG levels. Since this system relies on text messaging to communicate the treatment plan it can help non-technical care givers. 
  
 We are happy to present an application that tries to positively impact the lives of the people. Our application is at a one-click launch able stage. We believe our application would be a useful tool not only for the general population but also to the medical industry. We also believe that EyePhone is not only capable of detecting cataract at an early, but also acts as an interactive tool that helps to educate the general population.  
  
 We have a working system, that seems feasible. The RFID readers that hospitals would need to purchase only cost around $60 (INR 4300). The RFID tags cost only $0.10 (INR 7). These costs could be greatly reduced by buying the tags in bulk and using integrated PCBs for the hospital scanners. Currently a government issued Indian ID costs $0.70, so a $0.10 increase appears practical.  
 For me personally, I'm most proud of how involved my whole family was in making this game. It was really exciting to talk about it as a family and as a team. My wife is really tech savvy and has a background in English Literature, so it was awesome to have her helping streamline the voice and language components. She also teaches 2nd grade, so having her insight into how to help structure the math-based game play was also a huge help. My son, Jack, was a rockstar – He helped with ideas, debugging and testing. It was really cool to see him watch the development process and how excited he was about it. We did a lot of tests with custom audio, so it was also fun to seem him learn about recording sound, recognizing audio as waveforms and starting to understand volume. Speaking of volume – Our 2-year-old, Luke, got a kick out of watching us all talk to Alexa. She can't quite understand him yet, but he's definitely saying, "Alexa, open Super Creature Showdown"! :)

 It is honestly one of the coolest projects I've been a part of at Wayfair. The amount of business intelligence we can extract from these graphs and data correlations are still coming in as we're writing this (we just found out we 'accidentally' built a recommendations engine too). The data still needs to be sanitized a bit more before we present to the judges, but we're hoping that they'll see the value in this, and will also be just as excited as we are to leverage elastic search in our analytics stack more at Wayfair.

 Guru is a near-complete application. We delivered on all our promises, a fully functional and instantaneous live stream viewer, a fleet of push notifications to alert Gurus of requests and the integration of a collaborative whiteboard in the live stream to ensure a better learning experience for the student. The fact that we were able to complete this in a mere 36 hours speaks volumes. We're extremely proud that we were able to get this far, to get this functional app that allows anyone, anywhere to connect with a guru who could be anywhere in the World and still learn valuable information with ease. Developing this app seemed impossible in the beginning, but one by one, as we finished off tasks and created features, everything came together in the end.

 The biggest accomplishment was being able to roll out the completed, working, beta web-application within the 36 hour time period. At this moment, anyone can create an account, walk around, and find any other users that are also looking to converse. What would have normally taken us a few months to have professionally developed, we managed to accomplish in two nights.What's next for ConnectOnCommuteThe initial beta for ConnectOnCommute was a major success, that's not to say that there aren't even more places to take this! First tweaks will need to be graphics, getting an experienced graphic designer to help improve the UX design and make the overall experience more aesthetic. Currently the team is working on making the web-app responsive for mobile displays, and in the next few months we're hoping to roll-out a complete IOS and Android app.The IOS and Android app would integrate bluetooth or NFC to allow users to connect on trains and planes and many other places without wifi or LTE connectivity!Built Withaccount/signupadobe-illustratorajaxangular.jsazureazure-iot-suitebluetoothbootstrapc#css3devopdevopsentity-frameworkfont-awesomegpshtmlhtml5javascriptjwtmysqlnpmscsssqltypescriptTry it outconnectoncommute.azurewebsites.net      Submitted to    HackHarvard 2019    Created by  I was responsible for coding the front-end of the application.

 It's semantically expressive to just have a <hacker-tile> tag that you can just put onto your site. The fact that we were able to go from not knowing Polymer to actually having a real working application is pretty cool.What we've learnedWhile building these Hacker Cards we learned quite a few of the core components of Polymer including component properties and data binding. We also learned that vertically aligning html elements is pretty much more difficult than learning an entirely new framework. What's next for HackerCardWe would actually have to test it out on different browsers. We are worried about the CSS from the page changing the look and feel of the actual hacker card. We'd also need to actually deploy the HTML fragment somewhere so that others can import it via the <link> tag into their pages, right now everything is just done locally. Ideally we'd also be able to develop some sort of loading state for the component, as right now it will just render the template without having any data binded to the template.We also need to spend more time thinking about dependencies and how users will acquire them. Right now the hacker-card.html fragment uses superagent for AJAX requests, which defines a global request object on the window which we would ideally prefer not to do on other user's websites.Built Withcssgitgithubhtmljavascriptpolymersuperagentweb-componentsTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    Devpost Hackathon 2015Winner                Dinner In on Devpost                  Created by  I suggested that it would be soooo much easier and cooler to use Google Polymer and create custom web components instead of just making a simple iframe.Matthew GerriorSenior Software Engineer @ DevpostI suggested the initial idea and made some minor content and design suggestions for consideration.

 For a long time we thought it's not really possible to move Canned Responses concept to JIRA Cloud because of deep integration with comment fields in Server.

 Using many features of the Intel Arduino 101 in our hack, including the built-in accelerometer, gyroscope, and Bluetooth modules.  We really felt like we were getting the most out of the hardware.Providing both an application and a web service for real time tracking and analyzing data - seeing how quickly our phones and computers responded to the Turnstyle was insanely satisfying.Inertial motion units are accurate within several minutes from baseline but have a strong tendency to “drift,” causing the device’s reported motion to be much different from its actual motion. This is troublesome in the case of tracking an object over a long period of time, but we were able to cleverly navigate around this by using the magnetic contact switch to notify when a baseline position in space was met. That way, “drift” over time doesn’t affect the device’s measurement of the door’s motion as we reset the drift to 0 each time the door is closed.Finishing without drinking any coffee

 We reached a wide spectrum of farmers and began to really understand their workflow, motivations, and challenges.We addressed both the hackathon’s challenge and farmers’ needs:An important part of sustainability is keeping food production and distribution local. Our map-based application appeals to farmers by showing them exactly what is happening on their land and in the surrounding local community. The Farmed application helps them understand their land holistically, using history as a teaching tool, so that they can make decisions that support increased productivity.Weather is the number one challenge cited by farmers. Our application arms them with historical weather data that they can use to plan crops for projected drought years. It is flexible enough for us to add real time weather predictions for short-term planning as part of future work.The Farmed application focuses on a specific type of farmer and is designed with him in mind. We ensure that the farmer’s interaction with our application will be enjoyable and to the point.

 We are proud of the result we could get for the amount of time in hand to develop. It was awesome to work with people we didn't know and discover that we easily shared tasks and how helpful we were to each other. 
 Family history is a big tent where everyone fits in. We feel blessed to expand that tent. 
 I’m proud that I finished building the app despite the challenges and was able to learn a new programming language (Javascript) along with many new technologies (Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Jade) in doing so. I feel that this is more than I ever could have learned in a classroom so I’m very grateful to have had the opportunity to participate.

 We are all incredibly proud of Overhear because it's something we all plan to use. We took a real-world problem that we and others were having and, from top to bottom, designed and implemented a solution for it. Two of the three members had not used Go before, and none of us had much experience with websockets. Even with these technical shortcomings, we were able to improvise and learn the new tech stack as we developed.  
 Our system is fairly modular given the tight time frame. It gives us options to easily improve and expand the system. 
 We are extremely happy to have our Twenty Questions working very well. We probably have played the game over 50 times to make sure we don't hit any unexpected bug. We had multiple people in random play the game to get user feedback based on which we improved the application overtime. 
 The UI is beautiful and user-friendly. The Autocomplete feature from Google Maps is well integrated.The core algorithm is able to generate routes efficiently even for a big problem-size.The pdf generation is fully done in Javascript on the client-side 
  
  
 Literary, every download of the app means one more life to save. In addition, the App does machine learning when it excels after usage where it reaches a point of self learning that you only need to draw a single letter to find your contact. A great plus towards simple dialing while driving.

 We accomplished a beautiful, seamless developer experience around sharing terminal sessions. We're proud of this because we believe it will enrich developer communities by making information and knowledge more accessible: imagine a git workshop, driven by this application. We're also proud that we use serverless and as a result, our users don't have to worry about failover, scaling or uptime – they just record, and it works. 
 yeah.  we managed to complete the project in time and learned new things. 
 Mainly I'm just happy that this project helped improve the safety of my home for my newborn daughter.  A recent study showed that every 5 minutes a child in the US falls down the stairs and is sent to the emergency room*.  If something like this could help prevent just one child from falling down the stairs it would be worth the incremental cost to existing baby gates. 
 We built this application and proud of the fact that were able to quickly build a working prototype in a very short time and the proof-of-concept already shows great potential and value to our prospective users

 Getting this done in a less than weekend.What we've learnedThat meteor is perfect for quickly building oauth based cloud integration and automation apps.What's next for R U Talking 2 Me?We hope that this "hubapp" and additional future hubapps will become, with the help of the meteor community, the basis for a meteor based open source integration platform that will drastically cut down the development time of advanced cloud extension, integration and automation apps, as meteor did for web development. We'd like the platform to eliminate most of the boilerplate code required by integration and automation apps, such as code that deals with one-way-sync, two-way-sync, webhooks and pulling, identity mapping, fields changed, data filtering and mapping UIs, and much more.Built Withgithubmeteor.jsrutalking2meslacktrelloTry it outrutalking2me.meteor.comgithub.com      Submitted to    Meteor Global Distributed Hackathon     Created by  Juan Manuel VergesRonen BabayoffJuan Sepulveda

 Overall this app is something we are sincerely proud of. I will list down a few milestones our team achieved.Building something that is super super intuitive to useUse of various different APIs like Clarifai, SendGrid and Exotel - thinking about use cases, and integrating them with the app within the short span of 30 hours!We wrote a search algorithm that searches a set of keywords against a huge set of keywords in a very small amount of time 
 Each of us is proud of something we did in the Hackathon: Ming Liang: Proud for implementing 1+ research papers in a day.Jet: Proud of learning adversarial attacks, web protocols and OpenCV.Bing Quan: We're proud of Bing Quan for teaching Jet and Bing Cheng web and pipelining most of the project. (He's asleep right now)Bing Cheng: We're proud of Bing Cheng for settling most of the user input data and user interface of the Chrome extension. (He's still working on it right now) 
 I'm pretty happy with all of it. 
  
 We are proud to learn new technologies and to successfully create a fully functional application.   
 After all challenges, seeing the app actually producing content dynamically was inspiring! 
 We are proud of CTF (McGill Computer Taskforce) united together as one to create a project we are proud of. As well, we are are also so thrilled to have to the chance to talk to 100 different people, make a working final product, and put our skills to the test to create something fantastic.  
 Everything! Air Compare allows you to compare Airbnb listings with nearby hotel searches but it also does so much more. By hooking in car rental prices, ride share (Lyft) estimates including travel time, hotel loyalty points programs and hotel amenities, it truly gives travelers the tools they need to create an amazing travel experience. There are countless sites and services that aggregate one facet of the travel experience, such as hotel or car, but we’re giving users insight into numerous areas that affect their trip in just one simple Chrome extension.
