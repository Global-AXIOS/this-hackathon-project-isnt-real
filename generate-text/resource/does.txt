Once you have setup the app, the application will display a map of the people around your current location. From there, you can see the statuses of these people ranging from studying for exams to eating alone at a restaurant. Clicking on a person with a status will prompt you to "wave" or add a friend request. Afterwards you have an option to communicate with the corresponding person and eventually get together for a study session or simply lunch.  
 Safeify allows users to report issues with utilities that cause public safety hazards so that the utility companies can know which items to focus on.

 NittanyChain secures all transactions via the blockchain: so whenever a student spends any money within their LionCash  Account, NittanyChain creates a new block with the information about that transaction. Then, to ensure that the details of the transactions are secure, the hash value that is generated by the blockchain is then solved by miners, similar to how many cryptocurrencies manage their blockchains today. However, instead of offering LionCash to a stranger who mines this blockchain, NittanyChain will offer amounts of Cryptocurrency as a reward (such as Ethereum). In order to prevent a 51% attack on the chain, NittanyChain will be mined by a Penn State-confirmed group of miners who will correctly mine the first few blocks, so that when the blockchain becomes open to the general public of miners, forks in the chain will become less probable.

 The purpose of our project, MediQR, is to transform the profiles of patients into small-sized, encrypted, and safe QR codes, the hidden information of which can only be accessed by the doctor who wrote the profile and the patient via a unique password. Patients can conveniently send their profiles by bringing, showing, or uploading the QR code to the Internet, without worrying about their privacy being disclosed. Project ArchitectureMediQR is implemented as a website, built based on the Java framework SpringMVC. The website can either transform a patient profile into a QR code encrypted by the patient id, or decrypted such a QR code based on the id and password. We use xml for our database and AES algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the medical profile. We use an open-source QR-code API to encode and decode medical profiles.What's next for MediQRIn the future, we plan to display the MediQR project onto a server and link it with a domain name.

 For the recipient: Homeless individuals go to a designated site to register for our HandUp program, where they are fingerprinted and face scanned. Given a GPS tracking token which reports to our server once a day is for the recipient's convenience, where in the event the token is misplaced, their latest known location data would be used as an approximate location for their whereabouts. Only the homeless user's approximate location is shown on the mobile app. They can switch the token on and off whenever they wish.They will fill in a form through our website that outlines a brief summary of their struggles, needs, and long time goals. For the donor: A user will download the HandUp app. If they are feeling altruistic, they can turn on the connection toggle on HandUp and look for connections in range. If the app encounters a GPS token within a certain distance, it will notify the user, who can look at a brief profile of the potential recipient. This helps foster a human connection and understanding of their situation. They can then decide whether to gift to the recipient.  On the recipient's profile, they can see specific areas of need. If the user happens to be a professional of that area, they can take further action by leaving their contact information down. After this, they will be contacted by a coordinator to help the recipient. After the gift is made, the recipient's debit card will be loaded. They will be able to use it at approved grocery stores, which will restrict the card from being used for alcohol and tobacco. They can only use the card with facial recognition and thumbprint..

 For a slide-show presentation see https://bit.ly/redaomint. For a screen-cast see: https://share.getcloudapp.com/NQuejBzyA reDAOmint (regenerative + endowment + DAO + tendermint) is a shareholder DAO that holds a pool of assets for perpetuity, distributing the dividends of those assets with land stewards in critical bioregions in exchange for protecting the land. The DAO funds itself by minting new shares in exchange for valuable market assets that produce dividends or rewards (such as staking tokens).The assets in the DAO are managed by the shareholders who can rebalance the portfolio and move staking tokens to their parent zones over IBC to delegate them and collect rewards. Through good management of the funds, the asset value should grow and produce dividends. The dividends cannot, however, be directly withdrawn by the shareholders - they are instead distributed to land stewards whose good land stewardship has been verified, ideally by a low cost technology such as satellite verification (something Regen Network is already actively working on).Land stewards enter into a contract with the DAO to protect the land, and as long as they keep protecting it they will receive dividends on a regular basis. This provides a continuous supplementary income stream for these land stewards. If, however, they degrade the land by deforesting it, their share of DAO rewards gets slashed, returned to the DAO and they can no longer participate. In this way the reDAOmint acts as a long term financial support vehicle for the land, which goes beyond what unstable government or non-profit support could provide.For investors in the reDAOmint, the investment is not, however, simply a charity and could also be consider a decentralize public hedgefund. reDAOmint shares provide dividends that come in the form of ecosystem service credits. These credits represent unaccounted ecological benefits from protecting the land which is an emerging asset class  estimated to grow from 36B USD in 2017 to 1T USD over next 20 years. An example of these are carbon credits, which will be increasingly demanded by governments and the public. reDAOmint shareholders can either use the ecosystem service credits they have received as dividends for their own offseting purposes or sell them on the market.In comparison to traditional mechanisms for protecting land, a reDAOmint provides the following benefits:insulates land stewards from seasonal variation in the ecological health of landinsulates land stewards from volatility in the price of ecosystem service creditsefficiently generates ecosystem services by good capital managementauditability of all funding and verification activity

 Squink is an automated market maker that enables extremely low cost swaps between USD stablecoins, e.g. DAI, USDC, and Terra. Fees for utilizing Squink are in the range of 0.05 percent of exchanged volume or $0.50 USD for a $1000 exchange. This is less than half the cost of Binance, the cheapest existing provider. Much like Uniswap, Squink is a lightweight plug n’play module that is easy to integrate into other financial and non-financial products. By integrating Squink, decentralized exchange aggregators can take advantage of small differentials between prices quoted in DAI, USDC, Terra, etc. to save their users substantial amounts of money. Likewise, the exchanges themselves can utilize Squink to aggregate their stablecoin trading pairs into a single integrated order book that offers better prices and deeper liquidity. Finally, e-commerce sites can uitilize Squink to accept any stablecoin, while still receiving payment in their preferred currency.

 AskLive lets you anonymously ask and answer questions live in class. It removes the social barrier of pluralistic ignorance, a psychology concept where if you see that no one else if asking questions, you may believe that you, "like everyone else", should understand the material and not need to ask questions. It also removes barriers for students who may feel anxious about asking questions in a large, impersonal class.After a student asks a question on the app, other students can upvote your questions if they also had similar questions or answer the question if they know the answer. TAs and instructors will be able to monitor and answer questions during or after the class. This allows course staff to better understand what material students need the most help with. It also utilizes the wisdom of the crowd, another psychology concept where the collective opinion of a group tends to close to the correct answer.What's next for AskLiveThe original idea was to share the data between instances by utilizing a SQL server hosted in the cloud. However, because of time and other constraints, we are currently using data local to each app instead. Going forward, the first change we want to make is to create that SQL server, so that different instances of the app can connect to each other.We hope to eventually be able to implement this app with a connected web application side for the instructors to use.

 Facial Recognition AuthenticationQuasi Basic Income DistributionOnboard New Users in Developing MarketsThe Raindrop.app is a conceptual platform to onboard new users into the crypto ecosystem, without having to have ownership of physical hardware. A new user can borrow a neighbor or friends phone, then access the Raindrop.app webapp on the browser, and create an account with facial recognition. Once the user account is created, the raindrop accumulation begins. Raindrops are a basket of cryptocurrencies/tokens which are deposited over time in a user's account with Elliptical Curve long term distribution. Once a reasonable amount has been accumulated, the user can export to an exchange or the wallet of their choice. The educational aspect is that new users are exposed to different and new blockchain projects, exchanges, and wallets, as well as other services that can be integrated such as ordering KONG cash loaded with their cryptos.The NFT features will allow for interesting use cases, example: organizations such as UNICEF, KIVA, etc. can distribute vouchers for tuition and education to geographic specific locations.We also launched a cryptonote fork with premine parameters as a use case for tokenomics design with Raindrop distribution mechanics.

We then proceeded to face challenges in our front end that included making our map interactableAccomplishments that We're proud ofWe were able to create an intractable map that has a properly scaling marker.  The marker can be moved upon clicking the map.  We were also able to actually host our website (which we felt impressed with after all the difficulties we had to overcome).What We learnedWe learned how to use MongoDB, and learned a lot of techniques for debugging DevOps.What's next for Geo-based Disaster Relief CalculatorWe plan to increase the scalability of our project.  We need to implement the different equations to calculate the different types of damaged with the different natural disasters.  Then we also need to calculate the different types and number of businesses operating in a given radius.  It currently operates on a macro-scale but we have created the tools to allow us to operate much more locally.

 With the use of Everett, delegators of the Cosmos Hub are able to mint bATOMs, a secondary shadow token backed by one’s delegation position. Two important features of bATOMs ensure them as an effective solution to the problems mentioned above.Soft Peg with ATOMs: bATOMs are designed to retain the same price with ATOMs. Just like most people treat WETH & ETH and DAI & USD as the same type of asset although they are completely different, by making bATOMs have the same price as ATOMs will minimize the adoption barrier for users and DeFi dApps.Validator Fungibility: Another important feature for maximum usability is issue the same type of tokens independent of which validator the delegator chose to delegate to. Compressing them to a single token ensures both maximum user simplicity and market liquidity.The eventual goal of bATOMs is to become the preferred token of choice for DeFi applications, so that delegators can utilize the bATOMs created using their delegated ATOMs and utilize them on various DeFi applications. This allows users to collect both the delegation rewards and the DeFi dApp interest, eliminating the competitive structure between those two, which in turn maximizes the social benefit.What can I do with itHedging & Speculation: A delegator can now choose to utilize the locked value of their bonded ATOMs are applications like hedging or speculating.Stake & Invest: It is now possible to delegate ATOMs and lend the generated bATOMs through DeFi. Increasing profits for users without causing a decrease in network security.Interchain Staking: Delegators can stake on multiple chains with the same capital by trading bATOMs in exchange for unstaked tokens of other blockchains.Leveraged Delegations: bATOMs can be traded for more unbonded ATOMs, which can be delegated to generate more bATOMs. By repeating this process delegators can effectively leverage on their delegations. This application is further explored by tokenizing the leveraged position and making them available for trading. 
 To solve this unaddressed problem, we have come up with an artificial intelligence-powered solution Ailee, which asks questions to the viewer and makes the experience more engaging.

 There are two modes, 1v1, and BotVsBot. The 1v1 mode is simply a dogfighting flight simulator for a splitscreen of two people. The BotVsBot mod allows for the ml-brains to take control of the sticks and fly the aircraft. They're given rewards for flying straight, fighting, hitting, and killing. They are punished for getting killed, hitting the ground, and fleeing the arena. 
  
 We're exploring the evolutionary dynamics of these cellular automata and visualizing them for an audience unfamiliar with the math. We've provided the theoretical underpinning of this framework, coupled with a simple graphical interface that demonstrates the localized effect of the interaction between two arbitrary rules. Cellular automata provide a way to bound chaotic inputs amongst a closed set of states.Independent of how complex your pattern is, you can always recurse deeper into the solution space because you can always generate more intricate inputs to be processed through the rule set that you have. This maximizes the amount of information you're extracting about the patterns in those inputs. This is why chaos is now bounded. You're simply limited by the processing power you have to recurse through this infinite space as compared to the complexity of the pattern you're seeking.

 Duke tutor is a remote tutoring platform that connects students with tutors and provides a flexible, effective, and interactive tutoring experience. Tutors registered with Duke tutor each have a profile including the class they tutor for, what time slots they can tutor at, and their type of teaching style. When students access Duke tutor, they first pick the class they want a tutor for and are presented a calendar of all tutors and their available times for that class. Students have the ability to view each tutor's profile to evaluate which tutor best matches them. A choice is made when the student chooses the name of the tutor, the time slot, and the learning style the best identify with. Once the request is verified, an email is sent to both the tutor and student including a link to the virtual tutoring session as well as a feedback form. The virtual session includes functions such as voice chat, screen share, and the control of a device from another device. After the virtual session both tutors and students will complete the feedback form rating the effectiveness of the session. Using the data from tutor teaching style, student learning style, and session rating, we hope to find relation between teaching and learning styles to provide the most effective tutoring service. 
 Probus is a DAO based on the Backfeed protocol that creates tokens (Probos) in proportion to community agents' participation and distributes Probos as a reward to participating agents who employ smart flagging. The Backfeed protocol is a decentralized collaboration protocol that rewards agents by reputation on the blockchain and tokens. Probus will have an initial offering of tokens and then move to a generative model where more participation on the platform will lead to the creation/issuing of more tokens. Smart flagging is done by agents wherein a set number of agents participate in voting on whether a piece of content should be flagged or not. The "winning" agents, or those who are with the majority consensus, are rewarded with Probo tokens. We thought about using the following technologies for each part of the Probus engine:Waves Token Creation: Initial offering of ProbosCosmos SDK: Creating a blockchain that would automate issuing based on the Probus protocol.Agoric: Creating smart contracts that distributed Probos based on the outcome of voting oracles.

 It is a decentralized mobile application that allows users to buy, sell, trade and refund their concert tickets easily.Each concert would be it's own blockchain. In the initial stage, concert organizers would supply a fixed number of tickets to the blockchain. These tickets would be regulated in the blockchain ecosystem. Buyers are only allowed to buy tickets. If they are not able to attend the concert or have to sell the tickets, they would only be able to refund the tickets (in which the ownership of the tickets are routed back to the organizers). This way, buyers benefit by:Having better price security when purchasing ticketsGuaranteed validity, authenticity and legitimacy of the purchased ticket (Immutability of the blockchain)Sellers benefit by:Having better control over their own supply of ticketsEnsuring that all tickets sold are legitimate (blockchain immutability)Business reputation is protected when no ticket scams regarding their organized concertsFewer empty seats in concerts will increase the organizer’s revenue through sales of merchandiseSince the blockchain is immutable, it only allows for one source of truth for ownership of the tickets.

 In such threatening situations of ongoing burglary, sexual assault, etc., we thought that people would benefit from an app that calls the police automatically but mutes the phone itself so that no sound comes from the call in any way, including the voice of the police. When the “CALL” button is pressed, the application would use the GPS to get the user’s location and use text-to-speech to convert the address into sound form so that the police would hear it — however, no sound would come out from the phone so that the user can remain undiscovered.Furthermore, when the “MESSAGE” button is pressed, the application would lead to a screen where the user can choose which counselor she/he wants to receive counseling and support from and start texting anonymously with the counselor. The counselor would not be able to see the phone number or any other personal information of the user, because the user is never required to enter anything.Accomplishment-We created a clearly-manifested home screen with only two buttons to press as well as a location detection function so that users who need to call the police can do it right away.-The Message function was created on a second screen, where the user can select a counsellor, sending text messages to the selected counselor, receive responses, and the latest messages are displayed.-The Call function would directly call 911 as soon as the user presses the button.ChallengesAll of our team members were first-time hackers entirely new to the field of application development. Given that it was difficult to pick up Android Studio within one day, we decided to use MIT App Inventor, an easier-to-use and more visualized tool for our project. Developing an application from scratch was still harder than we thought, including figuring out the functions of each built-in block and the logic to process it.Unaccomplished FunctionsWe didn’t figure out how to enable anonymous messaging or how to mute the phone call itself entirely. Also, we didn’t find a way to convert the address into sound and send it to the police automatically.Built Withmit-app-inventor      Submitted to    WHACK Fall 2019    Created by  Jiawei LiuHannah KimJisoo KimYi Lu

 In the physical model, we use an online tone generator to send sine wave sound frequencies to a speaker through a guitar amp. The speaker is attached to a driving rod, which acts as the vibration source for a metal plate attached to it. The vibration produces standing waves on the plate. By sprinkling salt on the plate we can visualize the nodal lines on the plate, as the salt will displace towards those line, away from the parts of the plate that are moving.The simulation displays a graph that represents a possible pattern of a square Chladni plate. Using interactive sliders you can change parameters to change the shape of the pattern to see other possibilities.

 ....Our project consists of two main parts:First, we pulled historic tweets posted during these catastrophes and rated how negative or positive they were. Using this sentience level, we were able to make analytical claims on the relationships between general public opinion and the amount of funding per damage done to these tweeters' areas.We then gathered datasets for disaster relief funding and disaster statistics (about 9 total datasets spanning about 600,000 entries). We used the DataScience module in Python Jupyter Notebook along with NumPy, sklearn, and matplotlib to conduct the data analysis. We looked for relationships between many factors such as type of disaster related to how much funding it receives, and the overall destruction level of the disaster related to how much funding it receives, etc. We made multiple plots of these relationships to determine which relationships show a correlation. We also used the Twitter sentiment analysis dataset to look for pre and post-disaster sentiment to see how a large disaster may impact general discourse in Twitter.

 AdaptChat starts by chatting with the user then determines the 'readability' of the user's input using the Flesch–Kincaid readability test. It then uses responses of different readability levels based on the English proficiency of the user.We used Google Cloud's DialogFlow API for the user interface and input recognition, and used Google Firebase to handle webhook requests by the bot. We used a JavaScript implementation of the Flesch-Kincaid readability test to gather an average complexity score of user input, then developed an algorithm that chooses among possible responses based upon the score.Challenges we ran intoWe had to ensure that we could apply the readability score to any piece of input provided by the user and process enough user data to to provide a meaningful measure. Because readability can vary from sentence to sentence and from measure to measure, we had to give our project leeway in case some implementation wants to use a measurement besides Flesch-Kincaid. We also had to learn from scratch how to use intents and contexts in Google's DialogFlow to properly sequence conversations.Accomplishments that we're proud ofWe are able to have meaningful conversations with our bot that actually vary to accommodate the user depending on how proficient at English the user is. What we learnedAfter discovering Google's DialogFlow and putting ourselves through a crash course on managing conversation flow through intents and contexts, we learned how to apply our JavaScript knowledge in designing web service functionality for a Google Cloud project.What's next for AdaptChatWe would like to train a natural language model, so that we can get more topics to chat about with the bot.

 We created a system for first responders to reach out to people in emergency conditions. A drone hosting its own network with a small raspberry pi searches for signals from our paired app. This app sends information to the raspberry pi on the drone including GPS coordinates and severity of the emergency. When the raspberry pi on the drone comes in to range of the first responders, it sends that information to the first responders and creates an API for the UI that the first responders use to locate the person in need. 
 We utilized a feedforward neural network and created an AI trained with backpropagation algorithm. The input of this neural network is CO2-equivalent emission, population, and (difference in ) world temperature anomaly. The output is annual world temperature change.We also created some classical world temperature anomaly prediction models, and we compared the validity/accuracy between two models (the AI and non-AI).Besides, we created a personal CO2E emission estimator. With this module, you can directly feel your contribution to climate change.Challenges I ran intoWe had issue with selecting the input/output of the neural network since there were no "real value" for predictions. We eventually decided to utilize less data for traning set, and use known data as our target.Lack of training set.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofWe made the algorithm work!According to our AI model, temperaure will decrease next year.

 Our project begins with a Texas Instruments CC2541 Sensor Tag. The sensor tag is then sewn into a baby's onesie or if the child is older, could also be attached to the exterior of their clothing. The CC2541 has the capability to collect IR Temperature, Ambient Temperature, Proximity, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Simple Keys, Humidity, Barometer, and Magnetometer data real time. For our project we focused on the Accelerometer, Gyroscope, and Ambient Temperature data that was being collected. The application Teeter Toddler does the rest, monitoring the data collected for any abnormalities or sudden changes in the babies movement which may indicate poor handling of the child, which may place the child in danger (Shaken Baby Syndrome). If the sensor detects such data, it immediately sends an audible notification alarm to the user informing them of the situation. The same is done with the Ambient Temperature data collected, if the baby is in a possible harmfully cold or hot environment, the user receives a notification to check on them. For temperature data, it is constantly being displayed to the user via the app. As the temperature falls or raises the app begins to alert the user via notifications, unless the temperature hits a dangers level and then the application sends an audible alarm. The goal here was to provided parents with protection and a sense of ease that their children are well taken care of in their absence in real time. That's not all, at first we look at this solution as a way to monitor others who look after our children but then came to a realization. The application could also be used in other ways, for instants. With the data being collected in real time, a new mother/father could use this same application to ensure safe handling of their child in their own hands. Also a growing problem we noticed in the news is the amount of cases where parents, perhaps due to stress or other factors, forget their children in the car during hazardous conditions. Teeter Toddler could be the determining factor in those precious few minutes of life or death, all with a simple yet accurate notification alert. With the Gyroscope and temperature data collected we could help prevent some of the top leading sleep environmental factors leading to Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Factors like the infant sleeping on their stomach or side. Babies placed in these positions to sleep might have more difficulty breathing than those placed on their backs, with the Gyroscope data we can help further prevent this. Another example is overheating, being too warm while sleeping can increase a baby's risk of SIDS. With both Ambient Temperature and IR temperature at our disposal, we could lower the number of cases reported with a simple app.

 Instead of requiring people to learn the intricacies of image datasets, we propose treating image labeling like a game of 20 (or N) questions. Users are tasked with answering the same binary question for groups of images of the same decision node. As users answer these questions, images are propagated further down the tree iteratively until they are classified. Users gain points for each image they classify and can redeem these in the future for gift cards. There are multiple advantages for this solution. By giving users much of the same mental task in a row, people don’t have to constantly shift their attention to different classification tasks and can therefore work more efficiently and have greater accuracy. One challenge arises in this solution: how do you produce binary questions at scale for a very large, specific dataset? For this, we use WordNet, a NLP dataset that encodes the hyponyms and hypernyms (supersets and subsets of words) in a tree. Since any tree can be binarized, we can create a new question set for almost any dataset instantly. We can use a Least Common Ancestor algorithm to find the lowest common branch of the tree for all needed categories and shake the tree to decrease the number of classifications needed per image.With BitWise, we can significantly increase the number of people who can help label datasets and do it at a greater speed than ever before. People can also make money in an ethical and equitable way in the process. 
 The interpreter reads in 16 bit opcodes from ROM files (max 3896 byte) sourced online, and modifies the appropriate states. The emulation cycle then repeatedly iterates, updating the window to the correct game states. 
 Currently, it's more of a proof of concept. It can be built upon easily, however we simply did not have the time or resources to build it out the way we wanted to. So as a result, this is a prototype of a potential final product.

 We plan to boost-up this search and relief process by deploying Artificial Intelligence.We plan to use a drone to capture live video footage of certain areas affected by the cyclone and relay them back to the center along with the GPS coordinates.The center would be having a Neural Network architecture running on a powerful machine that would detect the frames wherever there are survivors and flag the GPS coordinate of the drone.We have used a Faster R-CNN architecture that detects objects trained on the MSCOCO dataset. Hence, it can detect people and animals with great accuracy. The performance of the algorithm can be significantly improved by the underlying processing speed of the center which has been implemented in the algorithm.Challenges I ran intoReal-time detection with a less powerful machine is very hard to achieve in the real world. We had to use the GPU of our machine to run the "Detection". We had planned on deploying this method to the drones directly but it has been pushed to future hackathons.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofA client (drone) is sending the video feed to the server-side (Data-Center) in low resolution given the bandwidth constraints.This video is then analyzed by our algorithm which uses a Faster R-CNN (high accuracy and fast detection) and then detecting survivors in the aftermath of a natural disaster.After this, we have devised a way to flag off whenever survivors are detected in the video feed and then notifying the response team with the GPS coordinates of the flagged area.What I learnedUsing state-of-the-art NN image detection architecture. Working with PyTorch, deploying such algorithms in real-life.What's next for Helping EyeThis can be further extended to run a pre-trained low resource (less accuracy, kind of like the first pass) Neural net architecture on the drone itself and flagging the Relief teams faster, and then sending the feed to Center as the second pass.The Data-Center block can be used as a second pass to assure we have high accuracy in the entire system.The algorithm can be fine-tuned to run on low resources as a Raspberry Pi module attached to a drone. Drones can talk to each other and notify other drones about hot areas, such that those drones can automatically scan such areas which will increase the field of view.

 FiND is a tool that would be used by officials at relief camps across the world during a disaster. A new arrival at a camp would enter their information into our site, which would be saved into our database. They would also enter the names of loved ones they are looking for. Our system would return any matches with who they are looking for and show what camp they are staying at if they had been added to our database somewhere else. For security, the person being looked for would have to confirm that they too know the person seeking them. 
  
 This project uses various features to rate and critique a person's presentation. One feature is that it finds pauses in audio, or what the presenter is saying. This allows them to know when they pause, or where they make mistakes or are unsure of what to say. Another feature is that it finds repeated words, which also allows them to find mistakes.

 Clip It allows you to find the highlights of your favorite streams. Given the URL for a video, it finds the highlights by tracking two key metrics:1) Local spikes in chat message frequency (i.e. the equivalent of volume level in Twitch chat). We keep a rolling median of the number of messages sent in consecutive 30-second windows; and window that is significantly higher than the local median could be of interest!2) Sentiment magnitude of the chat messages. To detect this, we used Google Cloud Platform's natural language processing-based sentiment analysis API, which returns sentiment score (i.e. positive or negative) and sentiment magnitude (how positive or negative). We focused on just sentiment magnitude, as that will pick out an interesting and wide variety of events, from controversial to exciting moments! Once again, we track local spikes in sentiment magnitude compared to the rolling median to find clips of interest.We then look at the product of the differences between each metric and its rolling median--the clips with the highest value for this number therefore have large spike in both metrics. We return the timestamps with the highest values to make our highlight reel! 
 Our platform is a designated platform for the school itself, as well as students that need the transportation service and the volunteer drivers that are willing to provide the services. The volunteer drivers include the parents of other students, the community volunteer services (EMS, Fire, etc), and drivers with relevant credentials and a large number of community service hours. We want the school to create accounts for the drivers and the students to access the web application, and the school would be able to administer the entirety of the process between a student requesting a ride and the volunteer drivers providing the ride.
