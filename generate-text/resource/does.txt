When creating their account, a user provides information about their interests/hobbies and political views. They are then randomly paired with a user that aligns with their interests, but not with their views. This ideally means the users can connect on things they care about with someone that lies beyond their political echo chamber. Once a chat session is complete, we used natural language machine learning to determine how positive the conversation was. Users are awarded a cryptocurrency (called "change") that we built. A very positive conversation equates to more of our currency given.

Pocket Grow is an AR mobile application that supports the expression of positive affirmation in children ages 5 to 9. This is a critical period in children’s identity development, according to a developmental psychologist, Eric Erickson. The application starts with a breathing exercise that puts the child in the mindset to begin thinking about positive affirmations. This is achieved by a virtual agent that is projected onto the physical space (i.e. augmented onto the physical space) and facilitates the breathing exercise. Children are then encouraged to say positive things about themselves, and the more things they say, the more flowers and other plants grow around them.

We have created a basic website, on which a patient suspected to have some skin disease, can upload a picture of the affected skin region, and at the backend, our image classifier classifies into one of the 10 possible skin diseases. The website then generates a result that shows the probability of the patient having one of the 10 diseases. If the model predicts a high probability of particular skin disease, we plan to direct the patients to one of the best dermatologists in his/her vicinity, decided by a PageRank-like algorithm and can be visualized on the google maps, which is integrated into our website.

House Rules gamifies the process of completing chores by incentivizing finishing them on time in a fun and fair manner. Specifically, it assigns a monetary value to each chore and based on some cycle length and deadline agreed upon by the house, the app will randomly assign the chores to the members of the house. At the beginning of each cycle, house members are charged for the cost their assigned chores are worth. Then, each member has until the chores' specified deadline to complete the chore or they risk losing the money they were charged. In the event they complete it on time, they will receive the corresponding amount back, however, in the event that the chore remains incomplete, it becomes available for others to take on and win the amount the chore is worth. Moreover, House Rules provides a feature for compensating those who incurred significant hardships in their living situation, separate from recurring chores, such as cleaning up after a party or utility maintenance. When a hardship charge is requested, to keep things fair, either a supermajority of the house or the accused must confirm there was indeed a hardship for the payment to go through.

The app can increase the usage frequency by giving feedbacks to users' food consumption, their daily carbon footprint and build a community. Here is the interaction procedure:In this part, we include a complete interaction process, including two parts. Environmental behavioural theory Theory of reasoned action (TRA) and theory of planned behaviour (TPB) are common theories used to investigate the factors associated with an individual’s environmental behaviours.Persuasive technology refers to an interactive product that is designed to evaluate changes in attitudes, behaviours and their interactionsThe first part is a pre-survey for first time users, we use environmental behavioral questions and carbon footprint awareness questionnaire (See Appendix 1) to generate personalized eco-friendly scores that’s based on the average carbon footprint of the Moho community. A five-point Likert scale ranging from one to five is used to score responses to each item in the constructs. Each item is constructed according to the national mean and standard deviation. There are two types of questions: a),behavioral questions: “On average, how long does it take you to take a shower? 1, less than 3 mins    2, 3-6 mins    3, 6-9 mins   4, 9-12 mins   5, 12 mins and aboveWe will score this question reversely, add 1 to the total score if the user select ‘12 mins and above. ’b) carbon footprint awareness:“Global warming problems have consequences for my life.”1 Strongly Disagree  2 Disagree 3 Neutral 4 Agree 5 Strongly AgreeWe will add 5 to the total score if the user select ‘Strongly Agree’The app will map the score to the distribution of all users’ scores and present a ranking.After the new user finished the first part, they will join the other users to the second part: Daily log and how to reduce your carbon footprint. It begins the long-term (stable) food preference elicitation. This is to collect what the user generally likes to eat. The user can browse a full catalog of recipes from Mount Holyoke College’s daily menu, and mark those that he/she has eaten or would like to eat that day. This is also the part where the user can specify their diet restrictions. In order to find food recommendations which both appeal the user’s appetite, help them to decrease their carbon dioxide emission and have balanced meals, an active learning technique, which is called User Utility Multidimensional Prediction, is used. We modify existing nutrient-based food recommender algorithm to include additional parameters that are used for modelling the dependencies between the environmental component and and the food preference and nutrition component.

Puzzle of the Day is a daily crossword puzzle style game. The puzzles are built from the ground up for Alexa, and are designed as quick 5-10 minute daily experiences.Each puzzle consists of five words, and a theme.It uses clues similar to those you may find in a crossword puzzle, but removes the crossing component from the game. Instead, solving words give you free 'letter reveals' which act in the same way, but you can be strategic about when to use them. If you are stumped on a hard word, you can pass and rack up some letter reveals to help you with that one later.Once the user guesses all five words, they can wager some points on the theme. Points are earned from solving words, having remaining letter reveals, as well as time bonus for finishing under 5, 10 and 15 minutes. You only get one guess for the theme, but guessing correctly with a high wager could let you double your points.Once solving each daily puzzle, you can see how your score compared to others around the world with an in game leaderboard, giving you your percentile and place for time and points for each day. Users who are more interested in the stats can link their accounts and access the online leaderboards that I built for the game.

NittanyChain secures all transactions via the blockchain: so whenever a student spends any money within their LionCash  Account, NittanyChain creates a new block with the information about that transaction. Then, to ensure that the details of the transactions are secure, the hash value that is generated by the blockchain is then solved by miners, similar to how many cryptocurrencies manage their blockchains today. However, instead of offering LionCash to a stranger who mines this blockchain, NittanyChain will offer amounts of Cryptocurrency as a reward (such as Ethereum). In order to prevent a 51% attack on the chain, NittanyChain will be mined by a Penn State-confirmed group of miners who will correctly mine the first few blocks, so that when the blockchain becomes open to the general public of miners, forks in the chain will become less probable.

The purpose of our project, MediQR, is to transform the profiles of patients into small-sized, encrypted, and safe QR codes, the hidden information of which can only be accessed by the doctor who wrote the profile and the patient via a unique password. Patients can conveniently send their profiles by bringing, showing, or uploading the QR code to the Internet, without worrying about their privacy being disclosed. Project ArchitectureMediQR is implemented as a website, built based on the Java framework SpringMVC. The website can either transform a patient profile into a QR code encrypted by the patient id, or decrypted such a QR code based on the id and password. We use xml for our database and AES algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the medical profile. We use an open-source QR-code API to encode and decode medical profiles.What's next for MediQRIn the future, we plan to display the MediQR project onto a server and link it with a domain name.

For the recipient: Homeless individuals go to a designated site to register for our HandUp program, where they are fingerprinted and face scanned. Given a GPS tracking token which reports to our server once a day is for the recipient's convenience, where in the event the token is misplaced, their latest known location data would be used as an approximate location for their whereabouts. Only the homeless user's approximate location is shown on the mobile app. They can switch the token on and off whenever they wish.They will fill in a form through our website that outlines a brief summary of their struggles, needs, and long time goals. For the donor: A user will download the HandUp app. If they are feeling altruistic, they can turn on the connection toggle on HandUp and look for connections in range. If the app encounters a GPS token within a certain distance, it will notify the user, who can look at a brief profile of the potential recipient. This helps foster a human connection and understanding of their situation. They can then decide whether to gift to the recipient.  On the recipient's profile, they can see specific areas of need. If the user happens to be a professional of that area, they can take further action by leaving their contact information down. After this, they will be contacted by a coordinator to help the recipient. After the gift is made, the recipient's debit card will be loaded. They will be able to use it at approved grocery stores, which will restrict the card from being used for alcohol and tobacco. They can only use the card with facial recognition and thumbprint..  a creative domain name Using a multitude of software applications I have created a simulation that allows athletes and military to simulate events and missions, respectively.

For a slide-show presentation see https://bit.ly/redaomint. For a screen-cast see: https://share.getcloudapp.com/NQuejBzyA reDAOmint (regenerative + endowment + DAO + tendermint) is a shareholder DAO that holds a pool of assets for perpetuity, distributing the dividends of those assets with land stewards in critical bioregions in exchange for protecting the land. The DAO funds itself by minting new shares in exchange for valuable market assets that produce dividends or rewards (such as staking tokens).The assets in the DAO are managed by the shareholders who can rebalance the portfolio and move staking tokens to their parent zones over IBC to delegate them and collect rewards. Through good management of the funds, the asset value should grow and produce dividends. The dividends cannot, however, be directly withdrawn by the shareholders - they are instead distributed to land stewards whose good land stewardship has been verified, ideally by a low cost technology such as satellite verification (something Regen Network is already actively working on).Land stewards enter into a contract with the DAO to protect the land, and as long as they keep protecting it they will receive dividends on a regular basis. This provides a continuous supplementary income stream for these land stewards. If, however, they degrade the land by deforesting it, their share of DAO rewards gets slashed, returned to the DAO and they can no longer participate. In this way the reDAOmint acts as a long term financial support vehicle for the land, which goes beyond what unstable government or non-profit support could provide.For investors in the reDAOmint, the investment is not, however, simply a charity and could also be consider a decentralize public hedgefund. reDAOmint shares provide dividends that come in the form of ecosystem service credits. These credits represent unaccounted ecological benefits from protecting the land which is an emerging asset class  estimated to grow from 36B USD in 2017 to 1T USD over next 20 years. An example of these are carbon credits, which will be increasingly demanded by governments and the public. reDAOmint shareholders can either use the ecosystem service credits they have received as dividends for their own offseting purposes or sell them on the market.In comparison to traditional mechanisms for protecting land, a reDAOmint provides the following benefits:insulates land stewards from seasonal variation in the ecological health of landinsulates land stewards from volatility in the price of ecosystem service creditsefficiently generates ecosystem services by good capital managementauditability of all funding and verification activity The application helps the patient get a brief assessment of the severity of the skin lesion by simply taking an image of the mole  This is a React application that takes a city of a photo of an article of clothing and it will let you know if that is appropriate enough for the weather.

Squink is an automated market maker that enables extremely low cost swaps between USD stablecoins, e.g. DAI, USDC, and Terra. Fees for utilizing Squink are in the range of 0.05 percent of exchanged volume or $0.50 USD for a $1000 exchange. This is less than half the cost of Binance, the cheapest existing provider. Much like Uniswap, Squink is a lightweight plug n’play module that is easy to integrate into other financial and non-financial products. By integrating Squink, decentralized exchange aggregators can take advantage of small differentials between prices quoted in DAI, USDC, Terra, etc. to save their users substantial amounts of money. Likewise, the exchanges themselves can utilize Squink to aggregate their stablecoin trading pairs into a single integrated order book that offers better prices and deeper liquidity. Finally, e-commerce sites can uitilize Squink to accept any stablecoin, while still receiving payment in their preferred currency.

Ficient allows for developers to create arbitrage circuits across decentralized exchanges while leveraging flash loans to create value in a risk less manner.How We built itOur front-end is built with React while the backend is written in node and we used solidity smart contracts with the Aave protocolChallenges I ran intoFront-end: Interacting with the smart contract through web3 library on the react app was challenging as some of the web3 functions were not included in the base node modules.Back-end: Breaking changes to Solidity depending on version and compiler. Generating factory contracts and lack of error messages. Flash loans are new so documentation is sparse so we were paving our own way.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofImplementing flash loan functionality while connecting the front-end to the back-end and solidity functionality.What I learnedA lot about the Aave protocol and interacting with decentralized exchanges and also the concept of a flash loan and how we can use it in de-fi.What's next for FicientAllow for other use cases besides just arbitrage and support more decentralized exchanges.
