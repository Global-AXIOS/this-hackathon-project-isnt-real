I think it's pretty cool. They actually have the best amount of functionality and the best interface.

Basically the best way to run the game on your phone is to use a dedicated server. The server will send your game data to the server, and the Internet would be the only way to send it.

The idea is that you would see the game going to the server and posting it to the Internet. However, I don't think that's possible because there are so many different ways to go about that.

I think the most exciting part was seeing the game make its way to the server. It's like, from the definition it's pretty cool, but also from the design it's pretty weird.

The most fun part about the game was testing out what the textures could look like. It could be any texture, a lot of textures. I worked with the game designers to create the textures, but two of them turned out to be too much on the team's part.

The coolest part was the way the game designed the interface. I'm glad they worked on it. I think the interface is awesome.
