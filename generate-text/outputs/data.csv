"SmartCab","Blockchain based Egalitarian Routing and Financing of taxi shared taxi-cab rides","[5826, 'Mobile based On Demand TaxiCabs are disrupting the transportation landscape and yet causing grief in the form or expensive ""surge"" pricing. The goal of this project was to create a more Egalitarian ecosystem that recognizes the rights of TaxiCab Drivers to a just wage; the rights of consumers to fair and transparent pricing and last but not the least provide a way for Car Manufactures like Ford to participate and thrive in a period of stagnating auto sales. ', 'The above is achieved via two orthogonal systems viz Egalitarian Routing and Blockchain based Egalitarian Finance Model.Egalitarian Routing:Here the hack focused on creating a visual interface which allows women passengers to choose other women passengers. This increases the safety of women passengers. And with more women sharing a cab the price of ride comes down. However it introduces an unusual side effect. Greedy Surge Pricing vs Egalitarian Pricing.Uber has introduced the concept of surge pricing which benefits the driver and Uber at the cost of consumers.  An Egalitarian routing system that is beneficial to passengers, comes from the pocket of the driver as he might, have to, at times drive without a passenger (Male passenger might be available but rejected in view of safety). Hence Blockchain is used to note down the “good behaviour and monetary sacrifice”. The good behaviour is then subsequently rewarded at the end of the month.Blockchain based Egalitarian Finance Model.There are 3 players in the Blockchain based Egalitarian Finance Model. Each player has different goals and different vested interest. Blockchain is used to come to a common consensus and results in win -win for all.Passengers of Taxi-Cabs:Ideally want least cost of rides with no waiting time. Safety is paramount. Ready to pay a bit more (but not much more)Taxi-Cabs: Maximize the number of people carried in least number of trips to increasing profits. Typically a cab driver has very little in the form of a credit history and lives in pay-as-you-go world. This means he pays the highest interest rate and highest rate for car repair and maintenance.Car Manufactures:Have the ability and means to get best interest rates worldwide and implement and maintain sophisticated Blockchain based solutions. Their interest lies in creating a stable eco-system that predictably consumes the cars being produced.By creating a Blockchain based Egalitarian Finance model Car Manufactures provide cheaper access to credit to Taxicab drivers (who have no credit history or balance sheet to negotiate better rates). This incentive doesn’t come free. Its provided only to those drivers that act in an Egalitarian fashion, buy Ford Cars and provide the service the consumers demand.  Consumers in return have to buy “Ford Egalitarian Pass” a Blockchain based rewards program at the beginning of every month. This stable inflow of funds is used to reward drivers and pay for the slightly increased cost of travel at normal times [Yet cheaper than surge pricing]. A part of these funds goes to Ford for bearing the associated credit risk. The travel rates can change as more information and behaviour of drivers gets recorded on the Blockchain. Passengers who use this system more can also be rewarded. By locking in Passengers and Drivers via the Blockchain based incentive scheme Ford can create a pool of taxi-cab drivers that buys only Ford Cars. ', 'Using Meteor the Front end and Egalitarian Routing was built. This can be accessed via desktop, laptop, mobile and tablets.The Blockchain part was built on IBM Bluemix Blockchain (Beta).  ', 'Some Bugs are yet to be resolved but the software is at a “Proof of Concept” stage. Since IBM Bluemix is in beta very little of the Blockchain of has been implemented. Right now it just acts a ledger that dutyfully notes Egalitarian Routing. But the idea of doing Risk Management on the Blockchain is sound.  In future Ford can offload some of the risk using P2P finance on Blockchain.Also I used the free version of Google Map Apis which has a limit on the number of waypoints (Stops and Pickups). Thus if you look closely you will see that the last person is not dropped at his destination. By using the paid Google Premium Apis this bug can be solved. ', ""Google Material Design and Google Maps ApiWhat's next for SmartCabBlockchain based Risk Management is a very nascent field. But it provides tremendous hope and opportunity.

"Tactile - Perceived by Touch","Real Time Text to Braille Translator ","[2158, 'Many people know the saying that knowledge is power, and the key access to knowledge is through books. However, there are 285 million visually impaired people around the world, with 130,000 visually impaired people in the U.S. alone. Many visually impaired have to read through Braille texts or listen to audio files, and unfortunately less than 1% of all books are in Braille and less than 30% of all books have an audio version. In addition, Braille displays and embossers cost thousands of dollars, making them inaccessible to many of the visually impaired people living in developing countries. The mission of Tactile is to empower the visually impaired through education equality by enabling them to have the opportunity to access all printed texts. ', 'Our innovation allows real-time conversion of printed text to Braille. Ultimately, a visually impaired person would use the portable scanner to scan the text from the spine of a book to the outer edge of the book. The scanner would transfer information to a refreshable Braille display wirelessly, and the visually impaired would be able to read the Braille text and repeat the same process to read the next page.

"Kids Court","No more fighting! Take your rivals to Kids Court and watch them get what they deserve. ","[5461, 'When I first observed how people interact with Alexa, I noticed most of the adult interactions are either voice commands (""add milk"") or questions/answers (""What\'s the weather?""). Kids interact with Alexa magically. They treat her as a real person captivated in a small box and love to chat with her like a friend.Once realizing that, my motivation for this contest was to create a social interaction between Alexa and a group of kids. Usually Alexa dominates the interaction and the kids respond; My approach was reverse - I wanted the kids to be able to initiate their own story and talk about what troubles them, and have Alexa be an active participant that listens and responds to them. I decided to address one of the most agonizing parts of family life - kids fighting - and created Judge Lexy which is an objective, quirky judge that helps kids settle their battles. Welcome to Kids Court. ', 'Kids Court lets kids (and their parents!) settle their arguments in a fun way, while getting a peek into how the legal system works. The prosecutor states their case, the defendant answers, the kids can call witnesses and present evidence and finally Honorable Judge Lexy rules with funny dare-style verdicts that the losing side must execute. While kids probably mostly enjoy the revenge aspect, in the process they learn about the roles of a defendant, prosecutor, evidence, witnesses and more. They also learn to stand up for themselves in a calm manner, to articulate their problems coherently, and to take responsibility for their actions. Kids Court is intended for kids age 8 and up. Younger children can enjoy it too if someone explains the legal vocabulary.  ', ""I designed an algorithm that helps Judge Lexy determine if the defendant was guilty or not. I crafted a user experience that covers many use cases and is meant to be fun and engaging for the kids even if Judge Lexy rules against them.I also added a few easter eggs to surprise the kids, and put in explanations of some basic legal terms that the kids can ask about when they're unsure (i.e what's a prosecutor?). Technically, as I wanted to focus on content and user experience, I used thestoryline.io to build the entire skill. There are dozens of different logical paths and various possible responses for Lexy to make her character more engaging and the overall experience more entertaining. "", ""My motivation was to create an experience where Alexa is a social facilitator for a group of 2-4 participants. The skill has to let them talk freely and make them feel like Lexy is listening and responding to everyone. As every teacher/parent can probably attest, it was very challenging to create a natural yet structured conversation that keeps the kids in control, lets everyone feel heard, and teaches them something in the process.A major challenge was that Alexa doesn't pick up some of the things the kids say as either they talk too fast, get excited and step out of the flow, or can't help themselves and talk together. I tried to go around this by expanding the possible utterances for each state and creating default responses for almost everything they might say.   "", ""Kids and parents alike seem to really enjoy this skill. I tested it on a small focus group and it was beautiful to see how responsive the kids were, how naturally they engaged in the conversation and how much they enjoyed having Lexy listen to them. They interacted with the skill for a couple hours (!) and I'm really satisfied with how they believed Lexy was real and the pleasure they took in challenging her with many different cases. The best feedback was seeing their hilarious reactions whenever Lexy ruled. I was very pleased at how engaged the kids became even though there were no screens or any visual images involved. "", 'I learned how to design for voice and I learned a lot about how to design for kids. The idea I originally had changed tremendously once I tested it on real kids. Personally, this was the first product I ever built entirely on my own and not as part of a team. I had to deal with many issues that were new to me, such as voice design, use of ssml, technical jargon, finding and fixing vicious bugs that made the skill crash, legal aspects, sound effects, making a video and more. This was a super fascinating experience on many levels.  ', ""I plan to make Lexy smarter by implementing more investigation flows and a broader range of verdicts.Educationally, I'd like to take this game to the next level and introduce more concepts from the legal system such as an alibi, an objection, and more. I currently chose not to store any information about the users to make sure I comply with COPPA. I plan to look into it further and see how/if I can create a more personalized experience and create more value for returning players.Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy it!

"FC + BlinkCeption","Facial gesture enabled web control using computer vision","[5114, 'What starts with weakness in limbs soon progresses to muscle degeneration, which can rob a person’s ability to walk or use one’s arms. As of 2015, this is the harsh life of over 200,000 ALS patients. Similar conditions affect the day to day functioning of numerous physically disabled people around the world. We wished to try and lessen their difficulties. The first idea we thought of was to make their web experience  as seamless as possible. Since the nerve degeneration starts from below the neck, we thought of using Computer Vision to allow users to navigate websites completely hands-free using just their facial movements as captured by their webcams. ', 'Our project is a python program which enables users to interact with websites using just their facial movements such as eye blinks, eyebrow raises, and mouth opens. By using these movements, they can interact with buttons, dropdowns, slideshows, text fields and other web elements. Users are able to type text using a set pattern of facial gestures. These patterns are mapped to morse code and the output is shown in the form of text.Additionally, our program employs facial recognition to remember previous users and is able to run using the pre-saved ratios of their facial features. This means that our software can be used by multiple users. Finally, we allow the users to send emergency Emails and WeChat messages. Once the webcam detects no facial patterns for 10 seconds, an emergency message is broadcasted to all their preferred contacts. This is especially useful if people with disabilities happen to face an accident. ', 'Facial RecognitionWe use an existing library for implementing facial recognition of the user. This is used to verify and use pre saved thresholds unique to each user. For the blink, eyebrow raise and mouth open detection, we use a pre trained model that takes in a video frame and returns a list of 68 (x,y) coordinates of the facial landmarks detected. We then perform computations on this data to get the respective thresholds.Morse Code DecipherThe typing process consists of registering a blink as a dot and an eyebrow raise as a dash. Once the user is satisfied with the current pattern typed, they can open their mouth to enter the string into our decipher function. Thus a sequence of these operations can be used to interpret Morse code and type a complete message. WeChat and EmailThe WeChat message is sent using WeChat API, itchat. An emergency message is sent after a user to logs in by scanning the QR code. The email is sent using Python’s smtplib library which provides backend features for handling the sending and receiving of emails from one account to another.WebsiteThe demo website was made using Materialize which is a CSS library very similar to Google’s renowned Material Design.

And then other viewers would jump in on the pot saying they will add $3 per kill, and so on, and the streamer would accept the mission and put up notepad on OBS overlay and manually count their kills. Viewers who joined mid stream would not know what was going on. So we wanted to make an extension that not only helps organize this more visually.

"ORB","A fun, arcade game that emphasizes fast-paced, mental arithmetic.","[5539, ""I was inspired by the lack of mathematics-based games that were fun. Before developing this game, I'd browsed the App Store for educational games that weren't only adding and multiplying problems with a fancy GUI, but games that could engage an audience.  "", ""Dash through colorful levels and bounce off numbered walls in ORB. Exercise strategy and fast mental arithmetic skills to progress and continuously beat levels to increase your high streak. Intuitively tilt your device to guide the ORB through the infinite amount of levels. Don't fly off the field, get caught in obstacles, or miss the goal! As part of the difficulty curve, the game gets harder as time goes by - slowly moving into new obstacles and adding multiplication, division, and subtraction obstacles over long periods of time. To try to engage a younger audience, I made the game start with simple addition. Of course, to keep the game entertaining, the task of controlling the ball - which, in itself, develops visual motor co-ordination skills - still makes the game addicting.   "", ""ORB was made using the Unity3D engine along with its C# libraries, and some custom Java frameworks I've made and exported to DLLs with IKVMC. As I'm familiar with Java, most of the statistics controllers and background game management controls were made in Java. However, to deal with input and GUI, I used Unity's built-in libraries. Personally, art is not my forte, hence the minimalistic and colorful design of the game. Still, I decided to go with Cinema4D to mock-up and make the 3D models for the cubes of various sizes. "", ""ORB was not my first app, but it was my first game and the first experience that I have really had using the Unity3D game engine. Nevertheless, I had some challenges in creating the algorithm and figuring out specific gameplay elements. In terms of gameplay, I had designed the game with Darts in mind. This game, which you have probably heard of, involves the player throwing a set of arrows, called 'darts,' onto a board. Certain areas are larger, and others are smaller. I decided to take inspiration from this game and create the numbered walls of different sizes so, for example, the wall which increases your score to 5, will be smaller, and thus harder to get to. Algorithm-wise, this was hard for me to create. The levels are all 'procedurally,' generated which calculates the difficulty that a level should be (by the score but the hidden time it takes to complete past levels); it's almost like a piecewise function which operates as either an exponential, logarithmic, or sigmoidal function. However, with the difficulty being calculated and with different walls put together, they wouldn't fit together like bricks. "", ""Overall, I’m proud of completing and creating my first 3D game. The entire experience of creating ORB was extremely enjoyable and was a really good project to begin and get used to the Unity3D workflow. I am really proud of this fact and I believe that I am now familiar with this workflow and can execute upon what was before, just a game idea, in multiple platforms. Additionally, I am pleased with being able to answer questions actively on the Unity3D forums and IRC channels. I'm also proud of getting a Twitch live streamer, GameDevCompany, to test out ORB on stream in front of an audience of about seventy people. "", 'I’ve learned a lot through simply experimenting and reading through Unity’s documentation. Generally speaking, I learned a lot about the development of gameplay mechanics and how to actually execute them using Unity, C#, and Java. The use of Java in itself was a completely new learning experience I’ve known Java for five years now, but I am completely new to the fact that you can convert Java source code and use IKVMC to convert it into a DLL, and make it run like a fully fledged library in Unity. Additionally, through ORB, I learned concepts of the functional programming paradigm, a particular type of declarative programming which focuses on using short, maintainable statements like algebraic expressions or functions. I used Java’s lambdas and C#’s LINQ to exercise some fundamental functional concepts (that are part of these mainly OOP languages), and also utilized the ideas of filters, sinks, and maps. ', ""The next release of ORB will involve an easier level system and also a store, which has already been completed. The store has all sorts of add-ons, such as the function of shapeshifting so the ORB can fit through crevices in between rocks. To purchase items in this store, there is a collection system and a streak system. Once you've tested it, you'll realise that I obviously plan to make the game easier - the difficulty curve is not perfect as yet!The latest build of the game (when uploaded to the App Store), will also have a checkpoint/milestone system. If you pass a streak of five (or any other multiple of five), you will always start at that checkpoint.

"ExplORer Surgical","Workflow management tool for the operating room that enhances communication, awareness, &amp; efficiency and reduces cost","[7071, 'Two surgeons performing the same operation at a given hospital will most certainly have individual preferences that differ based on technical operative steps, instruments, equipment and medications required for the case. If surgical staffing and human resource constraints were smaller and less complex, consistent teams could be formed, and any problems arising from this variability would be alleviated via team experience and subsequent familiarity. However, consistent teams are simply impractical, particularly at large academic and community hospitals. Although nurses are very well-trained and experienced, the the preferences of individual surgeons are very difficult to keep track of in the absence of a comprehensive and interactive technological solution.Delays and disruptions due to missing instruments and supplies are commonplace in surgery, and this is directly related to the lack of a clear and up-to-date guide to a given surgeon’s preferences. ExplORer was built to solve this problem, one which our clinician co-founder, Dr. Alex Langerman (an ENT surgeon and leading OR efficiency researcher), faced every day in his own operating room. Additionally, when the surgical case needs are unknown, the tendency is to open more instruments and equipment in an effort to provide for any possible needs. This is an inefficient strategy that leads to longer setup times and a substantial amount of waste (anything opened in the operating room needs to be discarded or resterilized); what’s even is the “open everything” strategy still does not guarantee that the needed supplies will be among the mass of materials that were opened. This misalignment of surgeon and case needs and staff activity is a pain point for both surgeons and nurses, and ExplORer directly addresses these overlapping team needs.Furthermore, by more accurately aligning surgeon preferences with operating room setup, we save hospitals money by decreasing OR time per case and preventing wasted supplies. More accurate setup and decreased delays can also lead to greater OR throughput, which may increase revenue for hospitals with high surgical demand.Surgeons’ preferences and what tools and supplies are used in which step of which cases is a treasure trove of data that can be leveraged for hospital clients as well as surgical device manufacturers and purchasing organizations. Knowing how surgeons perform procedures (which step in which order) has potential public health and surgical education applications. Additionally, the very act of using ExplORer during surgical cases generates granular data on procedure progress that can be used to streamline OR management and can fuel predictive analytics on surgical activity (e.g., anticipating when a surgical case will end so next steps can be planned). Currently, there is no commonly-used technology to capture this intraoperative data. ', ""ExplORer, a web-based, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) workflow management application, is an interactive surgical playbook that promotes optimal teamwork in the operating room. Best practices are built into a customized workflow for each case. Step-by-step instructions and diagrams help surgical team members follow along with the case and prepare for what's coming next; in doing so, we help deter delays and disruptions that can occur from missing or incorrect tools. We also aim to reduce the waste of disposable tools that are opened but go unused – a major component of the billions of dollars of surgical supply waste that occurs annually in the United States. Additionally, variability in cost has a negative impact on patient outcomes. The analytics component of our software allows hospital administrators to track surgical activities and costs to better manage their ORs and gain new insights for operational efficiency. "", 'ExplORer was built with MEAN stack (Angular.js, Express.js, Node.js, and Mongo DB), using Socket.io. The application is hosted on AWS with multiple EC2 application servers running Ubuntu OS. We also use HAProxy load balancers. ', 'We needed to have instantaneous synchronization of information between multiple team members in the Operating Room with separate browser sessions. We solved it with the use of WebSockets. ', ""We have built three generations of our program and currently have a commercial version of our software. Our preliminary pilot results show that with the use of ExplORer versus the baseline, setup time was reduced by 10%, tool-related disruptions were reduced by 42%, and cost of the case due to wasted items was reduced by 5%.  These results can be directly linked to team satisfaction and reduction in operating room time. These results suggest millions of dollars in annual savings potential, not just for large academic and community hospitals but even for smaller hospitals, simply by using our product. The potential for cost savings is heightened even further once we receive our next round of funding and are able to build out an aggregate data analytics dashboard for stakeholders to view the granular data that ExplORer collects during live surgical cases. As we prepare to make our first sales into hospitals, this dashboard delivers an integral aspect of ExplORer’s key value propositions.We have received several awards. We won $50,000 through the Pritzker Group Venture Fellows Program, were awarded 2nd place at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business’ New Venture Challenge, named one of four finalists in the Cleveland Clinic Innovations’ New Ventures Healthcare Challenge, and named one of the 150 Nominees for Chicago Inno's 50 on Fire competition.We have been funded by a Phase 1 and Phase 1B Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) grant from the National Science Foundation.

"Pinage","Leave Your Message, Lead Your Life","[6022, ""Let me tell you a simple story. Sometimes I leave notes for my family member at home or for my colleagues at my workplace, especially when they are not reachable. One day I leave an important document at my desk and leave a note for my colleague. But for an unknown reason my colleague does not get the notes, as a result he could not able to complete the task. I think almost all of us sometimes face this type of problem. From this incident, I and my team think that why we cannot make this an automatic process. i.e. we leave a message in a particular location and when someone enter that area that message will automatically popup. From that point of view, we come up with an idea Pinage, a simple location aware message service.How Pinage worksPeople sometime cannot reach their friends colleagues or someone to whom they want to notify something. Pinage is the simplest location based message tagging service to notify their contacts. Using Pinage you can just simply leave your message in a particular location for your friends or contacts. When your desired person enter that area the tagged message will automatically popped up. As a result, no one will ever miss your notes. In Pinage the message will store in the server for one day only, after that this message will be automatically deleted from the server.How we built itAt first we finalize our full project features and the needed tools and APIs. At the very beginning of the development process we focused on the simplest UX and UI design of Pinage. We used Google Design Sprint method to design the UX and UI of Pinage. During the UX design we design a couple of mockups. After finalizing the the UX we develop the server end of our app. We developed the server end by PHP and the mysql database to provide the service to the client app using Rest API.In Pinage client side is an native android application which is built with the ALOHAR location API. We developed the location aware messaging service in such a way that user can get the tagged message immediately after enter the specific area. We used the ALOHAR location service effectively and thus we successfully minimize the battery usage of device to detect the Geofencing event. We used the some external library such as android volley library for Rest API communication with the server. We also used other third party library in UI design of our app.Challenges we ran intoAt first when we started the Pinage development process, our main focus was to design the simplest UX. The UX design takes a lot of time to start our app development. Finally after a couple of mockups, we design the UX of Pinage application in such a way that user can easily put their message using just single tap. Now user can just type theirs message, select contact and a single tap will tagged in the user current location for their desired one.After that we faced a lot of problem in detection of user arrival or departure event with minimal usage of device battery. At first we did not read the ALOHAR documentation properly. But when carefully and thoroughly read and inspect the ALOHAR developer document, we saw that how easily we can detect any Geofencing event. After developing the Pinage the second most hurdle we faced during the app testing time, as we have to tag a message in a location and we have to wait until the ALHOR fires either arrival or departure event.Accomplishments that we are proud ofWe are tried how simply user can leave a message in a particular location and receiver can get the message as quickly as possible when the receiver enter a particular area. The main hardle was how to detect a Geofencing event, i.e. how we can determine when a user enters a place/area or leave that place. We successfully implement that feature with the help of ALOHAR location API. But the integration was not so smooth. We have to test that location based message popping feature several times to finalize that feature. But finally we successfully integrate this feature with the Pinage.We also design the UX of Pinage in such a way that user can simply pin a message without performing many unnecessary steps. In Pinage user can simply pin a message. Also receiver does not need to open the app to check whether there is any message; Pinage will automatically notify an user if there is a message for him/her.What we learnedOur team developed many locations aware application in which we try to provide some information when an user enter an area. But the main problem in those apps was, we have to periodically check whether user is in proximity of a particular location. This process drains the device battery a lot. In Pinage we used the ALOHAR with our wrapper library to reduce the battery drain in determination of any Geofencing event.What's next for PinageDuring this limited time we mainly implement the necessary features. But we have planned to add new features to smooth the user experience of Pinage. For example,  till now the message lifetime of Pinage in server is one day, but we have a plan to extend this so that user can have multiple option for the message lifetime such as one hour[for short message], one week[for long lasting message] or message with lifetime validity. We are also thinking to add message conversation for a particular topic in private or public mode.  We will also add the social network like facebook, google+ for signin or to allow user to  import their contact or share their public message.Built Withalohar-mobileandroidandroid-studiomysqlphp5Try it outplay.google.com      Submitted to    Create Context-Aware Applications with Alohar Mobile's SDK    Created by  I am the team leader of this project.

"Project Julius","Seizure Prevention Software","[6055, 'In 1997, an episode of Pokemon aired in 4.6 million homes in Japan. This episode had a scene with many quick flashes that caused 685 children to be hospitalized for photosensitive epileptic seizures.In 2008 an online community known as 4chan posted seizure-triggering images and videos on epilepsy related forums and websites.In 2012 a promotional video for the London Summer Olympics was reported to trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy.The threat posed to those with epilepsy in each of these incidences could have been significantly mitigated with software that detects when potentially hazardous elements are present on a screen, and blocks them.  This is what Project Julius does.The name comes from Julius Caesar, the roman emperor. Julius Caesar was an innovative leader who has been post-diagnosed with epilepsy. We aim to innovate the seizure prevention measures in place for video on computers.How it worksProject Julius monitors what is displayed on the computer\'s monitor and blocks quick image changes in order to prevent seizure triggers.Using CamTwist and OpenCV to capture the images on screen.  We then process them using a histogram analysis in broken-down regions of the screen to look for quick changes.  If high-frequency flashing is detected, a window is pushed above all other open windows, warning the user and covering the threat.In order to analyze the display to figure out if there are flashes that we should block, we perform a histogram analysis on the image. First, we take 2 consecutive frames and then divide them into a 10 by 10 grid of pixel regions. We then analyze the colour spectrum and create a histogram representing each region. Then, we evaluate the integral of the Hellinger Distance to find the Bhattacharyya Coefficient. This distance quantifies the similarities between the regions and allows to easily see major changes in the image such as a flash. If there is a 95% change in the image, determined with the Bhattacharyya Coefficient, then we declare it to be a ""flash event"". We then compare this result to the previous 10 results for each regions, if 60% of the frames contain ""flash events"" then the seizing guard is triggered and the window is minimized. We analyze  the display at 30fps, and require of 60% of the last 10 frames to contain dangerous flash events to declare a possible triggering event. This makes Project Julius able to catch possible seizure triggering events after only 0.2 seconds.Challenges we ran intoThe first challenge we ran into was being able to complete the capture, analysis, and blocking in real-time with zero lag.  We altered our algorithm and refactored most of our existing python code, ultimately accomplishing precise analysis with minimum resource consumption.The biggest challenge we ran into was being able to accurately detect when an image was flashing repeatedly, rather than an object moving or a scene changing. A lot of things seem like they could be flashes at first, but are clearly not when watched by a human. By comparing multiple frames one after another we were able to better analyze what is happening on the display.Accomplishments that we are proud ofOur proudest accomplishment is learning about epilepsy.  In order to understand the requirements of our project we had to learn a few things about epilepsy including triggers, effects, and number of people affected. However, we wanted to go further. Since one of our team members has had family experience with epilepsy we decided to learn more. We learned about multiple different kinds of epilepsy, triggers for different kinds, statistics, long-term effects, symptoms, and the demographic of affected persons. In our opinion, the coding may have taught us new ways to accomplish our tasks, but we think the knowledge we know have will have a greater impact on our lives. Epilepsy is something we have have to deal with first hand in our life be it friends, family, or anyone in public.What we learnedDuring the creation of Project Julius we learned a lot about Epilepsy and its causes. Using online resources we discovered how many people it affects, common triggers, long-term effects, and large incidents in public.We also learned a lot about how to process large images (upwards of 1080p) quickly and effectively using histograms of regions on the screen. The changes in the histogram values indicate a change in content, a large difference indicates a flash or scene change. We then had to further our analysis to compare multiple changes to detect the rate at which the image changes, and thus determine if we should block it.Our initial approach to capturing the screen was to use the low-level frame buffer built into Linux. We spent a few hours learning how to access and process the frame buffer but ended up deciding not to go with it. We felt that using something built into Linux would greatly decrease our potential reach so we changed our screen capturing method to be more portable and cross-platform by using OpenCV and native desktop capturing applications that can pipe into Python. We found multiple programs for the different operating systems such as CamTwist and ManyCam.What\'s next for Project JuliusProject Julius is in a state such that it can be applied in many situations, however it isn\'t ready to be released fully. We hope to continue development and create a fully refined and deployable application.

"StockAssist","Helping you invest.","[6834, 'Humans will invest in stocks they believe in and sell stocks they don’t believe in; it only makes sense to be logical when dealing with matters of money and finance. Thus, accurately predicting stock changes requires knowing which companies are currently trending in the public’s favor. What StockAssist brings to the table that is unique to our generation is generating predictions based on social media trends. Older generations may look to news sources to inform them of which stocks to invest in, but this implies a lag of possibly weeks as news sources need to gather their data and edit it before publishing. By the time the news reaches the crowd, its advice may already be outdated. With StockAssist, we cut out this lag entirely and give you the real-time general consensus of how a company stands by data mining and implementing machine learning on social media posts. This will give the most accurate prediction of how stocks will fare, and thus is revolutionary in advising people with their stock investment decisions.  ', 'This web application will take the stock in question and collect all the news, social media, and statistical data about that stock.

', 'The first iteration of the application was written in Go. After discovering incompatibility issues with the Azure platform, the application was completely rewritten in javascript using Node.js. The application consists of two main parts the server and client, with each communicating with another through http requests.The server is where all of the heavy data manipulation is conducted. The server receives a query from the client via an HTTP GET request. The server then takes that query and using Twitter’s REST search api finds 1000 tweets that match that query. Then using regular expressions, the server strips and removes all the referenced URLs (in order to make the semantic analysis easier). After the data has been prepared, we perform an analysis of the tweets using semantic analysis tools hosted on Azure. The analysis tool then returns a score based the words used, and from that we generate a confidence statistic.The second part of the application consists of the client. As mentioned beforehand, the client sends a query to the server, and the server in turn returns a summary of the analysis it performed.

', ""Developing a web application hosted on Microsoft Azure was our biggest challenge. Initially, our team used Go to develop the back-end of the application; however, Azure never seemed to be compatible with Go. Thus, we had to switch languages, and completely re-write the entire back-end in Node.js. Another challenge we faced along the lines of Microsoft Azure was figuring out the Machine Learning. It was difficult to create training models with the help of different statistics such as chi-squared. We attempted to create an optimal training model on twitter feeds based on binary sentiment analysis. Upon building the training models, it was another challenge to create a predictive experiment based on the optimized training model, and hosting the solution on the web. Although we couldn't get the machine learning algorithm to work, we made great headway in learning this sector of Microsoft Azure. AccomplishmentsDespite all the challenges present, we were able to finally implement Microsoft Azure as a web host for our application. Even though we did not completely figure out the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, we made great progress in learning how to utilize this tool to perform sentiment analysis on twitter feeds. In order to actually create the machine learning, we used a direct approach with sentiment analysis through node.js. On the front-end, we were able to coordinate all the back-end to co-exist with the front-end. The most important accomplishment was to develop the Azure hosting service, along with our web application.What I learnedThis hackathon was full of twists and turns and we definitely learned a lot from it. From how to use Azure to what web frameworks work best with our front end, our general takeaway for this hackathon was to remember to reach out for help.

The Protect solutions were implemented by our SecAdmins via the Security Baseline. The SecOps workload is Detect, investigate and Respond to the Security alerts and to minimize the number of false-positives (our security baseline helps with that). ', 'We leveraged the Security Graph API to read the security alerts, first via a pull mechanism and in the next version in a push mechanism via notifications.

The same approach applies to the Infrastructure solution.The solution supports multi-tenancy and we safely store the data to enrich the tickets (e.g. classify the object like the user, device or data of the c-level management).To elaborate on that, we gather information about security from the following sources:Graph API - Security AlertsSecure ScoreSecure Score Control Profiles (for recommendations on raising secure score)Graph API - Sign-InRetrieving the last sign-ins of a user to determine if authentication was with MFA enforced. If so automatically closing the security alert.Graph API - Directory AuditMonitor users for strange behavior, especially on sign-ins from an unfamiliar location.Next to the Graph API we also get information through Azure Resource REST API to gather: All Azure ResourcesWe get notified on resources that are not monitored by our SOC and therefore are a possible threat for breaches.

"Holdup","Send Gamified Messages to Your Friends!","[3896, 'Fun new ways to communicate with friends are growing in popularity, and we wanted to build a communication tool of our own. We took inspiration from the ""money maze"" toy, which locks a gift in a transparent cube maze. In order to unlock the cube and get the gift inside, the recipient must complete a complex puzzle. ', ""Holdup is an iMessage app that allows users to send secret messages and payments. The catch is that in order to read the message and accept the payment, the recipient must complete a challenging mini-game. The game uses the device's accelerometer, and is intended to frustrate users who want to read the message or receive their money. Senders can choose from three difficulty levels, and a unique game level is automatically generated. The communication is built directly into the iMessage platform, which allows users to send the mini-game to their friends, even if they don't have the app installed. "", 'The app is written in Swift and built with Xcode. It exists almost exclusively as an iMessage extension. The mini-game uses SpriteKit, a 2D game engine, to render sprites, simulate physics, and detect collisions. ', ""The iMessage platform has a lot of restrictions, many of which are undocumented. Because the app exists as an extension inside the Messages app, many normal app capabilities are unavailable. We ran into a dozen of such issues, and adapted the design of the app to fit into the given constraints. Although our final result had to undergo many unforeseen design revisions, we're happy that we were able to create a working and fun application. "", ""We're especially proud of our ability to iterate quickly. Our app design and vision experienced three major overhauls over the course of the weekend, and experienced many minor tweaks and adjustments. Some of these changes were prompted by an analysis of the app and consideration of how well it aligned with the user's goals. One quick example: We originally envisioned the ability to create custom mini-game levels via a drag-and-drop level builder. We thought that the sender would enjoy creating a custom experience for their friend, so they could be as nice or mean as they desired. As we considered the concept and talked with others, we discovered that the sender would rather be able to create a challenging mini-game quickly and generally finds more value in their recipient's reaction than the implementation of the actual game level. Since we structured the app well, we were able to react to these changes and make a better end product as a result. "", 'We learned a bunch about the Message extension iOS framework, but more generally learned about technical risk. When we committed to creating an iMessage app, we reaped many benefits, but also inherited some challenges. Because the technology and user experience are so tightly coupled, we had to make some tradeoffs that affected the end users. However, the additional constraints imposed by the framework forced us to ask tough questions and refine our idea more than we otherwise would have. Our final result is simpler, cleaner, and more extensible than our original vision. ', 'The App Store! The app works really well, and the design is polished.

We try to solve the above four challenges as follows in a ""deep learning mindset"":Hard to find existing fonts: nearest-neighbor retrieval in the latent space! Select two existing fonts, get the embedding of them, and you can retrieve an existing font with the taste of both.License issues: generate fonts with trouble-free data! We compiled a dataset of Google Fonts with the SIL Open Font License which ""permits the fonts to be used, modified, and distributed freely"" with ~2K fonts ~120K characters. We aim to learn a greater font manifold with the ""base fonts"" free of license issues.Font design is time-consuming: have fun searching for new fonts in the latent space! With latent vector arithmetics, you can achieve a style like ""get a bold Times font using a normal Times font and the bold-ness of Bold Helvetica without the Helvetica-ness"".Raster font images are not deployable: generate TTF vector files! With the generated raster image, you can train a model to trace the boundaries and obtain the vector font files (integration to the interface pending).Font generation is a field with huge potentials. A deployable font generation toolkit can change the entire workflow of a typographer and therefore reshape the design industry. ', 'We build all our models in PyTorch.Font retrieval model: we used the pre-trained model provided by [FIXME: add link] to retrieve fonts in the Google Fonts dataset.Raster font generation:1) Variational Autoencoder: we implemented our own autoencoder to learn the latent space of different characters and fonts.2) StarGAN: we modified the code of [FIXME: add link] to manipulate different attributes of a character, such as bold-ness and serif-ness.Vector font generation: we tried to reproduce the model proposed by A Learned Representation for Scalable Vector Graphics, implementing it from scratch. We first train a variational autoencoder on raster images and use gated recurrent units and a mixture density network to generate SVG commands and obtain vector font files. ', 'Attributes of a character can be hard to learn. For example, we tried to learn the serif-ness of a character with StarGAN, but it does not produce comparable results with simple latent space interpolation with VAE.The representation of a vector file is vastly different from that of an image. Even if we could get a correct base VAE model to generate raster images, the recurrent units to produce command tokens and numbers are hard to train and we could not get a reasonable result.Hooking up the back-end models with the front-end UI needs a lot of communication and engineering. ', 'Font retrieval modelCompiling the Google Fonts datasetInterpolation between two fontsManipulating the attributes of a fontGenerating SVG fonts ', 'In addition to providing a toolkit, this project provides a method overview for the task of Font Generation. We have a few observations during the development:Start from simple fonts. We observe that simple fonts such as sans serif are easier to generate and manipulate than highly stylized ones such as handwriting. However, in the typography market, these simple fonts are on the highest demand. Therefore instead of focusing on generating fonts with crazy styles, we can work on producing production-grade simple fonts that improve readability.Data is crucial. A utopian vision is to learn the font manifold and produce open-source industrial-grade fonts to everyone. However, to learn this model, it is always good to get more data, especially for the highly stylized fonts. With more typographers contributing to open-source fonts, we can achieve this goal earlier.Vector paths is a visual representation worth looking into. This is not only important for the task for Font Generation, but for a resolution-independent representation for computer vision in general, such as image segmentation, data annotation, and art creation.

"Hamaisha"," Inspiring meaningful engagement of students into a competence based curriculum !","[5220, 'The Government  of Kenya  began piloting the 2-6-3-3-3 system of education, designed by the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD), in selected public schools in January 2019. Inadequate training and information has been  hindering the implementation of the new curriculum, as most teachers teachers have said. There has been criticism that  the Government has been focusing  on training only teachers employed by the Teachers Service Commission (TSC).The truth is that given the huge number of learners, most teachers in lower primary are employed by parents. This locks them out yet they are the ones to teach the new system. There has been much emphasis on digital learning yet there has been no adequate equipment to deliver  it. Taking an example as a teacher You teach for 10 minutes and you are told to play a video but you realize you have no decoder and or even the video itself. On the other hand In the private sector, school managers are forced to pay Sh7,000 per teacher for the training. They also buy books. The postponement of the new curriculum, means to financial losses. However there is a gap that Hamaisha platform comes in, according to the Deputy President William Ruto more than 700,000 Class One pupils out of 1.2 million have received tablet computers under the digital literacy programme. Inaddition to that , Jomo Kenyatta University of Science and Technology (JKUAT) had partnered with Kenya Private School Association (Kepsa) to ensure private institutions also benefit from the laptops project.The deal with JKUAT will see the university manufacture about four million devices for the next three years at a fixed price of Sh15, 000 per device.The devices will be distributed to over 11,000 private schools throughout the country and are expected to benefit over 1.8 million pupils.Irregardless of this tablets and laptops, there has not been a clear way to inculcate learning materials of the new curriculum into the tablets and laptops. Also there has been no proper, easier and cheaper way to train the teachers and also incorporate parents in implementing the new curriculum. Hamaisha is a swahili name meaning derived from the word Kuhamaisha meaning inspire with a goal to help solve these problems through a digital platform. ', 'Hamaisha incorporates teachers portfolios, student portfolios,formative incentives and parents communication all in one place !

"Magnetic Fish Spectacular!","bigger, crazier, electronic version of an old childhood game","[6179, 'Was going toy shopping, as one does, when I walked by this old childhood game. A feeling of nostalgia swept over me as I remembered catching the little fishes with the tiny rod that is more fit for hamsters than humans. Suddenly I imagined what if this were more adult sized, how funny would that be? Now here we are, making it happen. Or at least trying to :) ', ""It's a wooden platform with holes containing fish inside that spins around inside a kid swimming pool via a motor. The fish have RFID cards inside with magnets. The rods use magnets to catch the fish. Each rod will have the ability to detect which fish was caught and how many points it was worth. "", 'THE FISH6 total that sit inside the holes of the wooden platform.Each fish was made out of 2 mixing bowls. One slightly bigger than the other, so that the top half bowl can swivel over the bottom bowl when the fish opens and closes its mouth. The top bowl is connected to the bottom with a wooden dowel and twisty ties. The top fin is made out of hard foam we found at AxMan. The hard foam fin was screwed in to the top half bowl and the googly eyes were glued on using E6000. We gave each fish a unique look with a sharpie marker and googly eyes. Inside the bottom bowl of the fish, we sanded the surface down and then used E6000 to attach two ceramic magnets, followed by an RFID card, and topped with another two ceramic magnets. The only piece inside the fish that is glued down is the first magnet since we wanted people to be able to easily remove the fish from the rod once caught.THE SMART FISHING RODThe tip of the rod contains an RFID sensor with two magnets in the middle (taped together) and that is wired all the way up the line and down the rod that will connect to the teensy inside the box located near the base of the rod. This wire is secured with zip ties along the way.The tip of the rod has the top half of a 3 inch diameter plastic Easter egg to hide the RFID sensor and was meant resemble the cartoonish design of the tiny rods from the original game. A positive side effect of this is that it makes the game a little more challenging because you have to angle the rod and have it timed just right in order to catch the fish.The fishing line is made out of colorful paracord that has its ends singed off with fire.Each rod is created using a wooden dowel attached to a foam sword handle.Towards the base of the rod will be a container holding all the circuitry and components of the smart fishing rod. We will be putting all the components together inside this container, the day of the hackathon. Each container will have the following: an RFID sensor board, an OLED screen, a 2 ohm speaker, an MPU (gyroscope/accelerometer), a teensy with prop shield, and a 5V battery pack.THE PLATFORMA circular wooden platform that is approximately 4 ft in diameter, that fits inside the kid swimming pool.There are 6 holes in the wooden platform for sitting the fish inside. The rim of the bottom bowl for each fish sits perfectly inside each hole.There are four wheels mounted to the bottom and located towards the outside of the platform, one in each quadrant of the circle if you were to divide it into four equal parts.The motor will drive a spinning wheel under the edge of the platform that will hopefully rotate the platform smoothly.There is a hinge installed going down the middle of the wooden platform to allow for folding up of the circular wooden platform into two halves. It is divided in such a way that 3 wheels are under one half of the platform and a single wheel is under the other half of the platform. This is to allow for easier transportation.THE MOTORA hole will be made on the side of the kid swimming pool to affix the spinning driver wheel on the inside and attach it to the motor on the outside. We will test out the motor for the first time, find the right speed to play the game at, and make a control station for the motor all on the the day of the hackathon. THE INCLINING BASEFour incline wood pieces attached to a wooden pegboard with nuts and bolts.Fits under the center of the pool, had to be elevated by 2 foam sheets underneath. This helps give the fish the extra height so their mouths will fall open wider, making them easier to catch when they are on the tallest part of the incline.We will need to affix the center of the inclining base to the center of the pool the day of the hackathon to keep the inclining base from sliding around and getting caught underneath the wheels.  ', ""The most challenging aspect was thinking up the whole design of the fish and the platform, as well as thinking of what is the catch a fish condition. We ended up sticking to the engineering design of the original fish game (inclines underneath the platform lining up under some of the holes), just bigger in size. The RFID sensor reads the RFID card even when it's 2 inches away, so we needed to think of another aspect we could test for in order to detect whether someone caught a fish. In the end, we decided the win condition should be a mixture of reading the RFID code while the rod position has changed significantly to show they are still holding onto the fish while it's up in the air.

"X-Terminator Drone","Reflecting UV light off of aluminum-coated propellers of an autonomous drone can inactivate deadly viruses.","[8228, 'Spurred by wanting to find a hack that bridged each of our specialties (optical sciences, biomedical engineering, and computer science) in addition to the recent Ebola outbreak and epidemics in general, the X-Terminator Drone was born. This hack aims to reduce the risk of healthcare workers and volunteers in the face of an epidemic by using drones to UV sterilize the field.  ', 'The X-Terminator Drone uses UV light that is reflected off of sputter-coated aluminum propeller blades to inactivate viruses (by irreversibly damaging its genetic material), making them no longer deadly and unable to replicate. The ultimate application of this hack is for healthcare facilities and patient clinics to be sterilized of harmful pathogenic diseases without need for human contact with deadly viruses and pathogens. High-risk areas can be first sanitized by a drone prior to human contact. ', 'To automate the Parrot AR Drone 2.0 Elite, an Arduino Uno connected to multiple ultrasonic distance sensors was connected to the drone. Each propeller blade was sputter-coated with aluminum metal (~50nm thick) to reflect UV light. A UV light source was mounted under each propeller blade at an ideal distance from the blade to best reflect the UV light below the drone (the physics is explained on our website). Finally, the drone itself was programmed to autonomously roam a room via feedback from its distance sensors mounted in each direction, at an altitude permitting UV inactivation of viruses and pathogens.  ', ""This was a very technical hack that involved many endless hours of troubleshooting, especially since none of us had done many of the technical hardware and software hacks involved. We were new to the Arduino and drones, as well as how to build the circuits we needed. This hack first involved identifying multiple UV light sources, of which we went through a couple LED light options before our final solution. Along the way, we encountered faulty hardware, and our procedure of soldering and connecting our initial ideal higher-powered UV LED lights resulted in their electrical failure. We then had to improvise and go with another set of different LED lights that were in the UV spectrum. Next, there is little documentation of hacking a Parrot Drone with an Arduino that combines all of the endpoints we included in our hack. Beginning with wiring the circuitry on breadboards to connect multiple distance sensors to the Arduino, we encountered issues with the readout and responses that we had to troubleshoot. Part of the issues were related to the voltage, and we eventually figured this out. Next, there were differences in Drone pinouts than what was posted online, we had to identify through voltage drops and differences the functions of the pinouts, and then connect the drone to the Arduino. For many hours, we were only able to connect successfully the computer to the Arduino and receive proper printouts from the sensors, and not from the Arduino to the drone. To solve this issue, we had to seek some advice on matching the voltages between our various types of hardware in order for all of our code, hardware and sensors to communicate. Based off of the advice and feedback we received, and online forums, we put together a level converter to divide voltage that allowed communication between the sensors, drone, and Arduino to finally happen (BUT, not before we faced a malfunctioning Arduino, and after using a fresh one we figured out that this had been the problem for a couple hours). Next, we had to weigh all the components and shave off any excess weight-- considering a second voltage divider to draw less energy. After that, we had to figure out the actual hardware and mechanical mounting of the LED lights. The next challenge was consolidating all of our multiple circuits into one small and lightweight board. Then finally, we wanted to command the flight of the drone to be similar to an iRoomba vacuum. We wrote javascript to automate the this type of room sweep via drone flight movements. This was one of the toughest hacks, as it was not clear in any instructional references we could find how to actually control the drone via the Arduino while using the sensors. We spent at least a full 16 hours on trying to get the communications between the devices working. Finally, we succeeded in reflecting UV light off our of drone propellers at the end, which allowed us to consider our hack a proof-of-concept for use during an epidemic. Accomplishments that we are proud ofThe amazing collaborative teamwork and the fact my team worked together non-stop to make this happen! What an incredible effort, especially given that none of us have done much of the things we had to figure out for this hackathon. We each learned how to integrate and utilize new hardware, software components and languages, and had to draw from past science classes as far back as high school for the scientific concepts.What we learnedMany many things, already alluded to in the challenges section... mostly along the lines of working with new hardware, circuits, writing Arduino code, working with Arduino libraries, interfacing multiple technologies, hacking a drone, new/unfamiliar coding languages, etc. What's next for X-Terminator DroneTrying to find the support to turn this drone into a reality where it can be utilized out in the field.

The game uses custom gestures to control the firing of projectiles and the placing of 'blocker' walls, which allow a player to temporary block the path of oncoming balls. Projectiles are constrained by an ammo counter that re-fills over time, encouraging accuracy over the bullet-spam approach, although depending on the situation sometimes both work. This is a desktop Windows app that integrates with the Lenovo Aura interface. "", ""The game was developed mainly in C# using the Unity 3D engine. Most of the effort went into the custom gesture recognition and visual effects. The gestures were coded based on the raw input data from Unity's API. Whilst Unity goes a long way to help with regards to rendering, we put quite a bit of time into the custom shaders: the burnup dissolve effect of the asteroids and the convolution pixel shader ripples. Unity's own physics and mesh colliders meant that the game object interactions were mostly fairly simple to implement, meaning we had time for some polish in the competition schedule. "", ""The two main challenges we faced were performance and the integration of a touch library. I had a fantastic old multitouch library I intended on re-using, but this was not compatible with Unity's window handle, so I had to re-create it based on Unity's API. It was the first time we've hit performance issues since learning Unity, so we had to familiarise ourselves with Unity's profiling tools and in particular how Unity batches draw calls. "", ""It's always good to hit a deadline. We had some unexpected things come up and get in the way of development, but we managed to compromise on some features as appropriate to balance both getting it done and to a good standard.We're especially proud of our first custom shaders in a Unity game. Modern devices have fantastic graphics capabilities, so it's great to be able to show them off.

"Median ","A messaging app for centralized narrative communication in a dyanamic healthcare environment.","[3592, 'The medical care industry has lacked a homogenous system for patient data tracking since the dawn of the digital era. Patients are required to repetitively fill out paperwork that details their health status every single step of the way through patient care. Whether it be a health clinic, the hospital emergency room, or a healthcare specialist, data needs to be entered and re-entered into a new system; a system that is disconnected from its counterparts, leaving both patients and professionals at the mercy of these tedious practices, instead of focusing their attention and effort to patient care. Even within a single hospital unit, patient data needs to be communicated in real-time to multiple parties, especially in intensive-care situations. Median works to get everyone: the patient, doctors, nurses, specialists on the same page and allows for the documentation of patient data in a way that is focused and allows for optimal patient care.

Commute time is not used as well as it could be. If I could listen to my email while driving or sitting in traffic I could think about what I need to do and formulate what I need to go back to people with. This is what started my search for an app that would read out my email for me that was distraction free and could be used safely while driving. My search resulted in a realisation there was a big hole waiting to be filled by Speaking Email. How it worksThis app is basically an email program combined with speech synthesis. The email technology used is Context.IO and Gmail REST API. We render inline images and scale down fixed width elements to a mobile form factor using javascript and css. The app is built using html5 with Cordova. Users can swipe between emails and perform limited actions (archive, flag, quick reply, pause), intended to be easy to use and distraction free while driving. Texting and driving is a big issue and we've placed a lot of emphasis on driving safety, making sure there are no complex interactions. Your emails can be continuously spoken, meaning you never need to look at or touch the phone.Challenges I ran intoWe tried doing voice recognition and I learned heaps about phonemes and how that all works, but we came to a dead end and realise we needed to rewrite and use a different library so had to pause on that. I'm keen to get back to it but need to pace ourselves due to too much to do. Mobile development on Cordova using Windows has been difficult due to debugging tools being a bit faky and general slow code-debug-run cycle that you get with the build process. Emails are difficult to process with the many complex formats in the wild.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofGetting hot swapping of cordova code working for super fast dev-run cycle was great - annoying that we had to spend so long on tooling but good to manage to get it working well.

I thought I knew a lot already, like how inline attached emails and CIDs work, but turned out there was a bit more to it with iPhone emails being multipart mixed and still containing inline images. With gmail api you have to compose messages in raw format - base 64 with mime boundaries which I've never had to do in 20 years of programming! What's next for Speaking EmailWe've just pushed a new version to the App Store, now supporting Gmail, Outlook.com, Yahoo! Mail, iCloud, or any IMAP mail server.

"f.low","Intelligent audio level control based on the noise level of your surroundings. Enhance your listening.","[1970, ""Have you ever tried to watch a movie on the bus? Study in public? Listen to music while commuting?We're guessing you have. And, by extension, we're guessing you've had to deal with the frustrating experience of constantly adjusting the volume to accommodate for your changing environment. Everyday distractions like crying babies and noisy neighbors hinder your productivity, your patience, and the sick fiya you're dropping in your playlist -- but they no longer need to be sources of stress.What it DoesUsing the built in microphone on your Mac OS X device, f.low is able to detect how loud your environment is and dynamically adjust your volume on-the-fly, keeping your listening experience consistent.Mapping microphone input power to decibel values using our fitting algorithm, as well as letting you set a maximum and minimum volume for f.low to work with, we achieve the sound you want, all the time.How We Built Itf.low is currently available on Mac OS X, and it's just a quick and easy port away from iOS. We've developed it using Swift and Xcode, making use of the hardware existing on every Mac and iPhone.ChallengesAchieving a natural, consistent sound is key to listening experience, so great care was put into analyzing and optimizing the data gathered from the environment and achieving the most natural volume control.What's Next for f.lowOf course there is much more in store and many ideas that need exploring: further optimizing user experience, improving the validity of our detecting algorithm, and re-vamping the UI are three challenges we'd love to tackle in the future.www.justgetflow.techBuilt WithloveswiftxcodeTry it outowenkun.github.io      Submitted to    McHacks 2016    Created by  Erin HavensOwen LiSoftware Engineering MajorAnass Al "", ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['swift', 'xcode', 'love']","False","15","['owenkun', 'hellovens', 'anassinator']","https://firefly-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/usercontent/fill/242/161/cGhvdG9zL3Byb2R1Y3Rpb24vc29mdHdhcmVfdGh1bWJuYWlsX3Bob3Rvcy8wMDAvMzUyLzMyNC9kYXRhcy9vcmlnaW5hbC5qcGc=/newpost.jpg?signature=9922636f95c376e939dd0f9ce08ebcd8a92646cf","False","0"
"ZenPRM","Making Healthcare administration amazingly simple","[4873, 'The idea was born because we’ve solved similar problems for Hospital Systems, IPAs, ACOs and HIEs over the years. We started to see a lot of commonality in what they we’re collecting. Then when we got involved in NYS DSRIP, TCPI grants, etc. and it became apparent that the number of requirements were growing and getting more complex. Most importantly, we started to see providers and organizations participating in overlapping programs that needed to collect a lot of the same things from a lot of the same people. It was clear there was an issue here, so we built ZenPRM to go after it.   ', 'ZenPRM starts with the Collaborative Profile. This represents the basic demographic information about your participants\u200a—\u200aWho are they? What do they do? Where do they do it? Who do they work with? Etc. These are facts about the resources and not competitive secrets\u200a—\u200astuff that you’ll painstakingly curate and then put on the provider search on your web site. All of our customers and the participants themselves will work together to keep this information up-to-date. It ends up being a complete directory of the healthcare community you’re operating in and it’s not all on you to keep it updated. For the purposes of this challenge, we’re using the advanced search capabilities to find referral paths for patients at discharge.  One of the top predictors for hospital readmissions is whether or not the patient had an appropriate follow-up with their physician after discharge.  This makes it extremely important to get the right referral – that is one the patient has a good chance of following up with.  You may need a Spanish-speaking urologist who accepts Medicaid and is located on a bus route accessible to your patient – ZenPRM will help you find that resource on the spot. ', 'First, we took the best ideas from each of the custom network resource management solutions we had built and layered them into a single platform. Then we added configuration options to make the system flexible across the types of healthcare programs we’re seeing today and supportive of the inevitable evolution we’ll see in Alternative Payment Models in the coming years.  Finally, we conducted focus groups with industry leaders across the country to validate our ideas and assumptions. We incorporated what we learned and released version 1.  ', ""We have 3 primary challenges to deal with on this project: 1. Inspire “Coopetition” by defining a collaborative profile that was large enough to be valuable, but didn’t infringe on our customers’ ability to compete.  2. Building an extensible platform that was simple to use, but flexible enough to handle the complex requirements of today’s healthcare program and 3. Getting organizations to deal with the problem.

"PowerGlove 2.0","Get your power back","[2385, ""The inspiration for this project started from an idea for a virtual reality glove. The glove was going to be able to give feedback by using servos and wires to stop the hand from closing. Because we weren't familiar with developing through the Oculus Rift, we ventured to find other uses for this technology. We took a health approach after we realized that the glove could be used to help people who suffer from arthritis. We modified our original idea so that instead of  stopping the user from closing their hand, it records data about the movement of each finger.How it worksThe PowerGlove works by using flex sensors to measure the deflection of each finger. The data gets wirelessly transmitted to a computer which will analyze the raw data, filter through the invalid measurements, and store the data on a database. A common method physicians and doctors recommend for patients with arthritis do deal with their pain is simple hand and finger exercises. We have created a web app that walks through these exercises with the patient and records if the user can complete them. Challenges we ran intoSome challenges we ran into were figuring out how to communicate between the glove and the web server; finding how to wire the glove so that each movement could intrusively be measured with maximum accuracy.What I learnedWe learned about arthritis and the research going on being the condition; how to read from a serial port, parse the data, and write to a MySql database; and advanced soldering techniques.

"Listen","Quickly and Accurately Navigate through Audio Using Google's Powerful APIs.","[5605, 'As students in the modern age, we are inspired to combat the inefficiency of finding specific information in long audio samples. In a recorded math lecture, for example, only certain sections may be relevant to what you are trying to review. However, unlikelong text passages, there is no “command-F” that can be used to jump to the exact content needed in audio and video files. Thus, we have created an application that works as a search function for audio clips by transcribing and timestamping each spoken word. ', 'Just like the find function for web pages, PDFs, and other documents, our website implements the “command-F” functionality for audio files. The website allows for precise scrubbing of audio by prompting the user to search for a word and allowing them to freely jump between occurrences of the word in the audio and play the file from that location. The website also processes the file and extracts the top five keywords it believes the user will find most helpful to jump to using Google Cloud’s Natural Language Processing API. These suggestions act as probable topics of interests that potentially serve as valuable points of reference to the user. ', 'The web application relies primarily on the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to asynchronously transcribe audio to text while also storing the timestamp of each word. This data is stored in a Python Dictionary with the words acting as keys and a list of timestamps of the word’s occurrence as the value.. To construct the relevant suggestions that the program offers, the Google Cloud Natural Language Processing API is used to identify words from the audio with high levels of “salience.” Promoting words with higher salience over sheer frequency, we prevent the inclusion of filler or common words.APIs UsedGoogle Cloud SpeechGoogle Cloud StorageGoogle Cloud DatastoreGoogle Cloud Natural LanguageGoogle Cloud  App EngineThe front-end is two styled HTML pages, one where the user can upload a file and one where the user can see the results. When the user uploads a file, we store it in the Google Cloud Storage Datastore using an API call. A python endpoint on our Flask server (described below) then processes the audio file and returns a list of keywords and a dictionary mapping each word to a list of its start times in the audio. Next, when the user tries to search for a specific word in the audio, the program will retrieve a list containing the start times of that word in the audio and allow the user to toggle between each one, very similar to the “command-F” functionality. ', 'Although the NL API provides salience scores, some manipulations had to take place in order to make them useable. While working with the API, we were faced with the decision of whether or not to remove stopwords from the text. Stopwords are short words such as “the, at, on” which provide no real significance to the meaning of the sentence. Many NLP algorithms remove stop words to better analyze phrases.For our project, we run the NL API on two sets of the audio transcripts: one containing stopwords and one with stopwords removed. This is because, as we were testing our algorithm, we noticed the API produced significantly different results for keywords depending on whether stop words were included. Since we believed both runs had useful outputs, our final output for salience takes the top five salient words from both algorithms combined. ', 'We successfully built an application that solved a tangible issue we found. With little to no experience with APIs, we were proud to be able to create a working product using three of the Google Cloud APIs.Flask server and connectQuery Cloud datastoreDeploy first Google App Engine ', 'Over the course of 36 hours, our skills improved dramatically. We learned how to build the entire pipeline starting with creating a Google Cloud account to deploying the finished product on the Google App Engine. We also learned how to build a full stack application and integrate the front-end and back-end into a working application. Additionally, we learned how to implement control flow in HTML using Jinja2. ', 'One functionality we wanted to implement but didn’t have time for was built-in sound file conversion. Currently, our program only works with .flac files and we have to run two shell commands on any other sound type file to get it to fit our requirements. Our goal for the future is to be able to call these shell commands from within the program after the user uploads a file before it is sent to the cloud storage.We are also hoping for embedded YouTube video functionality. Instead of uploading a sound file, the user can paste a link to a YouTube video. Our software would extract the audio and process it and allow the user to essentially search the video for the word they want.Finally, our current implementation only allows for single-word search in the audio file. A relatively simple but largely helpful update would be to allow the user to search for phrases within the audio.

"WiFi Helper","Share WiFi Credentials with your guests via Alexa by showing a QR Code on Echo Show or dictating it by an Echo (dot).","[9825, 'I wrote an iOS App to share the WiFi Credentials via QR Code back in the Days of iOS 10 when it was not build-in. It does not only scan those QR Codes, it creates them and managed multiple credentials. After incorporating different technologies inside the Apple ecosystem for sharing (NFC, AirPlay, iMessage, AppleWatch), it was natural for me to build a companion skill to share the WiFi settings via Alexa. Especially the Echo Show is predestined to show the QR Code to guests. The device is always hat the location of the WiFi, while I might be away with my iPhone, when my wife wants to share your wifi with guests.But a problem e.g. on parties is, that the shown QR Code disappears after a short time - this updates brings infinite displaying the Credentials. ', 'First of all, the Skill stores the WiFi credentials.There a three options to accomplish this:I) Voice OnlyBy invoking the e.g. ""set credentials"" the skill asks for the length of the WiFi Name. Then it ask for each character separately. After the last character for the WiFi Name ii asks for the length of the WiFi Passwort and then again asks for each character separately. A character answer could be:XS: only character (this might be error-prone think about m vs. n etc.) and will be interpreted as a capital characterS: the numberM: a word and the beginning character will be used as a capital characterL: ""small"" followed by a character (same as 1, but the character will be used small)L: ""large"" followed by a character (same as 1)XL: ""small"" followed by a word (same as 3, but the character will be used small)XL: ""large"" followed by a word (same as 3)XXL: ""digit"" followed by a number (same as 2)XXXL: ""special character"" followed by the name of the special character, which should be used.II) Webpage SupportIf you ask for ""connection code"" three options bring you to a website:voice only: Alexa tells you the link ""alexa.wifi.properties"" and a user specific 6 digit code, which is valid for 15 minutes. The URL leads to a webpage, where the user enters the 6 digits and if correct, a page is presented, with two fields (name and password).card: The URL (""alexa.wifi.properties"") and 6 digits are noted on a card in the Alexa App. The card also presents a qr code, wich is a link. This link directs the user directly (skipping the page for the digit code) to the page to enter the credentials .display: On an Echo Show the QR Code, URL (""alexa.wifi.properties"") and the 6 digits are also presented on the screen.III) iOS AppAs described in ""Inspiration"" I have a companion App. This app manages WiFi Credentials. If you ask the skill for the ""iPhone App"" it will give you the URL ""http://wifi.properties"" where you can find the link to the App in the Apple App Store. On the card and an Echo Show or. Spot Display it also presents a QR Code wich will directly open the App in the App Store App.If you have the App installed, you can send any stored credentials directly to the skill. Therefore the app needs to know the Alexa UserID for invoking my Webservice - like the website (see II above). So the app extends the functionality of the ""connection code"" intent and offers different ways of integrating it:You can enter the 6 digit code in a special form inside the app, the app receives the Alexa UserID from a web service and stores it locally. You can scan the QR Code inside a special form inside the app and the app extracts the Alexa UserID directly.Both forms are special, because the user gets a special hint how to invoke the skill via a speech bubble image.The Link coded in the QR Code is registered as Universal link, if it is scanned by the iOS Camera App or the URL is entered in the Safari App, my App gets invoked and directly extract the Alexa UserID.After the Skill backend has stored the WiFi Credentials for a User, it can present thoseThe user can ask for the credential set or for a specific attribute:SSID and Password (""Alexa ask Wifi Helper for the credentials"")SSID (""Alexa ask WiFi Helper for the WiFi Name"")Password (""Alexa ask WiFi Helper for the password"")The skill spells every character in detail (like small a large b special character Dollar Digit one ...). Additionally they are also shown on a Card in the Alexa App. In the credential case, the card also includes a QR Code with the WiFi Credentials, so that it can be scanned directly.On an Echo Show and an Echo Spot the Display is used, to present the written representation of the Card and in the credential case also the QR Code.On an Echo Show or an Echo Spot the skill ask to present the QR Code infinite. If yes, an audio directive starts a silent audio stream and presents the QR Code as cover image, and the credentials as meta data text. The stream restarts after 2 1/2 minutes by adding those data to the play list. The skill uses a unique toke each time, so that it will reload the credentials if they are changed in-between. The user can directly invoke this infinite presentation by asking alexa to ""... start WiFi Helper and show credentials permanently"". The best user experience of this skill is using an Echo Show, connecting the skill to the iOS App for easy credential input and showing the credentials to guest on the Echo Show, which then uses their Smart phone (even without my App) to scan the wifi credentials QR Code and automatically get access to the WiFi. ', ""The skill Backend runs on a php server. The script uses the Alexa UserID (hashed) to create an entry in a MySQL database to store the WiFi's SSID and Password. There are different kind of scripts running on the server processing those data:Skill (plain JSON parsing and creating via PHP - just minimal code, no framework, yet)QR Code Generating (using the PHP QR Code lib) used by Skill for displaying WiFi Credentials on Display / Card or the (deep)link to the webpage.Website (just some HTML,CSS and PHP code) for browser use (also supporting universal links to deep-link into the iOS app if installed).WebServices (just some PHP code) to communicate with the AppThe iOS App is written in Swift an only uses default Frameworks of apple. For the Skill this app is extended by an upper top-left skill button in the navigation bar. This invokes an menu with the options:Enabling the skill: If Alexa app is installed, a deep link is called. Otherwise a link to the amazon skill store is invoked).Connecting via QR: Start scanner for Connection Code. On the camera image, there is a speech bubble overlay, which shows the phrase how to get the connection code from an echo show.Connection via PIN: Speech bubble, which shows the phrase how to get the PIN from an echo and a form to enter itDelete connection (if there is an active one).If an Alexa UserID is linked by QR Code or PIN, the credential detail view presents a switch. If the switch gets activated, the credentials are transferred to the WebService. On the Overview View, the credential wich is stored on the skill is marked by a grey Alexa Skill icon. "", 'The Display of the Spot created some challenges:The Display is round, so the normal QR Code would lose the corners and so the scanner could not recognize it. Solution: Added an additional boarder to avoid losing the three orientation squares.The shown text is presented over the QR Code on the Spot, so some informations are lost and the scanner sometimes cannot read the data. Solution: While generating the QR Code I use the highest quality which added redundancy so that the lose of some information can be restored. Additionally I shortend the shown text to the minimum, so less information is lost. Both solutions reduces the comeliness on an Echo Show. But it is not possible to distinguish both devices, neither by the Intent request nor by the HTTP Request of the image itself.Adapting the audio player interface to the infinity image presentation hack. This means, only using it, when display is present and some additional intents to handle stoping etc. correctly.

However, without the specific street knowledge gained from experience living in Boston, safety can be an issue not just for us but for the general populace as well.Our VisionWe hope to create an app that gathers data from police databases and utilizes historical data to display a heatmap of criminal activity in Boston. This app will then recommend safer areas for foot traffic and provide actual navigation instructions, avoiding areas of highly concentrated violent crime and drug related activities.Our ProcessWe scraped Boston Police arrest databases and gathered a dataset. Then, we utilized a deep neural network to create a model for geospatial crime frequency data, learning to predict the relative safety of a given area. The neutral network then evaluated the data on a variety of different locations in Boston and created a custom heatmap, which we then turned into a custom Google Maps overlay.ChallengesOur initial problem was the lack of uniformity in data structure between the variety of databases we scraped, forcing us to fallback on an amount of manual re-formatting and sorting. While there were optimization issues with the machine learning model, those were related to simple hyperparameter tuning and were overcome. The primary stumbling point was properly overlaying the crime data on the Maps rendering. As none of us had experience in android app development, it was hard trying to learn enough of it in time to fully carry out our vision.What’s Next?In the future, we hope to implement custom navigation instructions as well as the ability to choose different filter categories of crime.Built Withgoogle-mapskerastensorflowTry it outgitlab.com98.232.253.245      Submitted to    WHACK 2018Winner                Coding It Forward Social Impact Challenge                  Created by  I developed the machine learning regression model as well as some of the google maps API calls.Solomon GreenbergChristine LamGreg Kimatov ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['keras', 'tensorflow', 'google-maps']","False","13","['christinelam320', 'solomongreenberg', 'gkimatov']","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/717/642/datas/small.png","False","1"
"Augmented Decision Making ","A platform that offers a fair framework for decision making process by empowering individuals ","[3571, ""Social choice has received considerable attention in AI and computer science in recent years, due to technological advances that have facilitated an explosion in the availability of ranking or preference data.Despite a great degree of personalization in recommendations and information provision, tailoring alternatives presented to specific users can be difficult for a number of reasons, including infeasibility of complete personalization. Most decisions force the choice of a single option , usually from a range of choices that maximise customer satisfaction across a target market. In such settings, a single “consensus” recommendation is made for the population as a whole.In social choice theory, the Arrow's theorem states that when voters have three or more distinct alternatives , no ranked voting electoral system can convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide ranking while also meeting a specified set of criteria: unrestricted domain, non-dictatorship, Pareto efficiency, and independence of irrelevant alternativesThe proposed alternative is using a modern voting system so as to satisfy as many criteria as possible, while considering the participatory democracy concept: involving users in the decision making process and focusing on their participation and collaboration "", 'Our platform offers users a middle ground between fully personalised choices and pure consensus recommendations in the process of decision making.The platform is an integrated part of the Mirro product and aims to benefit organisations by empowering individual employees in the fair-decision making process implied by a participatory democracy: problem identificationdebate , ideation and co-creationdrafting proposalsvoting checking that the solution has been properly deployed and actually solves the identified problem.The process aims to determine a collection of candidates that best represent the “collective interests” of the voters, by using a modern voting system, selectable by problem authors when defining the problem.

"LiveBus","Crowd-Sourced location sharing platform to provide accurate public transport location data to users","[4187, 'Public transport systems have many struggles. But for most, the biggest struggle is the uncertainty behind not having accurate information location on how far their next bus is. While some systems do implement their own GPS tracking systems, this would need a different bus app to be downloaded for each system and most systems do not even have GPS tracking. As students we use buses to get around campus all the time and need accurate location data to know whether it will come in time for class. Hence we created LiveBus to solve a widespread struggle for all Public Transport users. ', ""LiveBus utilised the powerful here.com api to load the map as well as automatically fetch the bus routes in the city based on the user's current location. The app then allows the user to select a specific bus route and see the next bus based on crowd sourced data. They will also see the path that the bus is taking to reach the user. When the bus finally arrives, the user can instantly board the bus and act as a tracker for others to see until they get off their next stop. The app checks for clusters of trackers so that the user waiting at the bus station can understand the reliability of the location data. The trackers can also indicate how crowded the bus is. Lastly the app acts sets up a medium of communication between those on the bus and those waiting to allow those waiting on the bus to get information about the status of the bus in case it has broken down or is stuck in a traffic jam.  "", ""The core of the app powerfully uses the here.com api to power the map as well as all the routes and bus stations. Then, using the web-geolocation api, we added the user's live location to the map gotten from here.com. Google cloud was used for data storage and vue.js was used to implement material design to make the UI look good and simple the use. Many web services then complemented the app to power the backend to connect the trackers with those waiting for the bus station.  "", 'One of the conceptual challenges was in whether the users would track the bus for others. We realised that we needed to make it extremely easy to start tracking once the user boards the bus to we did exactly that. We also took inspiration from apps like waze where people provide information like traffic cameras and crash data for others with no remuneration. However we conceptualised a points system that they can get based on the time they have been tracking and redeem the points for rewards towards companies partnered with the app. Programatically, one of the biggest challenges was making a progressive web app that can work despite all the security issues involved during development. Also integrating the powerful here.com api and using all its features took time to learn and implement but we were able to make it fully functional in the end.  ', ""We're proud of the fact that LiveBus is actually fully functional. It can get the routes using the user's current location. Allows the user to select which route they want to track. Shows other users on a bus and their route to the user. And of course, looks good and works well on mobile. It is essentially fully capable of being deployed. We are also proud of the fact that this tool can be used all around the world.  "", 'We learnt how to integrate the here.com api to work with a progressive web app and the powerful web tools that allow us to do so.

The glasses vibrate when your eyes close for too long, and also causes your Pebble watch to vibrate. How it was builtDigitalCoffee was built with an arduino, photon, pebble, and android phone. The arduino processes all of the information, and the photon uploads the information to a server. The server sends data to your phone, which in turn forwards the data via bluetooth to the pebble. The IR sensors detect eye movement - blink frequency and duration. There is also a tilt sensor to detect head motion. The vibration motors trigger as long as the sensors detect signs of sleeping. The blink information is forwarded to the phone app for analytics; one can see when he/she is most sleepy. Lastly, the pebble app displays raw values and alerts you via vibration/notification.The glasses were designed and 3d printed. We used multiple breadboards, wires, and parts to do everything. Also included: a button to calibrate the IR sensors.Challenges we ran intoGetting all the hardware to work properly. The biggest challenge was getting the photon to accept and transmit data from the Arduino Uno. We ran into some serious problems with transmission using RX and TX pins, but we were able to use I2C instead. It would have been much harder without Pennapps' great mentors. The hardware was also hard to calibrate as there were multiple issues with sensitivity.

"Tunnel Comet","pass through like comet goes","[6118, ""The Hsuehshan Tunnel is the main artery between Taipei and Yilan, but it can be severely clogged. After researching, our team found there are two main reasons that cause the traffic congestion in Hsuehshan Tunnel. One is there's no tool for drivers to measure interval from the front vehicle objectively. Drivers usually keep too long interval to avoid breaking the laws. It lead to decrease of car flow in Hsuehshan Tunnel. The other is some drivers driving at improper speed results in clogging up traffic behind them and decrease average driving speed. Hence, we try to design a system that can solve the problems and increase car flow and average driving speed in Hsuehshan Tunnel.雪山隧道是連結台北與宜蘭的主要幹道，但令人煩惱的是它常常有嚴重塞車的情形。經過研究後我們發現有兩個主要原因造成雪山隧道的交通壅塞，第一個是因為駕駛沒有客觀工具可以判斷和前車的車距，因此駕駛很容易為了不要觸法而拉長車距，而導致雪山隧道的單位時間車流量減少，另一個原因是有些駕駛會開在不適當的速度(烏龜車)，堵住了後方的車輛，導致後方所有車輛的平均車速降低。因此，我們想要設計一套系統來解決這些問題，提升雪山隧道內的單位時間車流量和平均車速。 "", 'Tunnel Comet provide visualized guides for drivers in Hsuehshan Tunnel to drive properly. It would base on the conditions around the vehicle and show appropriate visualized guide in front of the vehicle to suggest driver to accelerate, decelerate or maintain current speed. By guiding drivers driving at optimal speed and interval, Tunnel Comet leads to significant improvement in traffic. The efficiency is proved in simulation system.Since all vehicle would pass through the tunnel with visualized guide in front just like comet goes. Hence we named this system “Tunnel Comet”.雪隧彗星提供駕駛視覺導航，來幫助駕駛能更適當的行車。它會根據車輛附近的情況，在車輛前方提示出適當的視覺引導，來建議駕駛加速、減速或維持目前速度。藉由引導駕駛在最佳的速度和車距行車，雪隧彗星大幅改善了交通狀況，它的效益已在模擬系統中證實。由於所有的車輛在穿過隧道時，都會有視覺導航一直在前方，就像彗星要離去的樣貌，因此我們把這套系統命名為—雪隧彗星。 ', 'Simulation System:In the beginning, we try to prove the efficiency of Tunnel Comet. We built a simulation system in unity which has two-lane traffic in the tunnel. Both lane is simulated with AI cars running on it, while one lane is normal road and the other lane is Tunnel Comet road. Tunnel Comet road is setting up sensors to detect car pass through and light patterns to serve as visualized guides. By this design, user can carry out the comparison between normal road and Tunnel Comet road. Furthermore, the simulation system has two mode – God mode and player mode. In God mode, user can observe whole tunnel in god view and see the objective traffic statistics of each lane. In player mode, user can experience the driving in first person view and even VR(virtual reality) view if user has VR glasses. These two mode also allow us to make sure the strategy of Tunnel Comet is appropriate and the driving experience is comfortable.Prototype:After proving the efficiency of Tunnel Comet, we built a prototype of Tunnel Comet road. It contains four ultrasonic ranging modules and three LED lights to form a segment of road. We used an Arduino board to connect all components and implement same strategy algorithm as simulation system on it.模擬系統:首先，我們為了驗證雪隧彗星的效益，我們用Unity製作了一套模擬系統，裡面的隧道有雙線道，兩個線道都會人工智慧車輛在上面行駛，而兩個線道一個分別為普通道路，一個被製作為雪隧彗星道路，雪隧彗星道路設置了很多感測器來偵測通過車輛和特殊圖案來做為視覺導航，藉由這個設計，使用者可以清楚地對普通道路和雪隧彗星道路進行比較，此外，模擬系統有兩種模式，分別為上帝模式和玩家模式，在上帝模式，使用者可以以上帝視角觀察整個隧道，並且有兩個線道客觀的交通數據供審視，在玩家模式，使用者可以以第一人稱視角體驗行車，甚至若使用者有虛擬實境眼鏡，甚至可以虛擬實境視角體驗行車，這兩個模式讓我們可以確保雪隧彗星的策略是適當的，並且行車體驗是舒適的。硬體雛型:在驗證雪隧彗星的效益之後，我們製作了雪隧彗星道路的雛型，它由四個超音波測距模組和三個LED燈構成一段道路，我們用Arduino電路板統合這些組件，並在上面實作和模擬系統一樣的策略演算法。 ', ""Although the concept of Tunnel Comet is simple, but the appropriate guiding strategy must be well-designed. At first we found that too simple or sensitive design could cause Bullwhip effect in traffic. The guiding strategy must avoid providing improper acceleration and deceleration guides and should be capable of absorb Bullwhip effect. While designing the guiding strategy, we have to consider not only the interval but also the relative speed of the vehicles. Another challenge is how to design appropriate visualized guide patterns. Improper guide patterns design like not intuitive, too complicated or flashing would not only cause misunderstanding, but also lead to distraction and even dizziness.雖然雪隧彗星的概念很簡單，但實際上適當的導航策略需要很完善的設計，起初我們發現太簡單的設計或太敏感的設計都會造成交通狀況上的長鞭效應，導航策略必須避免不適當的引導加速和減速，並且要有能力吸收長鞭效應，因此在設計導航策略的時候，我們不只需要考量車距問題，還需要考量車輛彼此的相對速度。另一個挑戰是對於視覺導航圖形的設計，不適當的設計，例如不直覺、太複雜或閃爍等，除了可能造成誤解，還可能造成分心甚至暈眩。Accomplishments that we’re proud of1.Think up an excellent solution to improve the traffic in Hsuehshan Tunnel.2.Build a powerful simulation system which prove the efficiency of Tunnel Comet, and also serve as a perfect platform for us to test the guiding strategy and driving experience.3.Build a prototype with complete function by hardware component.4.Give this system a cool name – “Tunnel Comet”5.Work as perfect team and have a lot of fun1.發想出一個出色的解決方案來改善雪山隧道內的交通狀況。2.製作一套強大的模擬系統，驗證了雪隧彗星的效應，同時也作為一個完美的平台讓我們可以測試導航策略和行車體驗。3.製作一個功能齊全的硬體雛型。4.為這個系統取一個很酷的名字—“雪隧彗星”5.做為一個完美的團隊一起完成這項作品，並得到很多樂趣。What we learned1.Designing an excellent system requires comprehensive consideration in every detail.2.Knowledge about traffic congestion.3.Technique in developing system with Unity and Arduino1.設計一個出色的系統，需要在每個細節上的周全考量。2.關於交通壅塞的知識3.使用Unity和Arduino開發系統的技術What's next for Tunnel Comet1.Keep improving guiding strategy and visualized guide patterns design of Tunnel Comet.2.Apply the concept to urban traffic and develop other vehicle locating and guiding technology that can cooperate with current system.

"wells","Wells is a smart bottle cap that tracks your water intake, boosting your well-being one drop at a time.","[2742, 'wells is a brainchild of a group of friends from Imperial College London and UCL. Being passionate about innovations in health tech and quantified self, we were surprised by how little our increasingly health-conscious society knows about one of the key parts of lifestyle - water intake. Drinking enough water is essential for maintaining our health and overall well-being. However, many people either do not realize the importance of water intake or simply do not know how much they should drink. Dehydration can contribute to an array of medical complications. Drinking enough water helps a balanced body and mind, making hydration equally important for athletes, scholars and patients alike. ', 'wells consists of two components: the smart bottle cap fitting every standard PET bottle and a smartphone app. Using the wells app, user is provided with a recommended water intake for the day based on their personal metrics and current activity levels. The autonomous cap measures the amount of water that flows out through its seal and data is collected and displayed via the app. The user can see their progress and receive push notifications reminding them to follow the recommended intake.  ', ""The measurement is compromised by a specifically developed cap to suit every PET plastic bottle. In its inner canal an adapted mechanical turbine is located to provide data about speed of flow of liquid.

"SAN - Soil Analyzer Network","Simple, extendable, scalable monitoring solution","[6281, ""California is the largest economy in the United States, it accounts for more than 13% of its gross state product (GSP) and by itself it's comparable to the many countries of the world. Its agriculture is a very important, multibillion dollar sector that consists of more than 75 000 farms and ranches that have been hurt by the recent droughts. To help fight the droughts modern day farms use large irrigation systems with vast water requirements. Smart management of this precious resource is a must.Luckily, with today’s technologies we can hack the solution. "", 'The challenge is to help mitigate California\'s water crisis by using smart interconnected devices or with what is commonly known as Internet of Things. We have come up with a solution that optimizes water consumption of the irrigation systems with the goal to reduce overall strain on this precious resource.Our solution consists of two parts, low power soil moisture sensor probes that are scattered across the field, and cloud computing. By using a simple wireless communication protocol, probes aggregate information about certain sectors of the farm\'s soil and propagate information to Samsung Artik. There, the data is analyzed and used to control the irrigation system, while offering the farmer complete control and overview. Additionally, nodes are based on low power microcontroller that collects the data from capacitive moisture sensor. They are solar powered with battery backup. Data can be propagated from the farthest to the closets node by using a mesh networking algorithm. This setup allows us to build scalable solution which can be custom fitted for a wide range of cases.Our user interface is implemented by using Web 2.0 technologies. We are using Google Maps, Javascript API on the frontend part of the application to show soil sensors as individual markers on the map. They are updated dynamically to show real time information about the field. By using Samsung Artik IOT solutions we can unlock new possibilities and build scalable and complex systems with ease.

"Smart Floating Farm","Cultivate the future, start from the sea","[9971, 'We want to help peopleWe see that local people in Coastal area and Remote Islands having difficulty in planting horticulture because they face the problem of land limitations. We have an idea about making floating platform so people can grow their vegetables at coastal area.We inspired by GROASIS, Seawater Greenhouse, and Hamster Ball-Shaped Solarball. They can grow plants at desert area and have a pure water using desalination process.Hopefully this platform can help local people to reduce their dependence on supply from mainland, help them make their own food independence and also help to make more money from selling the harvest vegetables. We also can manage these process with supllying seed, provide consultation to user, and preparing the market to sell the vegetables. ', 'SMART FLOATING FARM (SFF) PLATFORM BUILD TO RECORD, MONITOR, AND MAKE DECISION BASED ON THE RECORD.Initialize sensors and outputThis platform will initialize serial, lcd, RTC (real time clock), sensors, and motor. If RTC cannot be detected, LCD will display error and user must fix it. After RTC is ok, Arduino101 will check communication with ESP8266. Arduino101 send ""AT"" and wait ""OK"" from ESP8266.Get threshold from ServerAfter receiving ""OK"", Arduino will command ESP8266 as station mode and get parameter threshold from Server.  These threshold value used to ensure plants are in the range that has been determined by the user. SFF send GET method to server (This link used to receive sensors threshold). Parameter threshold will be saved as variable.Sensor MeasurementThis platform record these parameters : soil moisture & temperature, greenhouse temperature & humidity, greenhouse smoke detection, vibration, plant height, time, and light intensity.Sending Data to ServerData from sensor compiled as String and send it to Web by ESP8266 using POST method (Go to this link to send data to WebServer; Visit this link to see data that received by WebServer from Platform).Output ActionArduino101 check data measurement with threshold received from Server. Based on these threshold, platform will give command automatically to activate LED indicator, water pump, exhaust fan and LED lamps based on sensors reading. After 10 seconds, platform will delay few minutes before the next measurement. While waiting, Arduino101 measure gyro value.Smart Floating Farm DashboardUser can see data send to Server using this dashboard. This dashboard will give all information from sensor graphically. All data can be found at irwanrudy github repo.Smart Floating Farm Dashboard/GUI ', 'Google SketchUpGoogle SketchUp used to make the platform 3D design. We have made 3D model of Smart Floating Farm. We simplify our model for Intel hackathon.Smart Floating Farm 3D DesignWe make dashboard with HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. To add style we use Bootstrap and make interactive chart use Highcharts. We make it eye-catching for everyone that using the dashboard. FritzingFritzing used for the design of electronics hardware to support us in sensors configuration with Arduino101. We used internal and external libraries to make this visualization.Smart Floating Farm Sensors and Outputs Configuration-Fritzing designArduino IDEWe use Arduino IDE to built the firmware. We use libraries from internal Arduino IDE and from internet. For external library, we used  SEEED RGB LCD , Adafruit DHT11 , Adafruit RTC , Adafruit ADS1115 , MQ02 Gas Sensor, Dallas DS18B20 , Rotation from Gyro & Accelerometer, Time Alarm , and Time Lib . For internal library, we used Wire, pitches.h, CurieIMU and Software Serial. We used Mario Bros Tune developed by Dipto Pratyaksa to play sound at the beginning. IMU rotation angle we got from Erikyo. SFF Arduino sketch can be found at MANTIS GITHUB.Eagle LayoutWe build our own shield to make easier in pin connection. We used Eagle Software to build the schematic and board..Smart Floating Farm Custom Shield ', ""When we start submit our idea to Intel, we decide to use SIM900 GSM Module because we have some problem with ESP8266. As time goes by, we facing problem with Software Serial communication between SIM900 and Arduino101. SIM900 using 5 volt in communication and Arduino101 using 3.3 volt. We thought this difference in voltage maybe the main problem why Software Serial wasn't work. After that, we decide switch to ESP8266. We used Custom ESp8266 module from GeraiCerdas named MCCloud. ESP8266 using 3.3 volt as main voltage, same with Arduino101. But Unfortunately, we still facing the same problem. We tried to solve this problem by searching in the internet but no luck. Suddenly, we tried switch the keyword from Arduino101 to Arduino Due. Voila, we got the solution. We add pinMode (rx, INPUT) and pinMode (tx, OUTPUT) to ensure Software Serial works.We also encountered problem with relay. We used this relay. The problem is relay must powered by 5 volt so relay can switch from OFF to ON. we come with solution using pinMode (relay_pin, INPUT) and connect one relay pin to 5 volt and the other to Arduino101 Digital Pin. With pinMode we ensure that the voltage through relay will 5 volt.Sometimes, we connect sensor wrong so we must soldered again. We tried to write down in a paper the wire color and the pin, so we can remember and not wrong soldering the sensor.Arduino101 have problem when we upload the firmware. We often press MASTER_RESET button to upload the firmware. Arduino101 also must powered by adapter before connect it to computer. We experience our Arduino101 died and cannot recognized by computer. We dont know the fault because we never did something wrong to Arduino101. We think it is because the board. Board getting hot when we connect it to adapter. But, after we have another Arduino101, it is OK until right now.We encountered challenge to understand AT Command from ESP8266. Article from luciorocha, alselectro, fuho, Electrodragon, and ReiLabs very helpfull to make us understand how to use ESP8266. Before we connect ESP8266 with Arduino101, we tried AT Command using UART to TTL adapter.UART to TTLTrying GET and POST method was very challenging because we must communicate between Arduino division and IT division to decide the link for getting threshold and sending data.Arduino101 cannot use every external exist library in the internet. We came with problem when we use custom/indie library such as DS1307 library and I2C LCD 16x2.IMU Arduino101 must be updated all time. When we tried to make delay about five minutes, Arduino101 cant get the gyro real value. So we decide to read gyro value in the delay time to ensure we get the right gyro value.For dashboard challenge is make live chart using Highcharts. Because the technology is new for us, so we need to learn deeply to make it live. It can be see at SFF dashboard. "", 'We able to understand and using ESP AT Command using GET and POST method.We able to use Arduino101 Internal IMU.

"Fish-o-Tron","An end-to end solution for easily measuring &amp; tracking fish!","[3060, ""After reading the problem statement and chatting to Harry yesterday, who has worked in Fisheries for several years, we realised that there was a pressing need for a faster way to measure and record information about fish. The current procedure involves manually measuring several properties, recording the data offline, and then manually transcribing it into a spreadsheet for data analysis. We knew there had to be a better way.How it worksBy using state of the art computer vision technology, we are able to measure the length of a fish placed on our special board by using an overhead camera. Using this technique, and by averaging multiple readings and rejecting anomalies, we can obtain an average accuracy of +-5mm, which much better than the vast majority of manual readings, and significantly faster [approximately 1 second measurement time per fish]. We automatically upload this information to a public website which we have developed (visible here: http://fishotron.fyquah.me/ ) , where people can see information about the fish, as well as edit it. This enables simple, real-time auditing from interested organisations, as well as an easy way to increase engagement with the public, as they can discover just where their fish came from, using uploaded GPS data.Challenges and solutionsComputer vision is difficult! We initally tried to create tracking points (known as 'fiducial markers') by hand, and then identify them. However this was extremely challenging, and did not allow us to differentiate separate tracking points. By switching to using an external library, integrated into our code, we can very precisely track the location, rotation, ID and skew of multiple points in real time - allowing our software to work, even when the camera is not precisely positioned over the paper.Accomplishments that we are proud ofLearning to use OpenCV was great fun - it's a beautifully designed library, with a host of awesome features.

"LSDai","Earn Compound interest with your rDai collateral, while providing liquidity for hedges against variable Compound interest. Get high on interest! ","[6098, 'In a world of roller-coaster crypto volatility, we turned to Dai for stability. With the emergence of interest generating instruments born through layers of collateralization on crypto native synthetic assets, we are entering a phase of interest rate volatility. Introducing LSDai, for your escape to a peace of mind: earn Compound interest on your collateral with rDai, while providing liquidity for hedges against variable Compound interest.  Empirical studies from traditional finance have shown the adverse impact of variability in interest rates (the “price” of money) on the real economy. Accordingly, interest rate swap, used by non-financial firms in the management of the interest rate risk of their debt, is one of the most important fixed-income instrument in the trading and hedging of interest rate risk. An alternative to interest rate swap, Eurodollar futures, is the biggest and most liquid futures market traded in the US by volume. We have seen recent wild swings of Compound interest on Dai, going from 5% to peaking over 16% within a month. With the emergence of DeFi stack, more synthetic crypto assets composed of native assets are created and then rebundled on the Ethereum tech stack, enabling new possibilities while introducing complex interdependencies into the system. This is why we are creating LSDai.market, for hedgers and speculators to take leveraged long and short positions on Dai interest rates without borrowing by simply buying and selling LongDi and ShortDi tokens. ', 'LSDai creates a Euro-dollar like construct, that is a future on the Compound Dai lending rate over the duration of the contract. By leveraging Market Protocol which takes on the approach of constructing index futures via ""iron-cross options"" approach, LSDai de-couples the risk of the two sides via long and short position tokens.It enables three different types of users to gain the kind of exposure to the interest rate fluctuation that fits their profile, while aligns incentives.Hedgers: Hedgers are lending out their Dai on Compound and earn interest, but fear that the interest rate — thus, their passive revenue — will drop. LSDai’s Market Makers mint and sell them short Dai interest tokens for Dai, in the amount that will completely hedge their interest-earning position. This means they will experience no fluctuation: if the interest rate drops, the profit from the short will make them even, and if the rate goes up, the extra interest makes up for their loss. Hedgers can insure themselves against loss of income.Speculators: These players have no stake in the lending business, they just want to speculate on the changes in the interest rate. Bettors expect Dai’s lending interest rate on Compound to go up or down, and buy long or short Dai interest tokens from the LSDai Market Makers for Dai. They either gain or lose money, depending on where the interest rate goes… and how clear their mind was when they made their bet.Market makers: Market makers manage the minting and selling of the long or short Dai interest tokens ', 'We took a decentralized approach, adopting Market Protocol in decoupling the interest rate swap positions into margin-embedded Long and Short position tokens. We used Airswap to find the price of the Long ad Short position tokens. Given the importance of liquidity in the model, we programmed a bot to arbitrage away the spread across the Market Makers (Minters) of the token pairs and the Hedgers/Speculators.Lastly, in order to create virtuous loop to further incentivize the Market Makers, we implemented rDai as the collateral in Market Protocol in Minting of the position pair. Thus, Market Makers will be able to earn interest from the rDai collateral, in addition to earning the spread.For this hackathon, we are able to start from scratch and launch our LSDai on Ethereum Main Net. Since we are the first Market Maker in this product, we have decided to donate the interest accrued from rDai in the collateral to EthBerlin.  ', 'Figure out how to take a contract that is written to provide assets priced in dollars and invent a pricing structure for the interest rate swap, and how the pricing structure may fit into the existing Market Protocol smart contract that we have already deployed on Kovan. We encountered a hard coded Infura key that hit its rate limit today in the Airswap widget, and the widget code is not open sourced.

This involved creating a classification system for the change in an index for a given day, and a Twitter scraper that downloads the President's tweets. Next, we paired each of our tweets with the classification from the day that the tweet was published, rebalanced our training data, and uploaded it to Google AutoML for training. Once the training is done, our React.js frontend and Node.js backend allow the user to use the model to predict changes and visualize the result.

Setting caps on the number of training samples for each category helped us resolve this, however we have a lot to learn.Finally, all four of us are new to JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, and machine learning so we were challenged by the fact that we needed to teach ourselves and each other about the tools we were using as we were using them, all while making sure that we are making progress at an appropriate pace.

Getting higher API limits and permissions will allow us to collect a more meaningful number of Trump tweets and it may also allow us to return to our original goal of using news headlines to make predictions.

Deepfakes are a new method to impersonate famous figures saying fictional things, and could be particularly influential in the outcome of this and future elections. With international misinformation becoming more common, we wanted to develop a level of protection and reality for users. Facebook's Deepfake Detection Challenge, which aims to crowdsource ideas, inspired us to approach this issue. "", 'Our Chrome extension processes the current video the user is watching. The video is first scanned using AWS to identify the politician/celebrity in subject. Knowing the public figure allows the app to choose the model trained by machine learning to identify Deepfakes targeting that specific celebrity. The result of the deep fake analysis are then shown to the user through the chrome extension, allowing the user to see in the moment whether a video might be authentic or forged.Our Web app offers the same service, and includes a prompt that describes this issue to users. Users are able to upload a link to any video they are concerned may be tampered with, and receive a result regarding the authenticity of the video. ', ""We used the PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to build the model by hand, and broke down the video into one second frames. Previous research has evaluated the mouths of the deepfake videos, and noticed that these are altered, as are the general facial movements of a person. For example, previous algorithms have looked at mannerisms of politicians and detected when these mannerisms differed in a deepfake video. However, this is computationally a very costly process, and current methods are only utilized in a research settings.Each frame is then analyzed with six different concavity values that train the model. Testing data is then used to try the model, which was trained in a Linear Kernel (Support Vector Machine). The Chrome extension is done in JS and HTML, and the other algorithms are in Python.The testing data set is comprised from the user's current browser video, and the training set is composed of Google Images of the celebrity.

', 'We are proud to have created our own model and make the ML algorithm work! It was very satisfying to see the PCA clusters, and graph the values into groups within the Support Vector Machine. Furthermore, getting each of the components ie, Flask and Chrome extension to work was gratifying, as we had little prior experience in regards to transferring data between applications. We are able to successfully determine if a video is a deep fake, and notify the person in real time if they may be viewing tampered content!

"", 'Train the model with more celebrities and get the chrome extension to output whether the videos in your feed are DeepFakes or not as you scroll. Specifically, this would be done by decreasing the run time of the machine learning algorithm in the background. Although the algorithm is not as computationally costly as conventional algorithms created by experts, the run time barrs exact real-time feedback within seconds. We would also like to use the Facebooks DeepFake datasets when they are released.Specifically, deepfakes are more likely to become a potent tool of cyber-stalking and bullying in the short term, says Henry Ajder, an analyst at Deeptrace.

The input nodes for the network take the duration and frequency of the preceding 5 notes as well as the current note, the preceding 3 chord progressions, and the corresponding note on the other clef. The output nodes produce the duration and frequency of the next note in the sequence, which is fed back as an input for the subsequent note. ', ""There is one neural network for the treble clef (right hand) and one for the bass clef (left hand). This is because the higher right hand notes often play a unique melody, while the lower left hand notes are often repeated, slower chords. I wanted to make sure these two very separate styles of music didn't confuse the neural network.  "", 'The biggest challenge is that feeding outputs back into the neural network will cause the network to converge. In the beginning, my compositions often converged to a single, repeating note. This produced extremely boring music. I fixed this by introducing mutations to the network. First I tried to sample a Gaussian distribution based on the mean and standard deviation of the error vectors. Then, I switched to a small percentage of changing the note by a perfect fifth or a perfect octave, both of which do not affect the flow of the music much. Furthermore, both the treble and bass clefs converged to the same note. I fixed this problem by splitting the the network in two, as mentioned earlier. Finally, neural networks do not give very exact predictions. Unfortunately, in music, even the slightest deviation will cause the music to sound out of tune. I often had quarter tones and random durations of notes. I fixed this by rounding the pitch and duration, which significantly increased the quality of the music. ', ""I'm proud of having done this project alone. I've been to a lot of hackathons in past years, but always under the tutelage of upperclassmen. Now that they've graduated, I'm sort of wondering on my own. I'm glad I was able to accomplish this project without others directing me. I'm also proud of how far I came with this project. I compared my first generated sonata to my most recent one and I was really impressed with how good the latter one sounded. Perhaps not yet at the level of Mozart, but it's certainly come a long way.  "", ""Music is hard! 36 hours is not enough to create an algorithm that can generate music that has been endeared for centuries. I have a much greater appreciation (but also greater frustration...).Python is incredible. Technically, I already knew this, but to be able to produce this quality of a music generating, machine learning algorithm in under 250 lines is incredible. Yes, I only wrote 250 [very well thought out and tested via trial and error!] lines. Python is life.I was also introduced to pybrain and music21, Python libraries used for neural networks and analyzing music, respectively. Both of these are very well made and I hope I have an opportunity to explore more of their features in future projects.Also, I had to learn a lot of stat. It was pretty uncomfortable, and I'm not a fan... "", ""Obviously, more fine tuning of parameters in order to produce even more beautiful music. While I did consider chords in the neural network, harmony is probably the most important missing feature. Harmony analysis is a 36 hour project on its own, and would greatly improve the project. In addition, I'm hoping to expand to concertos and contemporary music. Sonatas are fairly easier because they are generally piano only, with only a left and right hand. Opening to more types of music would be very fun.PS. Unfortunately, I have no pictures! There's not much to show about a neural network... However, 10 MIDI files of varying quality can be found on the Github.

Through this unique set of tools, our users’ most cherished and valued memories can be brought to life and forever preserved in the form of beautiful hardbound books.History & TeamJRNL launched a Beta offering in October of 2015.  To date, it has registered just over 65,000 users who, in turn, have created over one million unique posts.  It\'s important to note that the product is ""in the wild"" and we are iterating and making improvements based upon user feedback.The platform is supported by an experienced team of developers and operators, with multiple successful ventures, numerous industry awards (over 40 combined), and well over $4 Billion in value created.Key members include:Nick Jones - Founder, Lead Visionary   16+ Years Management, Marketing & Operations Experience    Brand Consultant to Wrangler, Special Olympics & Mandalay ResortsSteve Reed - Co-Founder, Lead Designer   13+ Years Branding and Graphic / Web Design Experience   Past work recognized by Wired and MSNBCJay Goodwin - Chief Architect   16+ Years Senior Software Development Experience    Previous teams have won dozens of industry awardsGlenn Argenbright - Advisor & Board Member   19+ Years Executive Experience   Six High Value Exits as Founder or CEO – 3 IPOs / 3 AcquisitionsHow it was builtOur product team consists of seven designers and developers working out of two distinct locations, separated by a two hour time differential.  Fortunately, the team was broken into two groups, each with a unique set of skills and responsibilities.  One team focused on backend processes and all Web application development, while the other team focused on Mobile development and front-end UI design.  This allowed us to minimize the impact of working with two remote development teams. The remote nature of the team also impacted certain design decisions.  Realizing that we wanted multi-platform compatibility and a consistent user experience, we decided to go with a microservices based architecture.  The Web platform was originally built as a single page application, using the React Javascript Framework.  The app communicates with the Web Server via http and https calls, to a Django based backend.  For mobile, we originally used Xamarin Forms, communicating via http and https to the same backend as our Web application.  We will likely move away from Xamarin in the future.For data storage, we use a mix of three technologies.  Specifically, MariaDB, Elasticsearch, and Redis.  We opted to use a cloud based hosting provider, so that we could rapidly scale resources as needed, and to reduce ongoing operational overhead.Challenges We EncounteredTeam:  Operating remote teams presents numerous challenges.  We’ve had to work hard to avoid or minimize communication breakdowns, scheduling misunderstandings (due to time zones), unclear design requirements, poor prioritization, faulty expectations, focus drift, feature creep, and overall clarity of the product vision.  Additionally, team members varied significantly in terms of both overall experience and technical knowledge, which was only amplified by the remote nature of our work environments.  This necessitated additional time for training and education, as well as a more structured communication methodology.Tech:  On the Web app side, the choice of React was a risk due to its relative lack of maturity as a platform, combined with our own learning curve and an associated lack of available documentation, best practices, and other materials relating to the platform.  As an example, we initially chose to use the React Flux framework provided by Facebook, combined with datastore and API abstraction libraries with which we were already familiar.  This proved challenging, because the tools lacked maturity, and because we were attempting to use old methodologies (depending on old libraries), rather than leveraging the various benefits inherent in React.  After a few false starts, we settled on Redux as a full replacement for all existing datastores, which proved prescient given that the React community has now, for the most part, settled on Redux as a best practices approach.Product:  Initially, we designed the product as a single-user private journaling tool but, as the product progressed, we recognized a real need for private, semi-public and public journals, offering the ability to share content and collaborate with others, in order to create a more complete record.  However, through this process, we soon learned that sharing and collaboration, at least in terms of journaling, is not nearly as simple and obvious as initially thought.  One obvious challenge revolves around content ownership.  In a private journal, it is quite obvious who owns the content, but that understanding breaks down as soon as you share the content with others and allow them to contribute to the journal.  As an example, if I invite Sally to collaborate on a specific event or entry, who then owns the content - both of us, neither, me, or Sally?  Taking this even further, if I invite her to collaborate on my journal, can she then invite others to collaborate as well?  When we first started talking about sharing, we found that each person looked at it differently, depending on their experience.  Some focused on social sharing (Facebook and other social networks), some focused on permission-based sharing (Dropbox), and still others focused on email or other legacy-based sharing options (forums, listservs, etc.).  In fact, it’s become clear to us that journaling presents its own challenges with respect to both sharing and collaboration, and we had to create rules and functionality to account for each of the three paradigms mentioned above, while at the same time making sure that our users understand the implications of such actions with regards to their content.Accomplishments We\'re Proud OfThere are many things that we’re proud of as a team.  For the most part, such items can be broken out into two categories - inward facing, “operational” issues, and outward facing, “product” issues.Operational items include:   The successful management of remote development teams   The ability to attract “top tier” talent on a limited budget   The ability to address and account for complex sharing issues far beyond other offerings   That we’ve remained true to our core principals.  We always respect user privacy, even when looking at concepts such as sharing and collaboration.  This is very different from Facebook and other well-known social platformsProduct items include:   The knowledge that we’ve helped many families capture their history and produce books creating a generational link for the future   The creation of unique habit building tools, and their impact on journaling (as evidenced by the total volume of posts created)   The many ways we’ve simplified and made journaling more accessibleWhat We LearnedMost of what we’ve learned thus far is the direct result of user feedback.  Through research, surveys, and unsolicited user comments, we know there is a great demand for reminders, prompts and other tools to maximize the journaling experience.  In fact, habit creation tools and other prompts to battle writer’s block, and to encourage daily activity, are among the most often requested items from our users. We’ve also learned that this is a complex problem.  This explains why existing solutions continue to struggle when it comes to addressing key areas of concern.  This fact is further complicated by the reality that any associated product must be easy to use - otherwise, users won’t journal on a regular basis.  However, as one might expect, building simple solutions for complex problems is no small task.  We believe that current rates of user adoption (65k+ beta users) and high levels of daily engagement (1M+ posts), show that we’re on the right path.What\'s Next For JRNL?As noted above, we are currently expanding our sharing and collaboration toolsets.  In addition, we plan to greatly expand our current “habit building tools,” offering specialized categories and subcategories so that users can customize the prompts they are likely to see.  This work will also tie in to customized journaling types and templates (camping, cooking, travel, fitness, diet, etc.).  We are also looking at ways that people might contribute to journals through voice / text transcription through the mobile app (or via a microphone).  We also plan to add various legacy components in 2016, allowing users to send individual messages (or complete journals) to friends and family members at some predetermined date in the future (or upon the completion of certain triggering events).Built Withdjangoelasticsearchmariadbnode.jsreactredisreduxxamarinTry it outwww.jrnl.com      Submitted to    RootsTech Innovator Showdown    Created by  Brand, project creation, fund raising, team building, management, and every other hat that goes with a startup.Nick JonesBranding, web design, UX/UI, front-end development, and marketing materials for JRNL.Steve ReedJay GoodwinAmy VelozJay Goodwin ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['react', 'django', 'node.js', 'mariadb', 'elasticsearch', 'redis', 'xamarin', 'redux']","False","10","['jrnl', 'nickjones', 'notjay', 'amyveloz', 'stev3reed']","https://firefly-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/usercontent/fill/242/161/cGhvdG9zL3Byb2R1Y3Rpb24vc29mdHdhcmVfdGh1bWJuYWlsX3Bob3Rvcy8wMDAvMzI4Lzc5MC9kYXRhcy9vcmlnaW5hbC5qcGc=/devpost-thumb.jpg?signature=7aca8e550bf590288db032e58e7858d8c89c2fff","True","2"
"Pigeon Point","Summarizes flooded and nasty group chats into topics with clean bullet points of key events.","[4030, ""Everyone has those friends who just add you to their group chats, and then you get incessantly flooded with notifications. After muting conversations, you'll miss invitations and key messages, mainly because you didn't see them. Now there's a way to manage your notifications and be sure that you miss out.It was especially helpful for the TreeHacks Slack group. Especially since we're hacking, we preferred not to be notified much, or spend time just to see where lunch is. It also helped us find out that a guy just dropped off an Echo in the hardware booth, and we promptly intercepted it from another team. :DWe also built this for accessibility. Most people with vision disorders or physical disabilities have a hard time talking to their friends (since most of us use instant messaging, not calls). Our project would allow these people to have the Echo talk to them and basically act as their social assistant. "", ""To summarize group messages from GroupMe, you could tell Alexa to summarize whichever group you want. She'll then tell you what topics were discussed, and the main points said in each topic. She'll even tell you about what certain people were feeling. If you don't fully understand the messages, you could ask her for the context, and she'll tell you what was said before and after. The same functions work if you want your Slack messages summarized.For Slack specifically, we built a Slackbot, which you could enter your commands to select which group to summarize. All the other functions above apply here too!  "", ""For the summarization itself, we implemented Jolo Balbin's thesis on summarizing a single topic text block. It involved finding the most common ideas, and ranking the sentences based on how similar they were to other sentences. This was coded in Python, and lives inside an AWS Lambda function. Most group chats have many conversations going on though, so we also built a classifier function using IBM Alchemy's concept extractor and clustered similar words together using NLTK. We then ran the summarization script on each of the specific conversation topics and got out key points.The Slack Bot was hosted using a Python flask image running on Microsoft Azure, that's where all the API calls and data lived. This was called on by the Lambda function on AWS. We then used our Lambda function and Azure backend to link functionality to the Echo. "", ""We had a hard time when we first ran our summarizer on the Slack conversations, because it wasn't optimized for multiple topics. We fixed this by splitting the conversation.It was hard to get our hands on an Echo, so we developed most of it without being able to see results on the go. Our Slack summarization backend saved us though. Also, we had a hard time deploying packages on AWS because it needed us to make special versions of NLTK and other packages to run. "", ""We're particularly proud about implementing one of NLP's hardest problems, and how we worked around the limitations of the thesis by classifying messages.Also, we're proud of building something that would help us and almost everyone, and how it helps a certain segment greatly. "", 'All of us were well versed in Python and backend, but not so much on web development. We had a fun time learning about deployment and learning about how servers communicate with each other. ', ""Link our backend to Facebook Messenger, text messages, and even news sites. Then we can get acquired by Microsoft's GroupMe or Facebook.

"Neighborhood Airport Noise Monitor","Continuously monitor and complain to Metro Airports Commission about elevated aircraft noise in your neighborhood.","[2622, 'This year (2015) people living in South Minneapolis have filed a record-amount of complaints of aircraft noise. Each complaint requires a phone call. As an engineer working in the IoT industry, I believe the residents of any neighborhood near an Airport could benefit from a small, cheap solution that can identify when an aircraft flies over their house and files a complaint for them.  ', ""Powered by a microprocessor with a Python interpreter, an audio input and an internet connection, the device will continuously sample the Sound Pressure Level (SPL) in decibels as well as analyze the timbre of the sampled audio to determine if the sound heard was a commercial aircraft. The device will continuously report the SPL to Exosite, but will make its best effort to report an aircraft event when its native algorithm makes an appropriate determination. The reason for the analysis of the audio timbre processing on the device is to keep a large portion of the signal processing performed on the gear the user/community has already paid for. It makes no sense to do processing in the cloud when a cheap device is capable of it as well. This will keep the cost of the IoT solution down.MAC currently has 39 listening towers. From this picture one can easily see there are underserved neighborhoods. The aim of this project is to crowd-source the datacollection and provide another means of accountability for airport noise. In engineering, it is good practice to have someone besides the developer test the code / hardware. It's a system of checks and balances just like the American system of government. Currently, MAC seems to monitor, police and regulate itself. With a democratic monitoring system, we might find that some neighborhoods' complaints will now be backed by evidence.Other useful linksWikipedia on how noise affects stressNeat article on SPL and healthStar Tribune article on S.
