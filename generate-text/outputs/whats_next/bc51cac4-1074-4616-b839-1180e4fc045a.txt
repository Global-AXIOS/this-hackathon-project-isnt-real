A new product is in the works for the fall, but it's not yet ready to show on the iOS app store. In the meantime, it's a great way to share your own designs with your friends. One of the first things we did was to build a fan-based app to help students to create their own first-time designs, and a user-based app to help students learn how to create a first-time design. They can then use this to grow their skills in a classroom setting. The app will also allow them to send messages to the students using their mobile app. We hope to have the app in the hands of the students in the near future.

I'm extremely proud of the way that the database has been built, but I want to make sure that the app is very polished and more accurate in the future.                         An attempt was made to make the database easier to use, but I feel that this is not the best way to do that.
