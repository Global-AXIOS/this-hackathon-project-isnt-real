Upon doing further research, we realized that these terms do not actually convey the expiration date of the product. For example, the term ""best buy"" is when the flavor is the best, not when the product expires. Over 33% of participants in a study conducted last year incorrectly assumed date labeling is federally regulated and another 26% were unsure.

"Regen Network - ReDAOMint","A reDAOmint is a DeFi mechanism that encourages investors to invest in the future ecological health of the planet in a way that generates win-win scenarios for everyone involved","[7775, ""Protecting Earth's most precious natural environments - such as the Amazon rainforest - is often dangerously dependent on unstable political and economic forces. While the Amazon's critical importance as a carbon sink, source of oxygen, and biodiversity hotspot is widely acknowledged worldwide, the local economics in inhabited portions of the forest are often not conducive to protecting this planetary treasure. Instead of relying on government policies and inefficient charities, what if we could create a decentralized economic vehicle that made long-term protection of the forest economically beneficial for local residents?  "", 'For a slide-show presentation see https://bit.ly/redaomint. For a screen-cast see: https://share.getcloudapp.com/NQuejBzyA reDAOmint (regenerative + endowment + DAO + tendermint) is a shareholder DAO that holds a pool of assets for perpetuity, distributing the dividends of those assets with land stewards in critical bioregions in exchange for protecting the land. The DAO funds itself by minting new shares in exchange for valuable market assets that produce dividends or rewards (such as staking tokens).The assets in the DAO are managed by the shareholders who can rebalance the portfolio and move staking tokens to their parent zones over IBC to delegate them and collect rewards. Through good management of the funds, the asset value should grow and produce dividends. The dividends cannot, however, be directly withdrawn by the shareholders - they are instead distributed to land stewards whose good land stewardship has been verified, ideally by a low cost technology such as satellite verification (something Regen Network is already actively working on).Land stewards enter into a contract with the DAO to protect the land, and as long as they keep protecting it they will receive dividends on a regular basis. This provides a continuous supplementary income stream for these land stewards. If, however, they degrade the land by deforesting it, their share of DAO rewards gets slashed, returned to the DAO and they can no longer participate. In this way the reDAOmint acts as a long term financial support vehicle for the land, which goes beyond what unstable government or non-profit support could provide.For investors in the reDAOmint, the investment is not, however, simply a charity and could also be consider a decentralize public hedgefund. reDAOmint shares provide dividends that come in the form of ecosystem service credits. These credits represent unaccounted ecological benefits from protecting the land which is an emerging asset class  estimated to grow from 36B USD in 2017 to 1T USD over next 20 years. An example of these are carbon credits, which will be increasingly demanded by governments and the public. reDAOmint shareholders can either use the ecosystem service credits they have received as dividends for their own offseting purposes or sell them on the market.In comparison to traditional mechanisms for protecting land, a reDAOmint provides the following benefits:insulates land stewards from seasonal variation in the ecological health of landinsulates land stewards from volatility in the price of ecosystem service creditsefficiently generates ecosystem services by good capital managementauditability of all funding and verification activity ', 'The reDAOmint is built using the Cosmos SDK using a fork of cosmos/gaia that includes IBC support. A diff of our work can be seen here: https://github.com/regen-network/reDAOmint/pull/3.We produced two new Cosmos modules and an ORM package to create the reDAOmint.redaomint moduleThe redaomint module implements a shareholder DAO that produces dividends of ecosystem service credits for shareholders and dividends of the underlying asset pool for allocated land stewards as described above. It also provides governance proposal and voting support for shareholders. It uses the existing Cosmos bank and supply modules to track holdings of shares, and interacts with the ecocredit module for verification of good land stewardship and distributing credits. The primary documentation for the module can be found here: https://github.com/regen-network/reDAOmint/blob/reDAOmint/x/redaomint/keeper.goecocredit moduleThe ecocredit module provides a fractional NFT with metadata specific to ecosystem service credits. It allows for:the creation of new credit classes with a list of approved issuersthe issuance of credits for a specific piece of land and time frameexchange of fractional portions of individual creditsburning credits in order to remove them from circulation (in the language of carbon credits this is called retiring and means that you are using the credit as an offset)Documentation here: https://github.com/regen-network/reDAOmint/blob/reDAOmint/x/ecocredit/keeper.goorm packageIn order to make the implementation of the above modules easier, we implemented an orm package to handle secondary indexes and the automatic generation of ID\'s. This is inspired by the Weave SDK\'s and is something we\'ve been intending to build for a while. While it was its own ""mini-project"", it greatly simplified implementation of the other code. ', ""we intended to use IBC to connect to the DEX and query price data in order to mint new reDAOmint shares using a bonding curve.

In my biomedical research laboratory, people forget to order fresh lab supplies. These supplies include ingredients to a drug, reagents for a diagnostic device... anything! This means we can accidentally be using expired reagents or have development delays because of this oversight. To reduce the burden of needing to remember to order new lab supplies (when it's tough to, when you're in a lab with no computer around...) I made a Amazon Dash-like device with buttons that users can press, which sends an email and text to the lab manager requesting ordering of low supplies.

This price discrepancy is clearly reflected in usage statistics. Today, DEXes mediate less than one percent of daily crypto trading volume. To work towards changing this, we decided to focus on a single segment of the exchange sector, stablecoin swaps, where DEXes have the largest potential cost advantage. Our product, Squink, will enable users to swap between different stablecoins at less than half of the cost of any existing service.   ', 'Squink is an automated market maker that enables extremely low cost swaps between USD stablecoins, e.g. DAI, USDC, and Terra. Fees for utilizing Squink are in the range of 0.05 percent of exchanged volume or $0.50 USD for a $1000 exchange. This is less than half the cost of Binance, the cheapest existing provider. Much like Uniswap, Squink is a lightweight plug n’play module that is easy to integrate into other financial and non-financial products. By integrating Squink, decentralized exchange aggregators can take advantage of small differentials between prices quoted in DAI, USDC, Terra, etc. to save their users substantial amounts of money. Likewise, the exchanges themselves can utilize Squink to aggregate their stablecoin trading pairs into a single integrated order book that offers better prices and deeper liquidity. Finally, e-commerce sites can uitilize Squink to accept any stablecoin, while still receiving payment in their preferred currency.     ', ""Under the hood, Squink uses a generalization of the Uniswap constant product formula that allows for multiple assets and a user-specified level of price volatility.

Although the novelty can be exhilarating, taking flight and seeking out a new social support system may prove to be a daunting task.  Yet, no matter the people we hold close in our lives, from those we’ve known our entire lives to the lab partner we met just a few weeks ago, having those people in our community means the same: ensuring that we feel connected, safe, and taken care of.We wanted to make that process of building and maintaining community easier.  Especially in a major metropolitan city like Austin, safety can be of paramount concern.  Whether they walk, scooter, or rideshare, our final salutation in seeing people off is wishing them safe travels.  Even after departing the nest, Birdie lets you and your loved ones know that those in your community have made it to their destination safely. What is DoesOur app allows users to send/share a history of their location data to those within their community.  The sender presses a button to start their trip, sending friends/family a notification.  From there, receivers can view the person’s trip by viewing the path they followed on a map.  Afterwards, the sender presses a button to end the trip they scheduled, allowing others to know they arrived safely.What Makes it Different?Other location trackers only provide a live view of where people are.  Although this is useful, allowing others to be notified of when you take a trip allows for a practical experience.  For instance, you can send your location on FaceBook messenger, but this can get lost in the messages.  Apps like Strava may be able to track paths you take, but are primarily geared towards running and exercise without having features dedicated to safety.  We wanted an elegant app dedicated for safety that allows for convenient, practical sharing of location.How we Built itWe created our app in Android App Studio, using Google Firebase as a server to store and transmit location data.

At a high school level, we noticed that dividing up into teams, specifically for group projects, was very much inline with privilege - a psychological effect known as in group favoritism. As a result, the effects of inequality became amplified, and social mobility becomes nearly impossible. Similarly, people with similar personality traits tend to group together, which minimizes diversity of thought and leads to, on average, worse team performance (Hoffman and Maier, 1961). Using the ""big five"" personality factors that determine team success (Kichuk and Wiesner, 1997), we created a tool that would prioritize diversity of thought in group creation - with aims of improving group performance and enhancing social mobility. ', 'Students take a short Google Form personality quiz, including short answer questions that are ""graded"" through sentiment analysis.

When teachers create new groups, using a self made GUI, the clusters of likeminded individuals are as split up as possible, leading to teams that reflect optimal diversity. ', 'We used python to create both the GUI and the backend. Using the google-api, we scraped results of the Google Forms and input them into a clustering algorithm powered by sklearn. A one-zero distance metric was used for determining the loss associated with different answers to multiple choice questions. Sentiment analysis was performed by parsing student inputs and searching for positive and negative words (from the canonical list of 6000 training words), and determining which direction the sentiment was more likely to be. On the GUI side, we used tkinter to create a graphic for teacher use. Teachers need only input the URL to google form results and the number of groups they seek to create, and GroupYou will generate the associated teams and display them in the GUI.

"Everett: Reloaded","Think PoS is economically sound? Think again.","[7689, 'With the recent gain of popularity of Proof of Stake (PoS), we have found out that nearly all research focus only on the security aspects of it. Even though PoS vastly changes the economic fundamentals of a blockchain platform, the actual research done regarding the potential problems that could arise was found to be quite lacking compared to its severity.Through our own analysis of PoS, we have discovered quite a few that can be potentially damaging to the ecosystem. The ones found can largely the classified into three categories: Economic, Security, and Market.Economic: Users are given two choices to invest their tokens, staking and DeFi. This causes DeFi lending rates to rise to a level similar to the staking reward rate, decreasing the amount of social benefit generated from DeFi. It also disincentivizes the usage of DeFi, one example being CDP holders having to miss out on potential staking rewards. Interchain transfers of PoS tokens are also disincentivized, as tokens moved outside of their home chain cannot receive staking rewards. The Cosmos network, aiming to connect various different chains, is critically impacted by this.Security: The only way for delegators to hedge in the case of bear markets is to first go through the unbonding process. This also decreases the network security, creating a situation where the security of the network is impacted by the price fluctuation of tokens. Also, ATOMs being used in dApps cannot be delegated and thus unable to contribute to security. This forces token usage to compete with network security, and since less ATOMs will be bonded, this will also cause the Cosmos Hub to have higher inflation.Market: Users are unable to utilize their bonded ATOMs for hedging or speculation purposes. In addition, since the only entity with an incentive to not bond their ATOMs are centralized exchanges (to process withdrawals), a considerable amount of unbonded ATOMs might end up in the hands them. And since only unbonded ATOMs can be traded and contribute to token valuation, the risk of exchanges colluding with each other and manipulating the price might not be that difficult to pull off.As a small addition to the above problems, developed economies have investment products with various amounts of risk and reward. However, for PoS networks, is not the case (Risk: Slashing Possibility. Reward: Delegation Rewards). Even if there are people who truly believe in the platform prefer to take more risks in exchange for a higher amount of rewards, they have no choice but to follow the same risk & reward profiles as everyone else. ', 'With the use of Everett, delegators of the Cosmos Hub are able to mint bATOMs, a secondary shadow token backed by one’s delegation position. Two important features of bATOMs ensure them as an effective solution to the problems mentioned above.Soft Peg with ATOMs: bATOMs are designed to retain the same price with ATOMs. Just like most people treat WETH & ETH and DAI & USD as the same type of asset although they are completely different, by making bATOMs have the same price as ATOMs will minimize the adoption barrier for users and DeFi dApps.Validator Fungibility: Another important feature for maximum usability is issue the same type of tokens independent of which validator the delegator chose to delegate to. Compressing them to a single token ensures both maximum user simplicity and market liquidity.The eventual goal of bATOMs is to become the preferred token of choice for DeFi applications, so that delegators can utilize the bATOMs created using their delegated ATOMs and utilize them on various DeFi applications. This allows users to collect both the delegation rewards and the DeFi dApp interest, eliminating the competitive structure between those two, which in turn maximizes the social benefit.What can I do with itHedging & Speculation: A delegator can now choose to utilize the locked value of their bonded ATOMs are applications like hedging or speculating.Stake & Invest: It is now possible to delegate ATOMs and lend the generated bATOMs through DeFi. Increasing profits for users without causing a decrease in network security.Interchain Staking: Delegators can stake on multiple chains with the same capital by trading bATOMs in exchange for unstaked tokens of other blockchains.Leveraged Delegations: bATOMs can be traded for more unbonded ATOMs, which can be delegated to generate more bATOMs. By repeating this process delegators can effectively leverage on their delegations. This application is further explored by tokenizing the leveraged position and making them available for trading. ', 'As the Cosmos Hub does not support smart contracts or token issuance, it was decided to develop a separate Cosmos Zone that takes care of the smart contract logic and bATOM issuance. To prevent events like slashing from creating undercollateralized LSPs, it was decided to keep 10% of the bonded ATOMs as the slashing collateral. Whenever the slashed amount goes over 5%, the Everett Zone automatically submits an unbonding request to the Cosmos Hub, therefore liquidating the LSP in the risk of undercollateralization.A previously suggested ICS proposal regarding interchain accounts was utilized. This proposal allows the creation of a special address on the Cosmos Hub, which is controlled by Cosmos Zone. This feature is crucial in order for forced liquidations to be triggered in the case of slashings that go beyond the threshold amount.Simplified bATOM Generation Process Generate an Everett Zone controlled user-specific interchain address on the Cosmos Hub Transfer ATOMs to the newly created interchain address Send data including the validator to delegate the transferred ATOMs to A delegate TX is sent to from the Everett Zone to the Cosmos Hub via IBC If all is successful, excluding the slashing collateral of 10%, new bATOMs are granted to the delegator’s addressSimplified ATOM Recovery Process Requests the closure of one’s LSP by submitting a close TX to the Everett Zone The Everett Zone validates whether the user has enough funds in their account If the user’s account contains enough bATOMs, the bATOMs are locked and the ATOM retrieval process is initiated. An unbonding TX is sent from the Everett Zone to the Cosmos Hub If 4 is successful, the locked ATOMs in 3 are burnedA LSP can only be closed by the delegator who initially opened it. The delegator is required to hold the same amount of bATOMs they first created.TLDR of the add-ons done during the hackathon Swapped out our previous pseudo-IBC in exchange for the real thingUse of Interchain Accounts A better frontend for non-aliens Liquid Staking Position (LSP) NFTs, an additional token that has governance rights & receives rewards Tokenized Leveraged LSPs, allowing delegators to choose different risk & reward profiles (e.g. buy 3x leverage LSP tokens to receive 3x the rewards, while the money you lose when slashed also increases 3x.)

"Bounded Chaos","Reinterpreting cellular automata to include a messaging system that allows us to map an input space onto itself in a very unique way. ","[5318, ""Ahmed's short backstory: I was watching tv late one night while living in Brazil, when the signal cut out. I was mesmerized by the random pattern of pixels oscillating on the screen, knowing that a specific percentage of them were caused by cosmic background radiation. Despite the random cosmic element on the tv screen, the pattern was very similar to the deterministic cellular automata I was playing with on my computer. This fascinated me. One pattern was random and the other was deterministic but not chaotic, and yet, the two were indistinguishable from one another. This inspired me to ask the question: if all it takes to create these crazy patterns are a very simple set of deterministic functions mapping onto one another, then what is random, and what really is chaotic? What else would I be able to produce? There's beauty in chaos. Key wordsHilbert (space filling) curveCellular automataRecursive mappingCombinatronicsDebrujin SequencesMemory "", ""We're exploring the evolutionary dynamics of these cellular automata and visualizing them for an audience unfamiliar with the math. We've provided the theoretical underpinning of this framework, coupled with a simple graphical interface that demonstrates the localized effect of the interaction between two arbitrary rules. Cellular automata provide a way to bound chaotic inputs amongst a closed set of states.Independent of how complex your pattern is, you can always recurse deeper into the solution space because you can always generate more intricate inputs to be processed through the rule set that you have. This maximizes the amount of information you're extracting about the patterns in those inputs. This is why chaos is now bounded. You're simply limited by the processing power you have to recurse through this infinite space as compared to the complexity of the pattern you're seeking. "", ""Basically we reinterpreted cellular automata to separate the input space from the message space. What that means is we can run cellular automata in three different ways, forming a chain of actions and interactions. The visualization we created takes an ordered image (gradient mapped along a hilbert curve) and disturb it by passing the inputs through a randomly chosen pair of cellular automata rules and observing the localized effects of their interactions. Message = Rule(Input)Rule(s) = Input(Message)Input(s) = Rule(Input)Passing an input through a rule to receive a message reduces the amount of information we can extract from it, because running that message backwards to extrapolate the initial input in fact can only give you a possibility space that contains probable inputs that generated that message. Sp when you group two rules and a message, what you're creating is a mapping between one input space onto another input space, where only some of those inputs are relevant. To do this, we setup an ordered hilbert curve and used colour to express that order. Then we disturbed that order by choosing two random rules and seeing how the curve visually translates when run through them. The function we used to update the colour values is the same used in reinforcement learning to update the reward expectations.

"Duke Tutor","A Remote Tutoring Platform for Duke Students","[4084, ""We believe that tutoring is an integral component of achieving academic success. Duke's current tutoring system is restrictive with a strict one tutor policy, lacks transparency because of the little to no agency a student has in choosing their tutor, and is expected to be an in person interaction. With so much homework, programming, and projects done on computers and online, there is an opportunity for transparent and flexible tutoring to be made available in this environment. For example, most of the work for EGR 103 requires programming. To supplement face-to-face sessions, tutors may want to access a student's machine remotely and provide assistance.

Analysis of this data can be used to discover relations between different teaching and learning styles which can help improve approaches and strategies to tutoring.  "", ""Duke tutor is a remote tutoring platform that connects students with tutors and provides a flexible, effective, and interactive tutoring experience. Tutors registered with Duke tutor each have a profile including the class they tutor for, what time slots they can tutor at, and their type of teaching style. When students access Duke tutor, they first pick the class they want a tutor for and are presented a calendar of all tutors and their available times for that class. Students have the ability to view each tutor's profile to evaluate which tutor best matches them. A choice is made when the student chooses the name of the tutor, the time slot, and the learning style the best identify with. Once the request is verified, an email is sent to both the tutor and student including a link to the virtual tutoring session as well as a feedback form. The virtual session includes functions such as voice chat, screen share, and the control of a device from another device.

Probus will have an initial offering of tokens and then move to a generative model where more participation on the platform will lead to the creation/issuing of more tokens. Smart flagging is done by agents wherein a set number of agents participate in voting on whether a piece of content should be flagged or not.

When the “CALL” button is pressed, the application would use the GPS to get the user’s location and use text-to-speech to convert the address into sound form so that the police would hear it — however, no sound would come out from the phone so that the user can remain undiscovered.Furthermore, when the “MESSAGE” button is pressed, the application would lead to a screen where the user can choose which counselor she/he wants to receive counseling and support from and start texting anonymously with the counselor. The counselor would not be able to see the phone number or any other personal information of the user, because the user is never required to enter anything.Accomplishment-We created a clearly-manifested home screen with only two buttons to press as well as a location detection function so that users who need to call the police can do it right away.-The Message function was created on a second screen, where the user can select a counsellor, sending text messages to the selected counselor, receive responses, and the latest messages are displayed.-The Call function would directly call 911 as soon as the user presses the button.ChallengesAll of our team members were first-time hackers entirely new to the field of application development.

', ""Login or sign up in the main page, the user's first name, last name, email and password would be collected and saved on Cloud Firestore database (which is powered by Firebase) for later login check. After successful login or signup, the user would be guided to the search page. On this page, he/she can use Google map to locate his/her position, he/she can also specify search radius within which medical centers and hospitals would be fetched from the MEDICARE HOSPITAL COMPARE DATASET. Then the user would be displayed with the distances and names of the hospitals and medical centers. Upon clicking on a specific hospital name, he could get the route on how to get to that hospital or medical center. Detailed information including address in text form, as well as overall rating of the facility would also be offered to the user. "", ""We started from defining different functionalities we would like to achieve. Then we dice deep into the corresponding components our app should include for those functionalities. Our implementation is in Xcode. We implement the backend using Google Firebase. More specifically, we user Firebase authentication library for user login and signup, and Firestore to store user information. We choose Firebase out of the consideration of reliability and stability. To fetch hospital and medical center information, we call API offered by the MEDICARE HOSPITAL COMPARE DATASET by giving a URL including the geolocation information of the user and the search radius defined by him/her. We've also added the functionalities of displaying route to the hospital and rating of it after the user pick one from the search results. "", ""The backend part was kind of challenging since neither of us had used Firebase as backend previously. But we made to learn how to use it and integrated with our Swift codes. Also using MapView in Xcode to locate user was hard at the beginning since we had not used this component previously. Debugging in the TableView part for displaying hospitals was really tricky. Last but not least: Hold on and don't give up! "", ""We're proud of the persistence both team members demonstrate under pressure. Both of us were newbies for some of the technologies in this project but we stood together and managed to accomplish the goals we set at the beginning. We're proud of the great collaboration between us and valued that as a great experience to learn how to work together with a short deadline. Last but not least, we are happy that we've managed to deliver something that is practical and can help solving a real health and wellness problem. "", ""A lot. We've learned new technologies and tools. We've learned how to be well disciplined under pressure. We've also learned how to collaborate and accomplish tasks with a short deadline. "", ""We would like further improve our UI design, offering more information on hospitals and medical centers. Another useful feature we consider to implement is to cache the search history of user locally in user's device. Then next time when he enters the app he can just check out the past search results if he wants instead of locating and searching again. Also adding features like making appointments to visit the hospital or medical center in the app, rating for the hospital the user has visited in our app will be part of the future work.

But there was a problem – while some shelters and donation drives overflowed with supplies, others were still empty-handed. Donations were often abundant in certain areas of the city, while the under-served communities that need them most went without. This inspired Full House- a system for managing and balancing the inventory of multiple shelters and leveling the playing field. ', 'Full House has two main functions.  First, to help shelters manage their inventory by determining scarcity or surplus. And second, to connect shelters with others that may have the supplies that they need. Full House accomplishes this with a search tool that lets users easily query the inventory, and with a dashboard that recommends other shelters.  ', ""The core of our product is connecting shelters together based on need. In order to get our data, we scraped Goodwill stores for product information, formatted them to be stored in our Mongo DB database, and kept track of their specific categories. With a set of categories, we could easily show what percentage of a shelter's inventory is made of a certain category, and allow shelters to specify what percentage they require.

"Chladni Plates: Simulation vs. Reality","We built physical Chladni Plate setup, which is a way to visualize the creation of standing sound waves. We also programmed a simulated Chladni plate in order to see the differences between the two.","[4334, ""We were inspired by demonstrations of this effect shown on Youtube. We wanted to see if we could build a simulator to arrive at the same results and to build our own Chladni plate from scratch. This initial inspiration was incubated by Dawson's SPACE extracurricular program who sponsored our presence at the hackathon and gave us all the opportunities we needed to succeed. "", 'In the physical model, we use an online tone generator to send sine wave sound frequencies to a speaker through a guitar amp. The speaker is attached to a driving rod, which acts as the vibration source for a metal plate attached to it. The vibration produces standing waves on the plate. By sprinkling salt on the plate we can visualize the nodal lines on the plate, as the salt will displace towards those line, away from the parts of the plate that are moving.The simulation displays a graph that represents a possible pattern of a square Chladni plate. Using interactive sliders you can change parameters to change the shape of the pattern to see other possibilities. ', 'We modded a guitar amp, replacing the built-in speaker with a speaker with a plastic cap, which allowed us to attach the driving rod to the center of the speaker. The driving rod is attached to the plate at the center. In order to keep the rod upright, we built a wooden support base which is mounted to the speaker. The simulation uses a given formula for representing the nodal lines of a Chladni plate derived from the 2D wave equation. Using a plotting library in Python we graphed the equation, displaying the Chladni pattern for the given parameters. ', 'Building the physical Chladni plate came with a host of challenges. Given our lack of construction resources, cutting the materials down to size and drilling the necessary holes took a good deal of time. Also, the patterns produced on the physical Chladni plate are very different from the complex patterns produced in the simulation, due to the nature of the build and the limitations of the materials. Plotting the equation ended up being more difficult than expected, as the library we used does not have an easy way of representing implicit curves (like the equation we are using). Another big challenge was getting the interactivity to work properly. However, we were able to eventually get over these challenges and arrived at the final product. ', 'The proudest accomplishment is that we actually managed to get both the physical and simulated demos to work in some degree. The challenges we had to deal with took a considerable amount of time and research to work through, as we are all happy that we arrived at a finished product we can be proud of. ', 'We had two major takeaways from this project. First, the math and physics of Chladni plates is much more complicated than any of us expected, involving 4th-degree PDEs and eigenfunctions, both of which are way above our level of knowledge as cegep students. Second, it is very difficult to build real simulations of physical phenomena in a way that closely fits the theoretical predictions. There are so many variables to take into account in the real world that being able to create a theoretically consistent simulation is a very difficult and impressive feat.   ', 'With some more research, we hope to be able to find the relationship between the driving frequency and the patterns produced by the plate so that the simulation can be adapted to accept frequency inputs. Once we have a better understanding of the physics, we hope we can also simulate non-square plates, eventually arriving at simulations for arbitrary plate shapes. However, given that the math is complicated enough for square plates, we recognize that the second goal would require extensive research and significant dedication to complete.

"Waitlist of Lucidity","Crowdsourced waitlist sizes for UT Austin Registration","[3540, ""It's registration season at UT Austin again! In a time that's supposed to be filled with hope and excitement, however, many students dread the prospect of seeing all their classes fill up before they register, not knowing which section of a class has the shortest waitlist to sign up for because UT doesn't show the size of a waitlist until a student is already on it. For example, a student picking the waitlist for a class section at random could end up at spot #20. However, he wouldn't know that he could have signed up for a section with only 2 people on the waitlist. After seeing our classmates struggle over the years with getting the classes they need, we decided on a solution of transparency that would let everyone share with each other the sizes of all the waitlists they are on, ultimately enabling them to make an informed decision.

Our image data was sorted into 6 categories — potholes, graffiti, broken sidewalks, signs covered by trees, broken traffic signs, or littering — after we uploaded our dataset to the Google Cloud Console.  Through the use of Google’s Cloud AutoML Machine Learning system, we developed a deep learning Neural Network Image Classifier that identified images and placed them into one of our five categories with an average precision of 0.981.  Additionally, the frequency of false positives generated by our model was 5.00%, and the frequency of false negatives was 9.52%. Prior to using Google’s Cloud AutoML, we experimented with Apple’s CreateML to develop models for our image classification system.  While CreateML served as a useful placeholder, we experienced difficulties in achieving a high enough level of image identification precision with this software.  After we managed to get AutoML working, we replaced CreateML with AutoML and our app’s functionality increased significantly.After creating a working machine learning model, we focused on the app development aspect of our project.  We originally attempt to develop both Android and Ios versions of our app, but we eventually decided to just focus on Ios.  We intend to develop an Android app after the completion of HackDuke, since we intend to eventually place our product on the app store.  We developed a basic UI to allow the user to change the category of the maintenance request (for the rare cases when AutoML fails to classify the incident correctly).  Following that, the user is asked 2-3 additional questions about the event.  These questions come from the City of Durham website. Lastly, the information about the incident is emailed to the correct person within the City of Durham maintenance department, along with the address of the incident and the photo of it.ChallengesInitially, we used Apple’s Create ML app to develop a machine learning model that would predict the type of environmental issue we categorized based on Durham One Call’s form.  CreateML was unable to create a model for us that was precise enough for our needs, and often misidentified maintenance incidents even after extensive training.  We solved this challenge through the use of Google’s AutoML system instead. We were really excited that our neural network was fully functioning after training for two hours. However, we believe that if our data set had provided a more extensive and accurate depiction of all of our categories, we could develop a significantly more accurate Neural Network Image Classifier.  Unfortunately, due to the time constraints and lack of a data set which we were faced with, we were unable to achieve a more accurate machine learning program within 24 hours.Another challenge we faced was developing the app from Android, since, none of us had any Android App Development experience.  We were unable to overcome this challenge in the allotted time, and so we instead decided to focus solely on developing an IOS app.What's nextMoving forward, we would like to get QuickReport to work with the Durham One Call website. Furthermore, we plan on developing our app to address environmental and maintenance issues in other locations in North Carolina (e.g. Raleigh) as well as around the world. For instance, Raleigh also has a convoluted online request form for resolving street issues that must be filled out by a user.

"", 'We used python2 and python3 with getOldTweets to pull the Twitter post information, Google Sentiment Analysis API to generate sentiment information.For the data analysis, Jupyter Notebook was used in conjunction with Java Swing to help visualize these plot in an clean GUI fashion. ', 'Twitter Analysis:Initially, we wanted to use Tweepy to pull relevant tweets of specific locations and date ranges because of previous experience in using it. Assigning locations was a bit odd: rather than taking in a location by keyword as a string (ex: ""Melbourne""), Tweepy actually requires the input of the top left and bottom coordinates of corners of a geographical box selection of that location. Pulling from the Google Maps Places API, we were able to pull this information. We then realized that Tweepy strictly pulls from the most recent tweets... there was no way to access past posts. We then decided to pivot and try to use Twitter\'s official API, until we learned Twitter\'s API has specific regulations on accessing tweets only within the past two weeks.With some in-depth Google Searches, we found a script on GitHub called getOldTweets that pulled historical Tweets using a unique method. Unfortunately, the update of the code from python2 to python3 was incomplete, thus while  location searching was available, date range queries weren\'t. However, both features still existed in the python2 version of the code. We decided to just write and run this scraping of the Twitter posts in python2, and write everything else in python3.Another challenge was that we are both computer science majors who did not have much experience in data analysis. Dealing with huge datasets in the hundreds-of-thousands was new territory to us, and it truly taught us a lot about how to deal with data. For example, we found that many entries of the data had to be discarded due to being unreasonable outliers or sparse entries. We also had to implement an efficient algorithm that could process all of this data in a reasonable time, which was done with a bit of dynamic programming in addition to concurrent processing to speed up our dataset retrieval. In addition, we had to figure out how to implement a Java GUI to show all of our data plots, so getting Java and Python to interface together was an interesting challenge.

"DrinkSafely","Alcohol poisoning is a rampant problem across America. Our wearable aims to keep users safe by helping them pace drinks and water, by counting drinks, and by being able to contact emergency services.","[2842, 'We were initially inspired because we saw a problem in our own Duke Community. So many of our peers and even our friends overdose on alcohol and require emergency services. Every weekend, and even many weekdays, we see several ambulances going to pick up another student with alcohol poisoning. This is not only a problem at Duke, but a widespread epidemic at Colleges throughout the U.S. Every year, more than 1500 students die from an alcohol overdose. For our project, we wanted to create something to combat that stunning statistic. Thus our idea to bridge into alcohol safety was born.What it DoesOur project is a wearable that counts the amount of drinks you’ve taken, reminds you to hydrate, times when you can have another drink, and gives you an easy way to contact an emergency number if something went wrong. Specifically, our wearable has a RGB LED light and a piezoelectric sensor. On a timer, the LED lights up blue and sends the user a text reminder about drinking water. Similarly, the wearable times how long between drinks and tells the user when it is ok to drink again, to allow the user to pace themselves throughout the night. Our wearable counts the amount of drinks by the person double tapping on the sensor. Finally, our wearable will contact an emergency number, when the person triple taps the sensor. How We Built ItFirst, we tried to build the project on a Particle Photon board. We were unable to flash code on this device, so we ended up switching to an Arduino. We uploaded firmata code on the Arduino. Firmata allows a python program on a laptop to control and read pins on the Arduino. We then wrote a python program that reads sensor values and sends SMS messages to a specific phone number. Finally, we soldered a circuit that includes the piezoelectric sensor and an RGB LED to a protoboard and protoshield. What We LearnedWe mainly learned the basics of hardware prototyping. We had to program an Arduino and wire up a LED and sensor circuit. We also learned how to design and solder a custom protoboard. We had to make sure it was durable so we hot glued all the connections. After this project, we feel more equipped to try more electronics prototyping in the future. Challenges We FacedWe initially wanted to use a Particle Photon board to read sensor input and send out SMS messages. Unfortunately, we had a lot of trouble setting up the board. Despite hours of troubleshooting, we could not flash code onto the board. In the end, we decided to work with an Arduino instead. We were able to restructure code and upload code onto this microcontroller which solved our previous issue.

"Teeter Toddler","Worried about leaving your child with a sitter? You may have cameras, but can't they see everything. Teeter Toddler is a small device that takes real-time data capable of sensing if your child is safe","[7437, ""What inspired us the most during our stay here at WHACK, was the drive to push ourselves into doing a project outside our skill set . What we decided to do as a team was, find an issue in today's world we could make a difference in by creating something in the allotted 32 hours. It was then that our idea sparked. A device that could track the safety of your child and alert you of possible harmful or dangerous situations your child may face while you're away from them, thus creation a sense of relief for said parent/parents. Most importantly increasing the safety of young children and newly born infants. "", ""Our project begins with a Texas Instruments CC2541 Sensor Tag. The sensor tag is then sewn into a baby's onesie or if the child is older, could also be attached to the exterior of their clothing. The CC2541 has the capability to collect IR Temperature, Ambient Temperature, Proximity, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Simple Keys, Humidity, Barometer, and Magnetometer data real time. For our project we focused on the Accelerometer, Gyroscope, and Ambient Temperature data that was being collected. The application Teeter Toddler does the rest, monitoring the data collected for any abnormalities or sudden changes in the babies movement which may indicate poor handling of the child, which may place the child in danger (Shaken Baby Syndrome). If the sensor detects such data, it immediately sends an audible notification alarm to the user informing them of the situation. The same is done with the Ambient Temperature data collected, if the baby is in a possible harmfully cold or hot environment, the user receives a notification to check on them. For temperature data, it is constantly being displayed to the user via the app. As the temperature falls or raises the app begins to alert the user via notifications, unless the temperature hits a dangers level and then the application sends an audible alarm. The goal here was to provided parents with protection and a sense of ease that their children are well taken care of in their absence in real time. That's not all, at first we look at this solution as a way to monitor others who look after our children but then came to a realization. The application could also be used in other ways, for instants. With the data being collected in real time, a new mother/father could use this same application to ensure safe handling of their child in their own hands. Also a growing problem we noticed in the news is the amount of cases where parents, perhaps due to stress or other factors, forget their children in the car during hazardous conditions. Teeter Toddler could be the determining factor in those precious few minutes of life or death, all with a simple yet accurate notification alert. With the Gyroscope and temperature data collected we could help prevent some of the top leading sleep environmental factors leading to Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Factors like the infant sleeping on their stomach or side. Babies placed in these positions to sleep might have more difficulty breathing than those placed on their backs, with the Gyroscope data we can help further prevent this. Another example is overheating, being too warm while sleeping can increase a baby's risk of SIDS. With both Ambient Temperature and IR temperature at our disposal, we could lower the number of cases reported with a simple app. "", 'The CC2541 is a power-optimized true system-on-chip (SoC) solution for both Bluetooth low energy and proprietary 2.4-GHz applications. It enables robust network nodes to be built with low total bill-of-material costs. The CC2541 combines the excellent performance of a leading RF transceiver with an industry-standard enhanced 8051 MCU, in-system programmable flash memory, 8-KB RAM, and many other powerful supporting features and peripherals. We also experimented with other microcontrollers, but in order to keep it small enough to not be bothersome to the child and still big enough not to be a choking hazard we stuck with the CC2541. Once attached, the CC2541 begins to collect real time data and passes it along into our application. The application side was developed within Evothings Studios and Workbench. This allowed us to create an application capable to run in both Android and Apple Operating Systems using JavaScript and HTML. Libraries such as Easyble.js and Tisensortag.js played an instrumental role in our final product. ', 'With a collective of very little experience in hardware and application development, getting started was a lot hard than we first envisioned. Nevertheless we had a goal in mind and worked as a team to further strengthen ourselves more into the subject we knew could use some polishing. Documentation on the TI CC2541 sensor tag was difficult to find since the company has since released newer versions of the sensor tag. This made it particularly difficult for us to properly extract the information we needed, but with some heavy duty digging we were able to find what we needed to make it all come together. ', ""Since we are Cyber Security students, we normally only focus on cyber security related projects  Yet instead we took what was said at opening ceremony to heart and decided to try something new to all of us.Finding a real world problem and solving it with something we made. To come out of all of that after 32 hours of not sleeping with a working prototype couldn't make our team any prouder. "", ""Asking what we didn't learn would be a smaller response. Even though 32 hours doesn't seem like a long time, one can definitely feel it. Practically every piece required to make our project work, meant a team member/members stopping what they were doing to do an hour or two of research to continue to stride forward towards the finish line. The most valuable thing we learned this weekend is that just because we know how to find exploit and vulnerabilities in things like apps and hardware components. It is a totally different prospective in building them that requires additional knowledge. "", 'Our team has decided to continue with this project after WHACK.

"BitWise","Anyone can help label complex datasets with our 20 questions like app and make money in the process.","[5522, 'Datasets for machine learning like ImageNet have created so much value and are an incredibly important part of the future. However, barely anyone can help label them. With over a thousand classes, even excluding the prevalence of very specific nouns and species of animals like birds, the task of knowing every class in such a large dataset is incredibly hard. We wanted to improve this and allow anyone to help researchers and companies label datasets while making a little money in the process.  ', 'Instead of requiring people to learn the intricacies of image datasets, we propose treating image labeling like a game of 20 (or N) questions. Users are tasked with answering the same binary question for groups of images of the same decision node. As users answer these questions, images are propagated further down the tree iteratively until they are classified. Users gain points for each image they classify and can redeem these in the future for gift cards. There are multiple advantages for this solution. By giving users much of the same mental task in a row, people don’t have to constantly shift their attention to different classification tasks and can therefore work more efficiently and have greater accuracy. One challenge arises in this solution: how do you produce binary questions at scale for a very large, specific dataset? For this, we use WordNet, a NLP dataset that encodes the hyponyms and hypernyms (supersets and subsets of words) in a tree. Since any tree can be binarized, we can create a new question set for almost any dataset instantly. We can use a Least Common Ancestor algorithm to find the lowest common branch of the tree for all needed categories and shake the tree to decrease the number of classifications needed per image.With BitWise, we can significantly increase the number of people who can help label datasets and do it at a greater speed than ever before. People can also make money in an ethical and equitable way in the process. ', 'Our backend is built with a REST API in Flask connected to a MongoDB database in Python. One of the advantages of using a non-relational database like MongoDB is that we can represent our database like an actual tree. We calculate the tree structure using WordNet, a dataset that maps the semantic field relationships (supersets and subsets of words) between words in a tree-like structure, binarizing the tree. We implemented a custom scheduler to navigate the tree and find the next best images a user should classify. We also host our static images on-server. Currently, our app is configured to use a subset of ImageNet called TinyImageNet. However, this is easily configurable. This is all deployed on Google Cloud.Our frontend is a React Native app compiled with the Expo toolchain, written in Javascript. The app sends a GET request to our API to get new image URLs, IDs and categories to classify from our scheduler, and sends a POST request back for each image classified with an image id and a boolean. The database is updated in real-time and can support simultaneous users as well as users exiting the app and never classifying images.

This inspired us to create Clip It, a tool that can programmatically create highlight reels of Twitch streams in a matter of seconds. ', ""Clip It allows you to find the highlights of your favorite streams. Given the URL for a video, it finds the highlights by tracking two key metrics:1) Local spikes in chat message frequency (i.e. the equivalent of volume level in Twitch chat). We keep a rolling median of the number of messages sent in consecutive 30-second windows; and window that is significantly higher than the local median could be of interest!2) Sentiment magnitude of the chat messages. To detect this, we used Google Cloud Platform's natural language processing-based sentiment analysis API, which returns sentiment score (i.e. positive or negative) and sentiment magnitude (how positive or negative). We focused on just sentiment magnitude, as that will pick out an interesting and wide variety of events, from controversial to exciting moments! Once again, we track local spikes in sentiment magnitude compared to the rolling median to find clips of interest.We then look at the product of the differences between each metric and its rolling median--the clips with the highest value for this number therefore have large spike in both metrics. We return the timestamps with the highest values to make our highlight reel!

In rural areas, finding the nearest charging station can be very difficult, and may put off potential electric vehicle (EV) owners. In order to solve this problem, we decided to create a utility to help users find and map the closest EV charging station dynamically, based on the charge of the EV and projected route. If we can solve this commonplace issue among prospective buyers, we can encourage more people to buy EVs, thereby reducing global emissions and improving the carbon footprint on the environment.

First we check if it's weekend and then divide the time into AM and PM and check what they're doing at that time and whether to call or not. we put the result into variable suggest.

For analyzing data part, we have tons of if statements to deal with. (eg. check if it's bed time, lunch time, work time and etc.) However, it's impossible for us to put every time in the condition. We try to convert the time to integer and then use > or < to find a time range, but it fails since time (eg. 11:30) cannot be converted into 32 integer. And then we try to convert time to string variable and compare strings. But it fails since for 1:00,  the second character is ':', but for 11:00, the second character is  '1'; ascii of '1' will be definitely smaller than ':', so it will show us that '1:00'>'11:00'. Finally we figure out this by using time.Contains(), and we made it! "", 'We work out a time schedule for the person we want to call very specifically. We take consideration whether it is weekdays or weekend and even when ""they\'re on their way to work"" or ""they\'re on their way home"".

"Biasd","Allowing users to learn more about twitter -- and themselves.","[4437, 'Politics, especially partisan politics, have reemerged in the news in recent times. From the democratic primaries to the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, the public is being flooded with new information. One of the largest sources of this information is Twitter, which is also the preferred form of communication for President Donald Trump. So, we wanted to do something to better understand the information stream of twitter, and we immediately thought of replicating the tweets are a way to discern, as an information consumer, what is false and what is true.  ', 'Our creation allows users to understand their inherent bias, as well as the leanings of twitter. It is a novel way for users to understand the queries that they otherwise would just enter into the search bar of Twitter. Ultimately, Bias allows readers to understand Twitter-and themselves. The user is prompted to enter search queries, from which results are pulled and fake data created. The user then enters this game-like scenario in which they have to choose whether or the tweet is real. In the end, the user is shown a comparison of the sentiment of their favored tweets, as well as the liberal and conservative leanings, as compared with their choices. In the end, they also receive an accuracy score of how accurate they were at discerning what is right and what is wrong.  ', 'The application itself is built on Flask and then hosted locally. The user search query is passed to the Twitter API, from which tweets containing the word are selected. From this corpus of relevant tweets, Markov chaining is used to generate semantically similar tweets. The output is displayed using Charts.js and presented to the user.  ', 'For us, the largest challenge was the segmentation of what we were trying to do. We knew that together, the various parts of the creation (from the fake tweets to the sentiment analysis) would be technically impressive but from a social perspective, meaningless. We knew that each part we could reasonably get running, but we wanted to create a cohesive end product that included all of these parts to best represent how inherent bias affects the understanding of how Twitter information is perceived. ', 'We are most proud of the integrative system and the game-like mechanism for comparison. We think that asking the user to label tweets would have been boring, and taken away from the individual accuracy of some of the fake tweets. So, we wanted to highlight not just the individual tweets but also the aggregation of the data that gives insight into the user, and having this two-page system allows for that. We are also very happy with the believability of these fake tweets, which surprised us after running the Markov chain generator multiple times. This is especially impressive considering the fact that we had to handle hashtags and mentions, which are very common on Twitter. ', ' ', 'The next step for Bias will be to expand the features that we can glean from the information we get. In keeping to a Twitter base, we can also get information about the other types of political parties, such as libertarians or socialists. We don’t want to characterize information as either liberal or conservative, as this is a dichotomy that we hope to break and also inherently part of our bias as developers. We’d also potentially want to expand beyond the Twitter corpus and move to other text-based systems such as Reddit, for example. And of course, we’d like to put this out on the web, where everyone can enjoy it, not just us!

"Prism","Inspired by Pink Floyd's ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" album cover, an effect that explores harmony and chaos in light and sound. The bright and dark side of the moon.","[3898, 'We\'ve been inspired by the Pink Floyd\'s ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" album cover, which shows light going through a prism and then dispersing into individual frequencies. It can be interpreted as a difficulty in understanding the complexity of the world when all factors blend in together (the dark side), while each of them making sense individually (the bright side).Our idea was to make the phone be the prism, and represent the prism\'s ""dark"" and ""bright"" sides with the face and world lenses respectively, letting the user switch between them. Both light and sound are waves, so we immediately thought about representing the light frequencies as sounds. We based the light-audio associations on chromotherapy, so that each colour represents a mood not only visually but also with regards to the sound. ', 'The user starts in the world lens. They can see colourful light rays converging where they hold their phone (at the phone\'s screen). Looking around, they explore therapeutic sounds associated with each light colour individually. The user can then switch to the face lens (the other side of the prism, i.e. the dark side of the moon), where the individual light frequencies from the other side converge into white light, while the previously soothing and energising sounds blend into an unsettling and ""incomprehensible"" unity. The user\'s face is also treated in black and white has a dark styling applied to it. ', ""We've used SparkAR Studio to build the effect. Development was done using JavaScript with Webpack and Babel to facilitate multi-file coding (helpful for collaboration during the hackathon). The world lens effect uses world coordinates to position the light rays around the user, while the face lens uses background segmentation, face tracker and shaders to achieve the desired styling. "", ""Initially the concept for the world lens was to rely on plane tracking and have all the light rays follow the phone (the prism), automatically rotating towards it and adjusting the light rays so they always reach the phone. We've spent a large amount of time and got this working perfectly fine in Spark AR Studio, but the behaviour when testing on an actual device was broken. We have chatted with the Spark AR team and couldn't find a solution to the problem, concluding that it might be a bug or some set of features that are disabled on the device.We've also faced issues with sound playback on the device, which, after a long debugging session, appeared to be an issue of file format (m4u) and replacing them with .wav's solved the issue.

","[3553, 'A lot of adults struggle with persistent feelings of self-doubt, which often stem from experiences in childhood. We also realized the potential of mixed reality to engage with a diverse audience all over the world; however, we also wanted to create something that was accessible. Since many people now have smartphones, we decided to create a therapeutic tool with augmented reality (AR) that is accessible across the world (in contrast to virtual reality that still has a high barrier of entry due to cost).  ', 'Pocket Grow is an AR mobile application that supports the expression of positive affirmation in children ages 5 to 9. This is a critical period in children’s identity development, according to a developmental psychologist, Eric Erickson. The application starts with a breathing exercise that puts the child in the mindset to begin thinking about positive affirmations. This is achieved by a virtual agent that is projected onto the physical space (i.e. augmented onto the physical space) and facilitates the breathing exercise. Children are then encouraged to say positive things about themselves, and the more things they say, the more flowers and other plants grow around them.  ', ""Using Unity as the main engine, we utilized Google's ARCore SDK for Android devices in augmenting the virtual objects onto the physical space. For detecting and analyzing the user's speech, we used IBM Watson's Speech-to-Text, Tone Analyzer, and Text-To-Speech Unity SDKs. For quick prototyping, we used Procreate, Photoshop, Premier.  "", ""None of us have used Unity or any sort of mixed reality/3D game development before. Additionally, we had originally planned to use Google's DialogFlow instead of IBM Watson, since we were already using their ARCore SDK. However, Google had deprecated and shut down their previous version 2 months ago, and there are no longer any Unity plugins for DialogFlow. We then had to shift gears and look for a new NLP tool, and since we had also not used IBM Watson with Unity before, this was also a learning curve.

"Dermax","DerMax is a personal AI skincare disease assistant, which can help patients self-diagnose skin disease and connect the best dermatologists in their vicinity. ","[5452, ""Skin cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the US, and other parts of the world alike, though most cases are preventable. The number of people diagnosed with skin cancer in the last three decades is higher than all previous decades combined, and that number is still increasing. $8.1 million dollars a year goes to skin cancer treatment, with $3.3 million alone attribute to melanoma. The ratio of dermatologists vs patients with skin diseases some of the third world countries is 1:6700. Thus, it becomes challenging for patients to find dermatologists and bear a huge financial burden for themselves, their families and substantial healthcare costs for the nation's economy. Earlier diagnosis can prevent patients from missing the best time of treatments, hence can reduce the costs of treatment and avoid complications. It can also be a powerful tool in helping doctors to make a faster, more reliable and more efficient diagnosis of the diseases. We see great potential in technologies like artificial intelligence with various applications in the healthcare industry, which in turn inspires us to use it for solving skin disease prediction problems, to make this world a better place for everyone. In this hackathon, we have developed ‘DerMax’, a personal skincare assistant.  "", 'Our proposed product, ‘DerMax’, is a personal skincare assistant that can be used to check if one has any skin disease and by dermatologists, providing an extra hand/brain to create a faster diagnosis of skin diseases. We have created a basic website, on which a patient suspected to have some skin disease, can upload a picture of the affected skin region, and at the backend, our image classifier classifies into one of the 10 possible skin diseases. The website then generates a result that shows the probability of the patient having one of the 10 diseases. If the model predicts a high probability of particular skin disease, we plan to direct the patients to one of the best dermatologists in his/her vicinity, decided by a PageRank-like algorithm and can be visualized on the google maps, which is integrated into our website.  ', 'We got an open-source dataset for Skin cancer MNIST dataset from Kaggle, which classifies skin lesion images into either cancerous of skin-disease category. We trained a Resnet 50 classifier on 10,000 images (without data augmentation) and 40,000 images (with data augmentation - flip, mirror, grayscale images, etc.) and classified it into 10 different skin disease classes. We used the pre-trained weights of ResNet50 from the ImageNet dataset and did transfer learning by learning the weights of the final layer. The best accuracy that we received on the validation set was 78.2% while training the model for 50 epochs. We plan to improve on this model’s accuracy by taking the following steps: ', 'We faced many difficulties while working on this. Firstly, it was a little difficult to get an open-source dataset from the internet, and after searching for a long time, we got a dataset on SKIN CANCER MNIST from Kaggle. Secondly, it was to identify the right model architecture, which could potentially learn the subtle features that differentiate one skin-disease from others. While training the network, tuning the hyperparameters, like the number of neurons in the final layer, learning rate, dropout probabilities, etc. took a substantial amount of our time. Combining machine learning pipeline to the website without compromising any features is one of the tough ones, as we didn’t stop to just make a mock-up but wanted to complete it as a whole.

Specifically, it assigns a monetary value to each chore and based on some cycle length and deadline agreed upon by the house, the app will randomly assign the chores to the members of the house. At the beginning of each cycle, house members are charged for the cost their assigned chores are worth. Then, each member has until the chores' specified deadline to complete the chore or they risk losing the money they were charged. In the event they complete it on time, they will receive the corresponding amount back, however, in the event that the chore remains incomplete, it becomes available for others to take on and win the amount the chore is worth. Moreover, House Rules provides a feature for compensating those who incurred significant hardships in their living situation, separate from recurring chores, such as cleaning up after a party or utility maintenance.

","[4459, 'According to research statistics, 80% of students report that they feel stress on a daily basis and 40% of them don’t actively seek help. The response we get when we are seeking emotional support is often “Sorry, I don’t understand.” or “I’m sorry to hear that.” and this hasn’t changed for many years (at least from 2017). Because smartphones and its built-in voice assistant become prevalent these days, we want to create a pocket therapist that offers immediate emotional support whenever and wherever people are. ', 'The Pocket Counselor project is an add-on to the default voice assistant software that provides more human responses to help students deal with stress at school. Imagine talking to Siri/Google Assistant about how stressful you are during midterms and instead of hearing “Sorry, I don’t understand.”, they reply to you with “Take some time and go over all the topics you don’t understand. You can do it!” We have trained the voice assistant to recognize and offer different responses to problems related to schoolwork, friends, family, suicidal tendencies, and negative emotions such as sadness, frustration, stress, and depression, etc. ', 'We built this prototype through the developer platform Actions on Google for Google Assistant. With hours of research into common problems students face, we put at least 5 example phrases as Machine Learning training data for the agent for each intent we have covered. The intents include SchoolPorblem, FamilyProblem, JobProbelm, RelationshipProblem, ImposterSyndrome, LifeSaver, Encouragement, Appreciation, etc. We also provided at least 5 example responses the agent can reply to each intent. During our testing stage, we are able to do live demo through any phones with Google Assistant installed and developer accounted linked. ', 'Feasibility: Our original idea is to make the voice assistant recognize whether user has potential symptoms of mental illness and then provide real-time assistance 24/7. If a user demonstrates severe mental stress or depression, the voice assistant will then seamlessly connect a counselor with the user during the conversion. However, this idea is hard to achieve in reality. Since this service is available for users at any time, it might be difficult to connect users with a counselor at midnight, which involves certain operational costs that cannot be avoided.Training data: Currently, we manually typed in possible conversations between a student with potential mental illness symptoms and the voice assistant. Since it is not a comprehensive dataset, there are use cases that we did not include. For this to be said, our current outcome provides a solid framework that combines counseling feature with voice assistant.User Utterance:How to understand user utterance in a broader context of the dialogue is the main challenge while developing the add-on counseling feature of Google Assistant. In Google Assistant’s developer platform, we can add parameters such as dates, times, and places that define which parts of the user utterances to extract. However, Google Assistant does not allow us to create parameters related to user’s emotions such as sadness, anger, and depression, which can largely improve its ability to identify user’s intentions behind his or her move (e.g. asking a question or making a complaint). ', 'Built human-like voice assistant with better user experienceCreated potential benefits to students and their communitiesLearned research statistics related to mental health and how technology can help ', 'Prototyping is fun, although we faced many problems.

So far, the school has done a really good job: reduced electricity use by 16% and thermal energy by 13%. The school has been doing a great job so far, but as members of the community, we wonder: can we contribute to the process as individuals? Thus, our group came up with the idea to develop an App to help the students and faculties to participate in the mission and contribute their own effort.  ', ""It learns the user's long-term food preferences and recommends similar foods according to health-factors and eco-factors. The app can increase the usage frequency by giving feedbacks to users' food consumption, their daily carbon footprint and build a community. Here is the interaction procedure:In this part, we include a complete interaction process, including two parts. Environmental behavioural theory Theory of reasoned action (TRA) and theory of planned behaviour (TPB) are common theories used to investigate the factors associated with an individual’s environmental behaviours.Persuasive technology refers to an interactive product that is designed to evaluate changes in attitudes, behaviours and their interactionsThe first part is a pre-survey for first time users, we use environmental behavioral questions and carbon footprint awareness questionnaire (See Appendix 1) to generate personalized eco-friendly scores that’s based on the average carbon footprint of the Moho community. A five-point Likert scale ranging from one to five is used to score responses to each item in the constructs. Each item is constructed according to the national mean and standard deviation. There are two types of questions: a),behavioral questions: “On average, how long does it take you to take a shower? 1, less than 3 mins    2, 3-6 mins    3, 6-9 mins   4, 9-12 mins   5, 12 mins and aboveWe will score this question reversely, add 1 to the total score if the user select ‘12 mins and above. ’b) carbon footprint awareness:“Global warming problems have consequences for my life.”1 Strongly Disagree  2 Disagree 3 Neutral 4 Agree 5 Strongly AgreeWe will add 5 to the total score if the user select ‘Strongly Agree’The app will map the score to the distribution of all users’ scores and present a ranking.After the new user finished the first part, they will join the other users to the second part: Daily log and how to reduce your carbon footprint. It begins the long-term (stable) food preference elicitation. This is to collect what the user generally likes to eat. The user can browse a full catalog of recipes from Mount Holyoke College’s daily menu, and mark those that he/she has eaten or would like to eat that day. This is also the part where the user can specify their diet restrictions. In order to find food recommendations which both appeal the user’s appetite, help them to decrease their carbon dioxide emission and have balanced meals, an active learning technique, which is called User Utility Multidimensional Prediction, is used. We modify existing nutrient-based food recommender algorithm to include additional parameters that are used for modelling the dependencies between the environmental component and and the food preference and nutrition component.  "", 'Our first step is to calculate the average daily carbon footprint per capita. We scraped the numbers of annual water, electricity and fuel usage from the school website, multiply them by the carbon emission factor. There are approximately 2,335 students and 312 staff and faculties at Mount Holyoke last year, so we get the daily average carbon footprint per capita: 36012122.87/365/2647 = 37.27 ton/per day/ per personWe also want to take school’s recycling programs into consideration.

"EcoWarriors-A Social Game Challenge ","EcoWarriors-A Social Game Challenge To Bring Awareness and Action Toward Climate Change","[7149, ""We develop this project through our very personal experience. We deeply care about our environment. However, when we talk to our friends about the impact of climate change, they just feel like another lecture from Mr. or Ms. Environmentalist. They don't care about the topic because they feel like climate change is a big global issue and they can't do anything to change that. Moreover, many of my friends think climate change is just a scientific myth and they don't see any real impact of it in their daily lives. Therefore, through this Climathon, we get together as a team to develop a game app that can visually show the real impact of climate change and how the players can actually change the effect of it through daily activities. Project Description:My team develop a game called “EcoWarriors” to raise awareness about climate change.  Our goal is to help people change their daily habits and adopt a more sustainable lifestyle. Every action of the users will be tracked and converted to score, that score will be the metrics for the wellbeing of their virtual pet. These actions include: Reducing carbon footprint, Using more renewable energy, wasting Less water, reducing waste ( i.e. Changing to reusable shopping bags), choosing businesses that support green living (partners), recycling, walking instead of drivingGame Storyline:The global climate change becomes a huge problem on Earth and many animals are on the edge of extinction. To prevent the mass extinction from happening, the players will act as a wild-lives rescuers and each of them are assigned with a mysterious egg of an endangered animal. Each animal they are assigned will be the very last one of a species. The players will incubate each egg at the beginning stage of the game. After the players reach a certain score, the egg will reveal their assigned animal ( i.e. penguin, dolphin, whale, polar bear…) Depending on the player’s choice of challenge, a set of tasks will be shown. The tasks are daily action in a person’s life, and every completed task be tracked and converted to score. That score will be the metrics (such as air quality, water quality, energy consumption…) will contribute to the wellbeing of their virtual pet and the improvement of the environment in that animal’s habitat. With higher score level, the virtual animals will slowly bear more eggs and have a family of their own to bring their species out of extinction.  This game raise people’s awareness and educate us about the different sustainable in a friendly and fun way that even a kid can understand. This game is great for individuals or the whole family together. Methods for Score Tracking:Take photos of their electric bills, track decreaseShow receipts of restaurants/businessesTrack geolocation for milage of a person when they are walking or biking.Timing showers and water usageGreen membership card to use on bus or partnered green stores/restaurant/coffee shop/markets. Members with this cards can get discounted at those partnered store, too.Reward for Players:Creating “Badges” for each challenge (i.e. Reducing Plastic Waste)Every month, the community of this game will get together to celebrate the top scored players and listen to their journey of changing their daily habits toward a sustainable living goals. This will help fuel up the motivation of the players and build a stronger community full of exciting environmentally-mindful individual.Data Gathering & Visualization:Summarizing the statistic of average consumption of water and energy on a local-level. Training algorithm with real data to perfect our scoring system. Gathering data about local businesses and markets about their level of green-awareness. Using this data to improve users’ experience and connecting them with the right community partners and organizations which promote the sustainable and green living. Impact of Solutions:This game raise people’s awareness and educate us about the different sustainable in a friendly and fun way that even a kid can understand. This game is great for individuals or the whole family together. Therefore, even the ones who are not so interested in environmental issues before will start to be mindful about it through this game. Our ultimate goal is to raise people’s awareness on the topic of climate change and to motivate community to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle via this gamification project.Future Plan:We are developing the app and working on launching our beta version through limited invitation. Then, when we are confident with our final product, we will launch the official version on the app store and then working on promoting the app through advertising and words-of-mouth. When we have a good initial users base, we will work on building a bigger community. Every month, the community of this game will get together to celebrate the top scored players and listen to their journey of changing their daily habits toward a sustainable living goals. This will help fuel up the motivation of the players and build a stronger community full of exciting environmentally-mindful individual.On the data science side of this project, we will work on:Summarizing the statistic of average consumption of water and energy on a local-level.

"Puzzle of the Day","A daily crossword puzzle game - designed from the ground up only for Alexa","[10809, 'I\'ve always been interested in building games for voice, as voice is such a different medium than the visual ones we are bombarded with throughout the rest of our day. Voice games are a perfect time to sit back, use your imagination, and really immerse yourself in something, similar to reading a book. It activates your brain in ways you don\'t get from your phone, your TV, your consoles, or your computer.I\'ve built games for Alexa in the past, but for this competition I wanted to focus on something specific, and that was retention. Generally most voice games don\'y have great retention - you play it once, finish the content within a week or so, and you\'re over it. While that can provide for an engaging experience, it\'s not always the best path forward for something like ISP. To make some income, you really want people coming back time and time again.Despite the rise of technology in our day to day, and the decline of traditional newspapers, there is still a massive community of crossworld puzzlers around the globe. People still keep their subscriptions solely for the daily crossword. Crossword puzzles and their fun clues are an amazing brainteaser, forcing you to think deeply about words and their meanings, learning and having fun at the same time. Voice seemed like the perfect medium to translate this sort of experience. Voice games are especially great for those ""in-between times"". It\'s something you can do when you wake up, when you are doing the dishes, doing the laundry, driving etc. You may be doing something mindless with your hands, but still want to engage with your brain. These were the times of day I wanted to target.With an idea in mind, I set to work! ', ""Puzzle of the Day is a daily crossword puzzle style game. The puzzles are built from the ground up for Alexa, and are designed as quick 5-10 minute daily experiences.Each puzzle consists of five words, and a theme.It uses clues similar to those you may find in a crossword puzzle, but removes the crossing component from the game. Instead, solving words give you free 'letter reveals' which act in the same way, but you can be strategic about when to use them. If you are stumped on a hard word, you can pass and rack up some letter reveals to help you with that one later.Once the user guesses all five words, they can wager some points on the theme. Points are earned from solving words, having remaining letter reveals, as well as time bonus for finishing under 5, 10 and 15 minutes. You only get one guess for the theme, but guessing correctly with a high wager could let you double your points.Once solving each daily puzzle, you can see how your score compared to others around the world with an in game leaderboard, giving you your percentile and place for time and points for each day. Users who are more interested in the stats can link their accounts and access the online leaderboards that I built for the game. These are available at https://www.stokedskills.com/puzzleoftheday/You can also set up the email service to get a daily email at the end of the day, so you can see how you compared against all the users of the day (because when you play, you can only get stats for people who played thus far) "", ""There are a number of components to this skill:The skill code itself:I built this skill using the Jovo framework. It is developed in Node.js using typescript, and data for each user is being persisted to the skill in DynamoDb. The skill supports the APL interface and has full screen APL support across for all devices, throughout the whole game.The Leaderboards:The leaderboard data can be accessed within the skill, from the website, or from the email service. Leaderboard data is updated whenever a user finishes a puzzle, and is stored in and AWS RDS MySql instance.The Website:The website allows users to view their rankings on a 7 day / Last Month / All time basis. You can look up your user and see your scores for each puzzle you completed. This out of skill component was designed and built to help with user retention. It's built as a static site hosted and Amazon S3, written with javascript in VueJS. Data is accessed via a backend node API hosted in AWS Lambda and API Gateway using the serverless framework. The Email Service:To send emails to users, there is a recurring job each day.  Once a day is completed and we have everyone's scores, we can publish that days results. Using an AWS lambda running on a cron schedule daily, we load up all the scores from the database for the previous day for users that have requested emails. For those users, we calculate their individual stats for percentile and place in time and points and deliver it as an email using Twilio's SendGrid. This system was an integral part of the design as I really wanted to focus on user retention to drive adoption of the ISP.The ISP: For the In Skill Purchase component of the skill, I decided to go with subscriptions. Since I was focused on retention and daily usage, I figured that a recurring model would be the best approach for this skill. I've decided to brand the ISP as the puzzle league, and by subscribing users get extra benefits like more games, and the ability to reveal extra letters. The free component to the game is substantial, but by paying a small monthly fee, those dedicated users can get some extra enjoyment and fun. "", ""Because I wanted to build a game of high quality, I included alot of features which increased the scope. Besides the skill itself, I needed to build out the website, the database system for the in-skill leaderboards, and email system, and a content management framework. While building the skill itself, and all the other moving parts were quite a challenge and took lots of iteration to get right, I think the content management aspect was the most interesting challenge I had to face so I wanted to focus on that.Building a daily recurring game means more content every day. To make this word right and with accurate word recognition, I needed to include all of the solutions to the puzzles, including the themes, into the voice model. This means re-certifying with every new puzzle that is added. I could have taken a more risky approach and used an 'open' slot with SearchQuery, but I really wanted the accuracy to be top notch so I took the more involved approach.To get all the data into the skill, I needed a great way to manage the content. Instead of managing the puzzle content in code, I decided it would be way easier to use spreadsheets. In the spreadsheet I can fill in the solutions, the clues, and the themes.From there, I needed to get it into the slots of the skill, and access it from within my skill code. To do so, I built a number of deployment scripts. These scripts are used to do a number of things:Import the spreadsheet into code and convert it into JSON, so the skill code can use it to provide the right puzzlesAutomatically fill in dates and data for all the new puzzles that are addedRun some verification on the generated JSON file to make sure there are no duplicate dates, puzzleIds, etcTake all the words I need from the JSON file in the voice model, (clue answers and theme names) and open up the voice model json file, update the slot values, and save it back to disk so that I could use that to upload to the Alexa service.Upload all the puzzle data into MySql so the website has access to the correct puzzle dataThese scripts allow me to do all the data management I need in only a minute or so, saving me alot of time and potential errors in the future. With this system, I plan to create skill content every 2-3 months, and then update the skill with that data, giving me a nice worry-free window in case things are slow with certification. By automating the process, I can make all those above updates that are pretty far reaching into all of the infrastructure and code of the entire system, without touching the code myself. This really limits the vectors for failure and allows me to spend more of my time focusing on how to improve the game for customers. "", ""With all the moving parts, this was probably the most complicated and in depth skill I've built. It's the first one I've built using Subscriptions as an ISP. After spending alot of time on the design, and considering cutting alot of the scope, I'm proud that I completed everything I set out to do, and that I designed it in an efficient and scalable way that requires little maintenance. I'm excited to see how it performs now that its out there in the wild!  "", ""Skill development is an amazing learning process, and I learned a ton with this project. While I had experience with some of these technologies before, I took steps to learn and include more technologies whenever I got the chance. For example, as part of this project I learned Typescript and built the entire skill using it. Being my first time using Typescript, it took at bit of studying up, but I think it paid off in the end and my skill is far more maintainable that it would have been without it. I also learned the importance of user testing. As part of the process, I recruited people that I knew to act as beta testers and play through the game for a few weeks before the release. This really allowed me to tweak the difficulty and gameplay and find a level where I think people will gain the most possible enjoyment. As I went through a couple iterations of this I found that each and every piece of feedback I acted on had an immediate effect on the next group of people I had try the game. It's definitely a process that I will continue doing on future projects.  "", ""Now that I have everything set up and rolling, the next step is to iterate and improve the experience. Nothing is ever quite perfect on the first try, and that is why I set up a feedback system within the skill. Each day, users can rate the quality of the puzzle. This is stored into my database and I can use it to help me understand what is working and what isn't as I build more puzzles for the future.In addition, I want to iterate on the ISP. I want to find more ways to add value to subscribers with the potential for weekly challenge puzzles, or monthly competitions. I'd love to build out an A/B testing framework for this game so I can truly identify what is working and make smart analytical decisions about where to invest my time next.

"That's Obvious: A Trivial Dilemma","It's a fun trivia game... with a splash of drama!","[4754, ""I've been working on assistant-based programming for over 15 years now. Also back then, my partner Kelli and I came up with a road trip game that worked like a combination of 20 questions and a verbal crossword puzzle for famous people's names. The two passions have come together to create That's Obvious, and here we have the latest flavor: A Trivial Dilemma! "", ""Trivial Dilemma is a gameshow with 5 rounds. Each round has a secret famous name that the player(s) are trying to figure out. Each round starts off with an impossible clue and gives you more and more clues. Each clue makes it more obvious AND doubles the current pot (so even if you know the answer, you may want to hold out for more $$$). The player who gets the secret name wins the round's pot, and whoever has the most $$$ at the end of the game wins. BUT! Each round can pit a player with a moral dilemma, where she must make a tough decision between winning the game and winning friends. "", ""I started making Alexa Skills at the very beginning, and I developed my own Alexa Skills framework in TypeScript called ask-gib. It's evolved over the years, and this skill gave me the chance to include & test the ISP workflow. I have the build/deploy process as a single command in vscode, which builds, zips and deploys the skill to the AWS lambda function (the $LATEST alias). Then I made use of the Developer Console's awesome new Alexa Simulator and Voice & Tone tools, which have vastly sped up the debug cycle compared to testing on the physical device. I also used the console to create an ISP product, which was very straight-forward and well-documented. For debugging, I still have been using logging and CloudWatch, but I'm looking forward to incorporating the new client-side proxy for debugging locally.  "", 'Aside from the normal (tough) challenges of programming in general, my main challenge was in reconciling the pay-to-play aspect of In Skill Products and my desire to make it available and fully functional to those who are unable to afford any products. That\'s how I came up with the PayItForwardIntent invoked by ""Pay It Forward"". This sets a flag in code that indicates that all packs are available. When checking for available content, the code checks for entitled products or this flag.  So the skill works exactly as if the user paid for the product. When she is ready to support me, she can say ""Pay It Back"" which toggles the flag off and gives her the list of available products.This is actually why I\'ve kept away from ISP in the first place, but I think this is a good solution to the issue.  ', 'In addition to the above Pay It Forward solution (which I\'m most proud of!) and getting the skill working in general, I\'m also proud of the variety of speech involved with the skill. I am able to accomplish this with my lex-gib library, which works both as i18n and idiomatic alternatives. So in addition to having a single translation into other languages, this allows for multiple translations in multiple languages with single line of calling code. So in code I can write a single line calling for the ""bye"" speech (text and/or ssml), and depending on language/weighting and other options, I\'ll get speech like ""Bye"", ""Bye-Bye"", ""Later"", ""Ciao"", ""Arrivaderci"", ""Tschuss"", etc. In combination with other features of the library, this provides robust dynamism in the voice interaction. ', ""I've learned to use some of the new tools made available for testing Alexa Skills, as well as the nice ISP workflow. This includes how to create a product, how to get a list of products and entitlements for the user, how to form the ISP directive and give flow control over to the Alexa Service and how to resume control flow after a purchase is accepted/declined. "", 'There are always so many small improvements to make, but the main thing to do now is to create more free and ISP expansion content! Also I have ideas for when to prompt the user with an UPSELL and overall get more dynamic interaction with respect to available content and other updates. Ultimately an open-data expansion pack system to go along with the open-source skill itself would create the absolute best experience for the consumers. This way, those who are good at generating the trivia (and dramatic dilemmas!) can do their thing and those who are good at generating the code can do theirs...what an experience that could be!

But then I decided that adults can play it as well. That's how I've started working on the Capitalist Journey. "", ""As in a real world you get your 9 to 5 job, weekly payroll and you rent your apartment.Each turn in the game equals to one week, so you get your weekly payroll, once a month you need to pay your rent.You also can buy businesses and real estate properties, both ways can help you to generate an additional cashflow.  Obviously you need somehow to save money in order to buy these assets.You can make some money by flipping stuff online aka side hustle :)Sometimes some event can happen, for example it's your friend's birthday and you need to buy a gift. Or to pay taxes. You need to be prepared for such events as in real life. Each consecutive day of playing will give users an additional bonus.For those people who want to speed up the process, there are several premium packs available which give a boost to your bank account. "", 'Using Jovo Framework + Ruby/Rails API app + MySql ', ""The main challenge is to understand what could be interesting to people. And developing the game can be even more challenging in this area, cause, for the most part, you can't validate your assumptions  "", ""Couple times I was thinking that nobody will play it, I was considering switching to another ideas. So I'm glad that I've finished it. "", ""Don't underestimate who long will it take to develop even the MVP of the game.Check the invocation name before publishing the skill. I've used the 'empire builder' name and then realized that there is an existing skill with the same name. So I've removed the live skill and submitted another one with the new name.  "", ""First and foremost I want if it will be interesting for people.But if I assume that people will play the game, then there are many options how I can improve it. Some of the ideas: Scoreboard. Bring some competition to the game.Add more options how users could earn moneyDevelop some kind of 'reputation/status badges', so if you buy some large apartment, your status is increasing and your get more options after that.Make it more realistic and allow to take loans in order to buy business or property.

That is why our primary focus is to connect them to nearby businesses that will offer discounts and benefits to verifiable evacuees.

First, and most importantly, these companies can contribute to easing the financial and physical discomfort of victims. This is an opportunity for corporate benevolence and community involvement.

Unfortunately I was unable to fully implement them, but I have lots of ideas about having different parts of the save file partially encrypted, or multiple layers of encryption by different asymmetric, or symmetric key systems, to create parts of rooms that are harder to get access to.  Different parts of the file would be encrypted in different ways, and at different strengths.  The players would have control over things that were encrypted and how.  The game would be about aquiring resources in order to out-cypher your enemies.  As your cryptographic power increases during the game, you would be able to decrypt more and more of your opponent's parts of the file, to eventually locate them and destroy them.  This game would use a save file to store the game state at varying levels of encryption.  Anyone who runs the game with that file would be able to join into that round of the game, as long as they can send the file back to the other participants (with their moves added to the mix).  I actually see this file sharing mechanism as a big strength for flexibility and interesting concepts in the game (security risks aside lol).  It also allows people without a strong or stable internet connection to participate.

The user can add the app into their Slack workspace, then follow the setup process to connect with their own Canvas account, then they would be able to fetch the current course list from Canvas. ', 'We used the transposit for transferring data from Canvas to Slack. By default, transposit has native support for Slack, so that can be used. However, it does not have support for Canvas. So we used SwaggerHub to create an (incomplete) OpenAPI 3.0 compatible definition of the Canvas LMS REST API. With API definition we created a Canvas Connector on transposit. Then it is possible to use SQL to query items from Canvas. ', 'In the Canvas API, the way they implement the parameter serialization is weird. Instead of the normal way of doing like ""list=item0&list=item1"", ""list=item0,item1""or ""list[0]=item0&list[1]=item1"", they decided to implement it as ""list[]=item0&list[]=item1"". This way of doing serialization is not supported in OpenAPI. This is fine, it can still be described with OpenAPI. Just rename the parameter from list to list[], then use the normal explode serialization. However this is acceptable when calling in the SQL, or probably from many other languages, as item[] is not a legal parameter name. So far we had to leave it out for now.Another challenge is the key expiration. Token from Canvas can have a expiration duration. Manually generated token never expires, so that\'s fine. However, token requested by third-party applications such as this bot via OAuth 2.0 would expire in 1 hour. The application need to refresh the token at least every hour. Transposit uses a ""managed authentication"" flow, where the token is managed by the transposit. Luckily it provided a ""runtime"" authentication method, allowing the application script to fetch the token. Though the application is unable to store the new refreshed token back, it may just use the token for the first time, then store all new tokens to user settings as a setting. However this is not perfect, runtime authentication cannot be used in conjunction with OAuth 2 managed authentication, making it rather hard for user to setup their account for the first time.

But their are certain quirks in Canvas that doesn't well translate to transposit's expected interface.

Additionally, while there are existing estimates for some products, it is very difficult to accurately differentiate between products that are very similar.

"Project Grizzly ","Project Grizzly is a forest fire prediction and locating network utilizing smart devices. We gather data along with wildlife travel patterns to better predict and locate possible forest fires.","[5039, ""We were inspired and motivated by the countless forest fires in California. The number of forest fires has been increasing consistently every year in California. Most solutions so far are off ground solutions. These projects don't gather data from the ground where fires actually take place. Our goal is to use environmental data and animal behavior to predict and locate potential areas where forest fires can start. The name Project Grizzly comes from California's state animal, which is a grizzly bear. California is an example location of where our network could work.  "", 'Project Grizzly is not a single IoT device, it is a network of data gathered by smart devices and then processed by machine learning algorithms. Here is how everything is connected: Project Grizzley uses wildlife behavior to track patterns in movement to locate potential fires starting. Large mammals such as elk, deer, and grizzly bears are known to not only act quickly but also act before fires become largely detectable. Inserting GPS tracking systems into animals allows us to view when a change in their behavior occurs. For example, elk and deer run towards bodies of water when fires break out. If Project Grizzley’s algorithm sees a large population of deer and elk moving towards bodies of water, then there is a strong change a certain portion of the forest is engulfed in fire.  Project Grizzly uses five foot tall rod to detect biomass density and environmental changes to assess potential outbreaks of fire. Forest fires feed off of dense leaf and plantae coverage. Knowing which portions of the forest have a growing collection of dead leaves and thick moss allows us to know where to be wary of forest fires. The ROD gathers this data using… It then sends this data via satellite using satellite networking solutions such as Abela by Inmarsat. This data gets processed by Project Grizzly and then is determined to be potentially dangerous or not. Data acquisition and analysis is what makes Project Grizzley so powerful. The use of various data sets along with machine learning algorithms, allows Project Grizzley to predict and locate potential forest fires in continuously changing ecosystem. Project Grizzley uses MongoDB to store data from the ROD and GPS tracking systems. This data is then processed through IBM Watson to get probability values of forest fires occurring in specific locations. Project Grizzly adjusts and gathers data for unique environments. Every ROD and tracking group gathers data for a specific location, which allows us to monitor precise areas.   ', 'Essentially our data from our GPS tracking system and ROD device is sent to our MongoDB server using the satellite technology, Abela by Inmersat. This data is then processed by our model in IBM - Watson. ', 'The biggest technical challenge we ran into was using IBM - Watson to run data processing tasks on our data set.The next challenge was product design. We spent a lot of time trying to figure out was Project Grizzly is and what exactly it does.  ', 'Going off of the challenges we faced, we are very proud of the vision of Project Grizzly and what it is designed to do. We think our network design is unique and well thought out. Our intended network is complex but solves its intended problem with sensible solutions. Tracking animals and having a biomass and local environment sensor makes a lot of sense.  ', 'We learned a decent amount of MongoDB and IBM Watson technology. We realized a new, at least for us, usage for both of these technologies. It was also the first time a couple of us tied together data acquisition with machine learning.  ', 'The next step immediate step for Project Grizzly would be to use a prototype ROD to gather biomass and weather data from a local environment. We want to then process this data and see what we can model from data processing. We would also like to gather GPS data for animal patterns and run it into machine learning algorithms like IBM Watson. Though, this animal tracking step is a little more resource heavy than a prototype ROD. If we were to carry out this project down the road, we believe that a sufficient prototype network consists of tracking systems in a small population of grizzly bears, elk, and deer along with dozens of ROD devices placed in different parts of forests. At this point even tho we would not have much data, we would want to still process it in relatively real time through a satellite and into our machine learning model.

"safetyNET","Decentralized P2P Clusters for disaster-struck areas with no technological infrastructure","[4452, 'Coming into hackRPI, our team had a pretty clear idea of what we wanted to create. At the opening ceremony, we were all a bit shocked after the video about IBM\'s top hackathon winner, project OWL. Our idea, to a tee. Back to the drawing board. First, we looked a little deeper into what project OWL does exactly. We learned that each of their networks are client-server models, with ""PapaDucks"" acting as servers, and individual ducks as clients. Additionally, we realized that their product is mainly the physical network, not software on that network for disaster survivors.We decided that our goal was to help survivors in the event of internet and cellular service loss maintain their ability to stay informed and communicate with the people around them with already-existing technology in their pockets. ', 'SafetyNET is a communications service run over a custom-built decentralized peer-to-peer network. Main functionality so far includes: network-wide chat and disaster relief information spreading.Our chatroom is quite simple. Since every node in the network can connect directly to every other node, whenever the user enters a chat message, every other user receives it. This allows quick, scalable chatting. Through an IBM cloud object storage resource, we set up a ""bucket"" in which we, or in the future first responders, news outlets, and disaster alert services, can store the most relevant data to disaster survivors. Then, when a machine running our p2p network detects that it can connect to the internet, it downloads this data, reconnects to the network, and sends it to all the other machines on the network. This way, even just one person getting access to the internet allows many people to receive potentially life-saving information. ', ""We wrote everything in python. The P2P network files run a built-in module 'socket', which acts as a door to send and receive data packets between computers.The communication between the IBM Cloud and our network goes through a module 'ibm_boto3' which allows python to extract data from the Cloud and return a string with the contents of the chosen file in the bucket. "", 'Multiprocessing: A large goal of our project was allowing the P2P network to multiprocess, i.e. giving each node in the network the ability to send and receive packets simultaneously. This concept is the epitome of peer-to-peer networking, making it the largest difference from a client-server network. ', ""Our peer to peer network had to be custom-built due to some of the requirements we had for it and the lack of high-quality modules available on python for peer to peer networking. This was quite a challenge, very enjoyable, and something we are very proud of being successful with.Using the ibm_boto3 python module, we built a program to connect to our IBM Cloud Object Storage Resource, read off the list of buckets, go into a bucket and extract the file(s), and parse the body of the files into a string. Our IBM COS Resource is the main database for our entire project, so implementing our network to extract that data and send it through the network was a huge step.The two main parts of our core tech are the peer-to-peer network and the ability to extract data from the IBM COS. Both of these are functional and stable, so we have deemed this project as a success.What's next for safetyNETWe would love to implement multiprocessing to allow nodes on the network to receive and send messages and packets at the same time, which is a major quality of P2P networks.

"", 'With the use of a Raspberry Pi 4, we were able to run a computing-intensive program to return real-time outputs. This project required quite the bit of coding in order to provide an output based on a large set of edge cases. Along with this, we had to develop a UI that utilized all sensor inputs and calculated the safest routes to take for the user. All of the sensors had to be run through a breadboard in order to interface with the Raspberry Pi (Other than the PiCamera). Along with this, we had to run testing calibrations on the Ultrasonic Sensor in order to provide accurate proximity measurements, as a singular camera does not provide depth perception.  ', '1.) We spent hours on this, but one of the hardest parts was interfacing all the sensors outputs with one another. We had to have all of the sensor inputs work in sync to provide accurate readings. Unfortunately, there is no simple way to apply this, so we had to learn how to multithread multiple files. 2.) While the Raspberry Pi 4 is a powerful machine for its size, it was still lacking performance. To accurately be able to trace the environment and return accurate commands to the user we need around 20 fps from the processed footage in real-time. While we were unable to attain such high performance we found solutions that would help our project development in the future.

For example, a feature that counts the amount of pro/con keywords in the employees’ discussions, and formulates a bar graph based on the occurrences of the keywords, proving whether or not the common consensus of a decision is positive or negative. Along with that, we would like to create a machine learning program that uses the discussions to check whether or not the employees will like a certain decision which will be made.

"QuickCards","Learn quick with QuickCards, we provide a new and more efficient way to study for tests by self generating QuickCards from your own personal notes to a traditional flash card. ","[4226, ""Being passionate about academics, it frustrated us to see many students struggle academically due to inefficient study techniques. We observed many of our peers spend their limited study time before their exams, on tasks such as flashcard creation. Flashcards have proven to be one of the most effective ways to study, utilizing many metacognitive faculties and engaging active recall, which is crucial for memorization and studying. However, because of the laborious nature of re-writing one's entire course material on flashcards just to be able to review from them, many find it not worthwhile to spend time creating them. We came to UB Hacking to solve this issue for students by utilizing computer vision on students' notes to automate the process of flashcard creation. "", ""Quick Cards allows a student to scan their notes, and uses Google's Cloud Vision API for handwriting detection and OCR to process their notes, and generate flashcards based on them. It currently features a web-based interface which allows its users to upload a picture of their notes, typically taken by their phone. It then makes an API call to Google Cloud Vision service, which captures the location of the elements on the notes and parses the handwriting into text. "", ' ', 'One of the challenges we ran into was first with the detection of the boxes of text. The boxes formed around areas of words with high word density were overlapping with other paragraphs which made it hard to distinguish between the block and this caused the algorithm to ineffectively distinguish between the key (i.e the title) and value (i.e the explantation). Due to this, it would be hard to insert the word/question on one side of the flashcard and the answer/definition on the other side.  ', 'We managed to detect text from images and converted that into flashcards. We managed to stay awake for the whole night and worked on our project. On a serious note, we managed to understand the Google Cloud vision API, implement our own techniques to optimize the detection. We configured the bounds on the boxes made by making an algorithm which figures out the corner coordinates of the rectangles and situates the correct boxes made around the world and the definition. On the front end side using a serverless cloud function API with a website allowing the user to upload the notes as a .jpg and outputs the generated flash cards.

"ecoShopper","Shop the green way","[4871, ""What inspired us to create this product? Apathy is the word!Data from Climate Change in the American Mind surveys show that around 73% of Americans think global warming is happening and almost 69% say that they are worried about climate change. Seems like a promising number right? But, according to Nielsen, in the U.S. sales of products with sustainable attributes make up to only 22% of the total store, with organic, sustainable and clean attributes driving the majority of the sustainable category’s growth.Thus we can observe, there is a vast gap between awareness and the percentage of people who are actually taking the extra steps to act on it. However, all’s not lost; here’s the silver lining. Nielsen also points out that around 75% of millennials are willing to change their purchase/consumption habits in order to reduce the impact of the environment. This is where ecoShopper comes in. We make use of the positive willingness of the millennials and the consumers in them and try to influence them, by giving the right impetus, towards greener steps. Our chrome extension and web application aims to play on the users' tendencies and make it more convenient for them to notice and buy Eco-friendly products.Action: What ecoShopper does?ecoShopper is a Chrome Extension that offers alternative Eco-friendly products as suggested products when a customer adds any product to his/her shopping cart. It includes a web dashboard, which keeps track of user data and presents various metrics of how their shopping activity affects the environment. Thus making the user aware of his/her contributions and keeping him/her motivated about helping the environment.Creation:The initial phase of the project involved the creation of a Chrome extension. For the chrome extension, we had to use javascript primarily for all the functionalities and JSON for the manifest. The main focus of the extension was to search for similar eco-friendly products as to ones enlisted in the cart of an eCommerce site. We achieve that by using an API along with our NLP - RAKE model which extracts keywords from the cart's products and feeds it to the API to get similar eco-friendly products. Beyond this, we have also created a web dashboard that would help the user keep track of his changes. In that, we measure various metrics like savings in terms of emission, materials ( plastic, etc. ) and also showcasing overall contribution of all users to motivate each user to do better. Challenges:There were various challenges we encountered, few of which were related to the extension development which none of us had done before. Few were related to the google cloud app engine since it is meant for a proper Production environment. Hence, we had to apply appropriate techniques to get it set for our application. It consumed a lot of time, but was worth developing since dealing with issues was easier once it was set up since it was a prod environment and debugging was cleaner. Accomplishments:Created a chrome extension from scratch with minimal external assistanceBypassed various hurdles in terms of unavailability of Amazon API( only available for associates ) which was our basic framework when we were planning it. Developed a flask web app in a Prod environment to be pushed into the Google Cloud App EngineTakeaways: What we learnedLearnt how to build an extensionLearnt how to build web applications in a Production environment In the process of learning about our target audience, we realized how many people actually want to make changes for the environment, but don't have enough information to act on it in their busy livesUsed NLP-RAKE model and analysis of various other models for short sized keyword extractionScope:  What's next for ecoShopperEcoShopper can have varied applications in the real-world. We intend to expand it to a mobile application that not only gives the user an alternative for shopping stuff, but at other daily activities too. For example, if a user intends to take a cab ride, ecoShopper should give the user alternative eco-friendly options like walking, taking a bike ride or taking the bus. We intend ecoShopper act as the required impetus in order to influence people to take greener steps.Built Withbootstrapchromecssflaskgoogle-cloudhtml5javascriptnatural-language-processingnltkpythonsqlTry it outecoproduct-257823.appspot.comgithub.com      Submitted to    HackDuke: Code for Good 2019Winner                Most Viable Hack                  Created by  Worked on some parts of the extension and the flask serverArul Thileeban SagayamMay KPRERONA DUTTAtonyrubensjp "", ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['css', 'html5', 'flask', 'google-cloud', 'chrome', 'javascript', 'sql', 'natural-language-processing', 'nltk', 'python', 'bootstrap']","False","0","['rocknroll9898', 'pdutta3', 'arulthileeban023', 'antonybstack', 'rubensjp']","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/880/894/datas/small.png","False","0"

"Autism Speaks","""if you've met an individual with autism ,you've met one individual with autism "". Approximately 1% (7.5 billion) of the global population is affected by autism and we are here to help them .  ","[5894, 'Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment condition associated with significant healthcare costs, and early diagnosis can significantly reduce these. The economic impact of autism and the increase in the number of ASD cases across the world reveals an urgent need for the development of easily implemented and effective screening methods. Therefore, a time-efficient and accessible ASD screening is imminent to help health professionals and inform individuals whether they should pursue formal clinical diagnosis. The rapid growth in the number of ASD cases worldwide necessitates datasets related to behaviour traits. However, such datasets are rare making it difficult to perform thorough analyses to improve the efficiency, sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of the ASD screening process. Presently, very limited autism datasets associated with clinical or screening are available and most of them are genetic in nature.  ', 'Hence, we propose a new dataset related to autism screening of adults that contained 20 features to be utilised for further analysis especially in determining influential autistic traits and improving the classification of ASD cases.With just the help of these features - including sample questionnaires and some birth facts, we have provided a Machine Learning model that can evaluate the chances of a person being diagnosed with autism with an accuracy of around 80%.  ', 'We took Autism Screening Questionnaires and developed a set of features with the output being in a binary format of 0 or 1 evaluating or NO or a YES.Some of these Questions were as follows:. has a deviant style of communication with a formal, fussy, old-fashioned or “robotlike” language          invents idiosyncratic words and expressionshas a different voice or speechexpresses sounds involuntarily; clears throat, grunts, smacks, cries or screamsis surprisingly good at some things and surprisingly poor at othersuses language freely but fails to make adjustment to fit social contexts or the needs of different listenerslacks empathymakes naïve and embarrassing remarkshas a deviant style of gazewishes to be sociable but fails to make relationships with peerscan be with other children but only on his/her termslacks best friendlacks common senseis poor at games: no idea of cooperating in a team, scores “own goals”.We also had other features such as ethnicity, gender etc.The dataset was then refined in order to reduce the features by cutting down the ones that weighted a lot less by having very little significance on the output classification.We deployed the model in 2 phases: Used several distinct classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest and an Ensemble Classifier to get the best possible trained model and evaluate it based on past models used. Ran the model on Google Colab.Used IBM Watson to generate a model for the refined data we had. It made it easier since it showed 4 pipelines with different hyper-parameters tuning. We created a model and deployed the same to be used on our mobile devices as a service. ', 'Overfitting was the most serious problem we had. Finding the correct ratio of bias vs variance was really difficult to find as some features were being overweighed by our models thereby making the other features redundant.This was more prominently happening on IBM Watson as it tries to derive the best possible model by running huge number of epochs and iterations over the model thereby overfitting it.As far as manual running was concerned, we reduced overfitting by tuning the hyper-parameters such as reducing the number of epochs, using different models to come up with a better fit for unseen inputs, etc.For IBM Watson, we observed that the testing data was very less as it automatically uses only 5% of the data for testing and 95% for training. So the model is overtrained on a number of examples it observes. We increased the amount of testing data to 30%.After that, we had to make altercations with the data, as it was not consistent with data types, thereby causing problems in giving a better result.So we made the data consistent with data types and the model started giving way better results.We saved this model and deployed it for using it as a service. ', 'Waiting times for an ASD diagnosis are lengthy and procedures are not cost effective. By using our methodology of incorporating Machine Learning with probable screening questionnaires, we will be able to cull out these problems and it will be viable for everyone to use. This is a model created with keeping people in mind. We want to make sure that everyone is given an equal and proper chance to diagnose their child with autism. ', 'We were able to learn the AutoAI feature of IBM Cloud and how using it can save considerable time and space. Apart from that, we were able to effectively run and train the model on Google Colab which was furthermore a big advantage for us.

"SafeZone","Save lives with the touch of a button","[5289, 'The City of Ottawa is currently upgrading their hospitals to a new electronic health record system, and rather than speeding up the process, the slow learning curve for the system has drastically increased wait times for emergency response teams. One of our team-mates hosted a tournament where a player tore their achilles, when 911 was called it was estimated that the ambulance would come in 1 hour. When a victim is in an emergency situation, receiving immediate first aid could save their life. For example, a non-breathing victim who receives CPR immediately has a much higher chance of survival than someone who waited for an ambulance to arrive. Our team member Hari, who is certified in First Aid and CPR, realized that there are many people who are certified to be able to provide basic First Aid and perhaps minor treatment for a person in need. So he came up with the idea of an app that can instantly connect a person in need to nearby First Responders.  ', 'Using SafeZone, a user can call for help after which they will immediately connected to a nearby First Responder. Depending on the severity of the situation, the user will be advised to still call 911. Once the Responder is on the way, he/she will be able to contact the user who requested help to provide helpful instructions or get to know the situation before arriving. In an ideal scenario, the Responder reaches the user and provides First Aid until EMS arrives. In order for a user to be recognized as a First Responder on SafeZone, they must upload certification and wait for approval.  ', ""SafeZone was built as an Android application using Kotlin and Android Studio. We wanted the app to be clean in terms of design and for the user experience to be easy. So we made a very detailed design on Figma with all the views and app-flows before starting the development of the app. Google Firebase is powering our authentication, database, storage, and backend functions. We're using Google Cloud Platform/Google Maps API to get user location, calculating routes and distances. "", 'During the course of the hackathon we ran into a few challenges. The most prominent ones included some aspect of troubleshooting the google maps API. It was challenging to retrieve the location of the user, along with calculating the location of the closest first responder. In order for the google maps API to function properly, the user must provide some permissions that enable services. Setting these permission also brought up some challenges such as what happens if a user rejects the permission request.  ', 'We were able to produce a full minimum viable product over this 37 hour hackathon, from building a thorough design flow to implementing the basic functions of SafeZone. Though we ran into many technical road blocks along the way, we were able to overcome them all by making use of the expertise of each of our team members and staying organized throughout our design and build process. We established a clear work flow which focused the direction of our project and created a clean foundation for SafeZone.  ', ""Each member of our team has a different strength which was super cool because we were all able to learn so much from each other. For example, we all learned a lot about good design principles from Aarthi who is an amazing designer. With regards to the app itself, we chose to code in Kotlin which we knew almost nothing about. We literally learned a completely new language and built a working application with it which is awesome. Towards the half-way point, we decided that at a hackathon it's not worth it to nit-pick on minor details/issues, we could have saved a lot of time if we kept pushing forward to work on the main features - definitely something we learned for next time. "", ""Our team is really passionate about the idea which sparked SafeZone. We will finish the app, clean it up, add all the basic features it needs, and try to launch it in a city (probably Ottawa our hometown). We want to reach out to hospitals/first aid societies and share our idea to see if it can make a big impact. If we can save lives with this app, we're all in for it!

When customers arrive at an airport, they are unfamiliar with, they want something convenient and easy to help them in this situation. We wanted to establish a way to make a more productive and structured way for customers to obtain all of the needed information for their flights in one place.

Not only that, but it will send a notification reminding you before your plane starts to board. It will send notifications on if your flight is delayed or cancelled and even if there is a change in the gate you’re departing from.  ', 'To build the app, we used an app generator. We first decided to write about who we were and what the app was supposed to accomplish and incorporate that into the app. After, that we decided to include our contact information and frequently asked questions to have the façade of a business. Once we established on the app that we were a business, we included sections for boarding passes, flight information, and airport maps. These, in our opinions, are what the essentials of air travel are. With that, we included reminders to check-in to obtain your boarding pass and when you’re flight is starting to board.  ', 'Some challenges we ran into were first trying to establish an idea for our project. We were scattered all over the place, trying to incorporate something that all of us were passionate about.

ChallengesOur challenges consist of, but are not limited to the following:The first challenge we faced was traversing our UI with basically only the arrow keys and the ability to enter into a region and exit a region. It still isn't as perfect as we would like, but it's not too difficult to get to any certain part of the interface.The second hurdle was getting XCode and Swift updated and setup. Never having setup a project like this we struggled getting our assets in place and dependencies taken care of. The third thing we struggled through was socket connections between the Swift client and the Node.js server. We had received data with Node before, but never sent data with Swift, so that was an adventure. Swift's looseness with types was confusing at times and XCode's unclear error messages were misleading.Built WithcssshellswifttypescriptTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    SquirrelHacks    Created by  I created the Swift application to control TV with through iOS devices.

"Augmented Reality Runway Overlay System","An AR overlay displayed on the plane windshield displaying important markers on the runway that could be otherwise obscured by inclement weather.","[3635, ""We were inspired by the tragic events that can occur due to limited visibility and inclement weather. We wanted to reduce the risk associated with these events and reduce the amount of fatal accidents that can occur on the runway.What It DoesThis system would work in tandem with the ASDE and SMGCS systems already installed in over 60 major airports across the country. Receiving the signals already being sent by those markers from the ATC, planes would be convert those inputs to visual cues projected on the dashboard, allowing pilots to see important features when visibility may be extremely limited.How It WorksWe used two radios and programmed them to communicate with each other as a transmitter and receiver. Showing that we can receive inputs and then we would be able to convert these inputs to augmented reality overlays based on positions in space. We also coded an augmented reality applet that shows exactly how it would work and what it would look like. In addition to these two, we also created a video of a simulated landing, pausing at certain points and showing what the display on the windshield approximately would look like.Challenges We FacedProgramming the communication of the two radios proved to be a tad difficult.

The issue is that this ransomware will allow you to recover your files that it encrypts, albeit at a cost, and in addition, it has been cracked and a master key is available that will decrypt most versions of the ransomware. So, for this project, we decided to turn Petya, an infuriating but recoverable ransomware into a completely irreversible and malicious piece of code that causes fatal damage to Windows PCs.

While the payload operates, performance of your PC will drastically drop and applications will run slower. Shortly after, the PC will crash and a Blue Screen of Death will open.

Secondly, it eliminates any privacy concerns as the live video feed is never stored or exposed to the internet, ensuring that you are in control of your own data.

"FireVision","A modern approach to forest fire detection and containment using computer vision and machine learning.","[5158, 'Fire detection systems are essential safety devices that have been around for some time now. Of these, traditional particulate-based smoke-detection devices are the most common, yet unfortunately, these are not always suitable for use in certain areas. Namely, large open areas such as national parks require staffers in fire lookout towers to observe the surrounding landscape for signs of smoke or fire throughout the year; however, it costs money and time to hire these staffers and build fire lookout towers. ', ""In response to this issue, we have used computer vision and machine learning algorithms to automate the process of surveying these kinds of areas for signs of fire. This way, only a few cameras placed sparsely apart are needed to monitor the surrounding wilderness, drastically reducing the cost of this operation. Whenever a camera sees an image that the algorithm recognizes as a fire, it notifies the central system immediately with information about the fire's coordinates, allowing rangers to respond quickly and efficiently. "", 'We tried to recognize smoke as our main part of a project, since the first indicator of a forest fire is the smoke rising from the ground. The main processing part of the project was built using Google Cloud. We used the Auto-ML machine vision library to recognize and supply the bounding boxes for any smoke that was detected. Our model was a custom trained one, which required us to upload large numbers of sample images, and manually mark them. After that was done, we simply sent a request to the Google Cloud server based on each frame of our video feed and parsed the results to display the video on our website in real-time. Another significant part of our project was the real time tracking of data that had been identified by Auto-ML. Since each camera is fixed, we know the GPS coordinate of that camera. When the camera detects smoke, a notification pops up on our website, indicating that a certain number of fires were found, as well as a detailed Google Maps panel pointing to the fires. This makes monitoring the system extremely easy.  ', 'One major challenge we faced was how our model was incorrectly recognizing background clouds as smoke. We tried a few things. First, we converted the image into binary black/white, and only recognize parts where the whiteness of the smoke was seen over the black background. This however, proved to be too unreliable due to the varying thicknesses of the smoke involved. Second, since smoke starts from the ground, we attempted to filter out results based on whether it crossed the horizon in our image, but we realized smoke that was already far up in the air would be classified as clouds in this process. We finally decided to train another model, based upon only the starting location of the smoke, intentionally capturing some of the surrounding ground in the process. This proved to be the most reliable model throughout our tests. ', 'Although we did not accomplish all of the goals we set out to do, we are still glad that we were able to get pretty far. This was the first time that both of us worked with Google Cloud, computer vision, and web development, let alone all three in the same project.

Lastly, both of us had trouble before integrating our separate parts into one coherent project, but this time, we collaborated more efficiently, and were able to do this more seamlessly due to long term planning, and preventative coding.

We also had to deal with some advanced material, such as training and optimizing machine learning models, which required us to do some research into both the theory and the accepted practices that people use. ', 'Currently, the main limitation of our project is how we rely on visual data to detect smoke. This means that our ability to detect smoke during the night is severely restricted. A possible solution to this would be to incorporate not only just visual data into our algorithm, but also infrared data based on the temperature gradient between rising smoke and the air around it.

Provide them a boost charge, i.e. some kind of portable therapy on the phone to keep them positive and refreshed. This inspired the creation of Project Uplift, an app to solve the most basic need for a ton of people - better time management and pressure handling.

The app also includes 50 of the most authentic relaxing sounds that will calm anyone down.

This will give them the motivation to keep going and fulfill their personal deadlines on time. What if they get stressed during work? The app will remind them to take a break where they can sit back, relax, and enjoy our custom selected sounds designed for ultimate relaxation.

We realized that the game had a hidden allure - the game play is very simple, barely any, but it worked its way to become one of our favourites of all time. Upon reflection we realized that we loved it because the game maintained Tsuki's independence, that it is not a pet but an independent individual capable of many surprises. Our original idea was to create an app for busy families with a child living away for school. The child would update a virtual character -- like Tsuki -- to reflect their own happenings in life, and their parents would be able to peek in whenever they are free. This would be useful for busy families who would otherwise not have the time to update each other on each of their lives.

The activities people share need to be less sensitive, hence we narrowed it down to  a few categories including studying, gaming, sleeping, out of the house, and secret mode. The significance of this project is that it allows people to join a community of friends, to feel that they are not alone, even while they choose to stay home. Many of our peers tend to stay home for long periods of time, and we have felt for ourselves the sense of isolation that it can bring.

I named it Peripheral because it goes around the filter and folder separation at the center.With peripheral, once I launch my LANdmark, other people will be able to perform high-speed file sharing over the LAN through my machine, with the files deleted from the host after a certain delay or after a specific number of downloads (both specified, whichever occurs earlier). This would certainly lower the security measures by a limited amount, but the host will greatly help other people in the area to perform direct file sharing.As a temporary file hub, all files in Peripheral will be deleted on relaunching the server.Peripheral is currently under beta.

"ASC Protocol","Make smart contracts/blockchains able to execute themselves and automatically do things for a user that is offline","[6205, ""Inspired by GSN, which enables one to pay for another's transactions, we decided to generalize the concept of mutually beneficial transactions further. The impetus behind this is two-fold:  1. Requiring people to either be online or run bots in order to manage their blockchain accounts poses a major barrier to adoption. And 2. Remaining silo'd within our own accounts leaves a tremendous amount of value on the table that we could otherwise all benefit from.  "", ""ASC Protocol  = Active Smart Contract/Active State Change (for Cosmos) Protocol. At a high level, ASC allows you to specify conditions under which transactions can be made on your behalf, and economically incentivizes others to fund these transactions when these conditions are met. This opens up a new paradigm of possibility within blockchains. With it, in a decentralized and 100% trustless way, you can do things like:Run scheduled subscription payments that just workStop monitoring DeFi products for changes in rates. Specify your criteria and leave the rest to the bots.Regain the power to use stop-limit/stop-loss orders. There's no reason these financial instruments should be relegated to the world of centralized exchanges. Cause autonomous DAO payments, either to users such as in the case of insurance or UBI, or to oracles and other necessary public goods. We have implemented/designed this functionality in 3 ways:A1) Used ASC Protocol to add stop loss functionality to the new Cosmos DEX (link for the PR is below).A2) Aside: We have also added 2 PRs to Cosmos that should hopefully resurrect their fallen tutorials (links also below).B) Created a ManagedLendingService ASC for AAVE that removes the pressure from users to keep an eye on lending rates. C) Used ASC Protocol to design stop loss functionality for the Waves DEX## How we built it#A1)We used the Cosmos SDK and golang to create a module that allows an application to use a new stop loss order type. We also created a nice UI to show how a user would get their transaction to a relayer (described below).Transaction flow:The user finds a relayer, ideally through a web-market of relayers that have each publicly stated they are willing to hold onto transactions for competing fee rates, such as a stop loss, and watch the relevant price data until they are able to fulfill the condition of the tradeThe user signs a Stop transaction but does not broadcast it to the wider networkThe user privately sends the signed transaction in raw hex format to the chosen relayer through their chosen channel, who then stores the tx locallyThe relayer watches the relevant priceWhen the market price goes above or below the stop price (depending on initPrice), the transaction is able to be executed, so the relayer broadcasts the tx to the wider networkThe tx is executed successfully. The user has bought or sold around their desired price. Cancer is cured. There is peace in the Middle East. World hunger is no more.#B)We created solidity smart contracts that wrap the AAVE money markets to provide a ManagedLendingService. One of the problems with money markets is that they contain technical, economic, and security risk. People are interested in the high yields offered by stablecoins, but don't want to spend their days monitoring the markets for changes. The ManagedLendingService allows you to specify conditions under which your token balance can be deposited or withdrawn from the AAVE money markets, and provides an economic incentive to relayers who cause these state transitions to occur. This results in a specialization of labor that is to the benefit of everyone. More technical users are happy to build bots to watch the blockchain for profit, while more lay users benefit from the ease of use and profit margins that come from automation, causing gains in efficiency and creating value that would otherwise be lost. In addition to the deployed smart contracts, we created a nice UI that we modeled after the current AAVE UI, but with extra fields for specifying the risk tolerance of the user. We then hooked up that UI to the Kovan Ethereum testnet and integrated with MetaMask and the deployed smart contracts. It's an actual working product, end-to-end!#C)We applied the ASC Protocol to Waves to design a stop loss mechanism for their DEX, similar to Cosmos above. More advanced functionalities can also be discussed.## Challenges we ran intoUsing the web3.js library to hook up MetaMask was a challenge as it was highly finnicky. Bad practices abound on stack overflow for web3.js, such as inlining private keys in code and re-inventing the wheel for signing. Understanding Cosmos well enough to start writing code and know how it would fit into the overall architecture of a real application such as the Cosmos DEX was difficult. The tutorials for doing so had many bugs which made it take much longer than it should've, which is why we decided to submit a PR (which has been already merged!) to help others in the future. ## Accomplishments that we're proud ofMainly extending a promising protocol that unlocks functionality within the blockchain space and reduces friction, but also:Understanding Cosmos...kind of....lolBecoming an official Cosmos contributor by getting a PR mergedGetting MetaMask to successfully workCreating a really clean git repo for a hackathon :)## What we learnedThe architecture of Cosmos, how to build modules, and how those modules fit togetherMore detailed Web3.jsHow AAVE works internally## What's next for ASC ProtocolDepends if we have the funds to continue ;)Built WithgolangjavascriptreactsolidityTry it outgithub.comgithub.comgithub.comgithub.com      Submitted to    DeFi HackathonWinner                Money Legos with AAVE - AAVE                  Created by  I developed the front end and helped integrating it with the smart contracts.Hans Paul PizzininiI developed the AAVE ManagedLoanService smart contracts we deployed, and wrote the web backend in web3js to interface with them.

"MLTonin","A productivity app to keep track of, evaluate and improve sleep cycles for those with sleep-deprivation","[5028, ' ', ' ', 'We built MLTonin in two main parts, the web interface and the background machine learning processes. The machine learning is done through an ensemble network, composed of a  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We first use a CNN as well as OpenCV to detect a user\'s facial contours and produce a predicted value for drowsiness at any given point in a session. We then pipe that information into a RNN to extrapolate user behavior for more complex analysis on patterns overtime. The data is normalized using the Wolfram api. These values are weighted and compounded into one value that describes the user\'s current energy level (from 0-10). That energy level value is sent to our firebase realtime database (which communicates this data with out front-end UI), as well as a windows-api (which automatically adjusts screen-brightness of the user\'s workspace).The web interface also has an additional CNN, built using tensorflow.js and face-api.js. This model provides expression analysis, which is used for outlier detection in comparison to the other firebase values. The web interface displays an ""Aggregated Sleep Metric"" (ASM), which is calculated by weighing the various inputs (the energy level obtained from firebase and expression analysis values from tensorflow.js) and running them through a consensus algorithm. The consensus algorithm checks relative differences and returns the most appropriate energy value with the given inputs. ', 'One of the most major difficulties we encountered is that our models was over-fitting due to the limited size of our datasets. We solved this by using different metrics (e.g., image pixel data, image contour patterns .etc) and therefore diversifying our training data.Another challenge that we ran into was getting the windows-api working. We encountered bugs interfacing the high-level python scripts with the low-level system apis.

"Emotional-Password-Protection","Real-time emotion recognition for password creation","[3952, ""We wanted to look at using machine learning for data security but couldn't pinpoint a specific area/project we wanted to attempt due to time constraints. We were cautious that we might not have enough time to design, implement, and train a classifier in 24 hours, meaning we wouldn't be able to complete the project. We thought about using facial detection as some sort of safeguard for data. We then found a pre-trained facial emotion classifier here. This model and classifier were freely available through the MIT license. We decided to look at using these detected emotions to create a unique password to protect important files. This password is unique to the emotions shown, the number of emotions, and even the duration specified for each emotion.What we learned:Through this project we learned to be patient and not give up on an idea if it seems hard at first. Initially we were dismissing a lot of projects due to their complexity. We learned that planning is vital to a project like this with a very limited time frame. Coding isn't the biggest problem in a project like this since we can look up documentation easily. The hardest part is finding a project that we can complete in 24 hours, and enjoy doing. We also learned how to allocate work appropriately and consider how difficult each task was. We had to communicate a lot during the project to keep each other updated on progress of different modules. We also did a lot of pair programming for some of the harder parts of the project, as a second pair of eyes allows us to spot errors and issues more easily.How we built it:We based the foundation of the projection on a pre-trained model and classifier found here. We used the classifier itself to detect the emotion of the user a lot better than we may have been able to do on our own. We decided to use this model because creating the model and classifier from scratch would have been incredibly challenging. We used the model to average the users emotions over a period of time, for the specified number of emotions. These averaged emotions were then double hashed using SHA-2 256 bit hashing.

We also did a lot of pair programming for some of the harder parts of the project, as a second pair of eyes allows us to spot errors and issues more easily.How we built it:We based the foundation of the projection on a pre-trained model and classifier found here. We used the classifier itself to detect the emotion of the user a lot better than we may have been able to do on our own. We decided to use this model because creating the model and classifier from scratch would have been incredibly challenging. We used the model to average the users emotions over a period of time, for the specified number of emotions. These averaged emotions were then double hashed using SHA-2 256 bit hashing. This generates a secure password for the user.Challenges:The biggest challenge we faced was to understand the forked work since neither of us were experienced with image classification to that level, especially since only learned a small part of classification for text. The emotional recognition was an entire level of challenge on top of the facial recognition. Finding a pre-trained model was also incredibly difficult. We chose to use a pre-trained model due to the fact we were inexperienced with creating an emotional recognition classifier and would not have been able to design, implement, and train our own system. We tweaked this existing system under the MIT license in order to create a functional proof of concept system.We also faced a huge challenge in beginning this project. Initially we could not decide on a project and switched between several before finally settling on this particular project at hour 6 of the hack.Acknowledgements and Other InformationThis work is inspired by this project, which was  inspired from this work and the resources of Adrian Rosebrock. Expaning the inspired project to average the emotions over a period of time and output a specified number of averages, as well as the hashing, input parameters for number of emotions and averaging duration, and turning emotions into a password was a joint effort between Luke Peacock and Syed Hafizur Reza for the Hack Sheffield 5 eventFor more information, please visit the github repo hereBuilt Withcv2keraspythontensorflowTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    hackSheffield 5    Created by  Luke PeacockSyed Hafizur Reza "", ' ']","['python', 'tensorflow', 'keras', 'cv2']","False","0","['luke_peacock', 'sreza1']","","False","0"

First piece of software allows the Wii to act as an oscilloscope reading the voltage values of the main joystick. This is used to  help identify potentiometer drift, which is when the potentiometer no longer reads accurately and the controller moves on it's own in a game. It can also be used for identifying Snapback, which is when you quickly flick a joystick and on its way back it moved to the other size and can cause an input in the opposite direction. If you were to hook up some kind of low voltage low frequency signal you could use it as a oscilloscope for other electronics, not sure why you would want to but the option is there. The next piece of software has the user flick the joystick and calculates what value of capacitor you need to remove snapback. the Snapback is essentially a short voltage spike, and using a correctly valued capacitor can bring this below the deadzone of a controller, a deadzone being the area where the values are not read. It calculates a value between .22uf to 1uf, with a good controller being listed and not needing the mod. This takes out the guesswork and expensive equipment needed to find the correct capacitor.the Third piece of software gives a graphical indication of where shield drop values are compared to the controllers values. Shield drop is a technique in smash melee but to do it consistently you need a controller with angles that let you easily hit the float values needed to do it, they few controllers have it so people can file at the plastic to make it for their controllers. This software helps people more accurately file away their controllers without messing up and wasting a controller shell.The last piece of software is a button tester, it tests most of the button inputs and shows that they are all working correctly, not much to say about this one.I also designed a pcb meant to have user adjustable capacitors with dip switches, as well as a reactive led mod to show that the information you get from my program are applicable to the modification or repair of the hardware.

The user is instructed to flick the controller left 10 times and then down 10 times, it finds the worst spike in value and it will check the data i collected as to what capacitor value should resolve the snapback and tells the user to use that value capacitor.The third one was made using sprites and drawRectangle and drawCircle functions included with the library i was using, it has one large sprite representing the gate of the controller, it has two drawCircles and a Rectangle representing the area of values needed to get a shield drop, and a circle showing where the users joystick is currently, you can compare your location to where it has to be for consistent shield drops and indicates which way to file to react that value.

"Hail Yeah!","The main objective of this project is to maximize efficiency in taking preventive measure for mitigating the effects of hail on airplanes on ground and mid-flight.","[6925, 'According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Severe Storms database, there were 4,610 major hail storms in 2018. The depot repair expenses of airliners caused by collisions of foreign matters are up to USD 3-4 billion each year all over the world, leading to flight delay and aviation accidents which further create immeasurable economic losses. Current preventative measures require nearly 10-15 people and approximately 3 hours to deploy covers on the airplane. Humans are exposed to severe weather during these operations. However, in-flight prevention is based around pilot procedure, “When deviating around storms, maneuver on the upwind side so wind is not carrying the storm toward you, and to avoid hail that might spew from the anvil top.” Pilots rely on weather forecast information from air traffic controller (ATC) but hailstorms can not be predicted until last minute with good accuracy. The main motivation behind this study is to maximize efficiency in taking preventive measure to mitigate the effects of hail on airplanes on ground and mid-flight. ', 'This problem is studied in two perspectives, the first case includes the preventive measures for on-ground airplanes and the second case includes risk mitigation for in flight airplanes. The on ground operations require development of infrastructure for building temporary shelters for airplanes during hailstorm. Risk mitigation for mid-air airplanes is achieved by reinforcing the critical structural components by using advanced materials. ', ""We propose a semi-autonomous rover based system which can be deployed to construct a shelter around the plane in advance once the critical weather information is received. Polypropylene material is slippery, moisture resistant and  polypropylene tarps can be used for this application. Our application requires approximately 8100 sq m material based on Boeing-747 dimensions. This material costs  $ 1.20 sq m and the tarp will cost approximately  $9700 for one shelter. The system consists of two sets of rovers on either side of the airplane. The rovers tracks a predefined way-point trajectory. The speed of the rover system is approximately 0.2 m/s, comparable to NASA's Crawler-Transporter which travels at 0.44 m/s in loaded condition. Each rover is equipped with proximity sensors for emergency braking and warning system during operation. This is a semi-autonomous system and the operator can take decisions for deployment and retraction of the system based on the weather. We have created a simulation in SolidWorks to demonstrate the basic functionality of the system and we have developed a hardware prototype of the rover too.  Risk mitigation from hailstorms during flight is proposed to be achieved by using advanced materials which can reinforce the critical components of the aircraft. The primary critical components affected by hail storms are wing leading edges, control surfaces such as ailerons, flaps, slats, elevator and rudder, fuselage nose, engine cowlings and nacelle. Graphene is the strongest material ever tested and it can provide enhanced aerodynamics capabilities. We have created some CAD designs to show this application on actual aircraft components. Graphene based aircraft has already been flight tested on a RC-plane by researchers from University of Central Lancaster in England and the system showed improved flight performance. This material definitely shows better physical and aerodynamic properties as compared to the conventional aircraft materials.  "", 'Identify the problem and define the scope of our proposed solution because we had to address on ground as well as in-flight airplanes. Coming up with a design of the shelter around the plane and operating mechanism due to large and variable dimensions of the planes. Researching a suitable material for creating tarps was also a challenge. We faced challenges in creating the CAD model animations and during preparation of our poster due to some coding issues.  The scope of risk mitigation in-flight was very large and we had to deal with trade-offs in terms of aerodynamic performance and safety of the aircraft. Researching a suitable reinforcement material was also challenging as we had to compare various physical properties wit respect to the conventional aircraft materials.  ', 'We are extremely proud that we developed our idea from a white board sketch to an actual simulation, prototype. We were proud of our combined thinking and effort as a team that we able to narrow down the scope of our project as a result of intensive discussions.

Given this harsh political climate and significant opportunity gap, we wanted to create a project that would fight inequality in higher education. We hope that our application is able to help low-income students find the resources they need to make their college dreams a reality. While looking into existing resources that fulfill that goal, we found some opportunities for top students, but there is almost nothing available for all low-income students that would accomplish the level of resource availability that our app provides. ', ""This app provides a number of accessible resources and steps that students can take in order to prepare themselves for the college admissions process. It provides information about relevant colleges (only around Durham, NC for now, but will expand to many, many more), college admission related events in the area, programs that are specifically tailored towards underprivileged students, advice about the application process, and information about applying for financial aid. Eventually, the app will be able to store individual users' information in order to provide a more friendly user experience. "", ""We built this app using the help of App Lab on Code.org and using its UI Tool Kit as a springboard for our app's development.

We began to think about accessibility and realized that a user interface with inputs completely determined by the user would be a novel system as well as one that is helpful to those who may be unable to interface with tech via traditional means. ', ""In essence, our project utilizes a convolutional neural network in order to decode gestures defined by the user. This allows for an individual to create custom controls to interface with technology of their choosing (We plan to develop various output modules which allow for seamless integration with various services). Our clever network design, data pre-processing, and guided training procedures allow for training to be run on low-end machines (Again, we plan to offload this training onto the cloud in the future). At the moment, we've set up the system not as an interface with any specific software, but as a demonstration of its ability to differentiate gestures. By virtue of that, we hope that its usability as a universal user interface is acknowledged.In our application, the user starts at a simple menu and can choose to define a new set of gestures or test recognition of their existing gestures. *If they choose to define new gestures, they will be asked how many gestures they want as well as what they should be called. The system will then observe their hand motions through a connected camera, training itself to recognize each one.*If the user decides to test their current gestures, they will arrive at a screen that shows them the camera feed as well as an indication of which gesture it has identified their input as. "", 'We built nearly the entire program in Python, using various libraries that were necessary along the way. In order to generate usable data, we built a process that takes raw image data and converts it to a more useful form. This includes automatically cropping, gray-scaling, and resizing the images to lower resolutions. We then designed a convolutional neural-network which is able to classify those processed images. The functionality of the whole system is then tied to the native python GUI that we built for ease of use. ', 'Just as with any development, we encountered a few hurdles along our path. Although we established a clear plan before beginning our work, we often had to change course when our initial ideas were leading us in the wrong direction. Addressing this involved lots of re-working and further planning. Additionally, some of our prototype ideas had difficulty meshing with our final development environment, not to mention the struggle of keeping said environment consistent amongst our team members.The most obvious challenge for our project was of course the time constraints.

It's time to stand up for the underdog.","[3977, 'Our inspiration for this project stemmed from the various ideas on disaster relief.  After taking note on previous hackathon solutions as well as other various natural disaster relief applications, we noticed a common ground: every natural disaster mitigation proposal focused on rescuing the people, but nothing on rescuing the animals.  This is where our research began, and our findings were stunning.  According to California newsletter SF Gate, a small nonprofit called Kincade Fire Pet Rescue Reunification Group has been overseeing the rescue of pets from the recent California wildfires.  In order to make their efforts as efficient as possible, they report spending roughly 18 hours a day combing through numerous social media posts, calling missing pet owners, collecting photos, and more in order to even get an idea of where a missing pet may belong.  Other similar examples include Hurricane Katrina, where nearly 16,000 pets went missing, and only 15% ever made it home.  This is a very preventable problem, and by drawing more attention to the significance of pet loss by creating an innovative solution seemed more than necessary.  ', ""It starts with the owner.  If the owner finds their pet is missing due to a natural disaster or any other reason, they would use PetGet to fill out a description of their pet, an image, as well as their last known location.  After this form is completed, local law enforcement is notified, and a post to PetGet's website is created.  Then, other PetGet users can see the listings of missing pets, sorted by the proximity between the user and the pet's last known location.  If someone believes they have found a missing pet, they can look through the local posts and find the pet(s) that best match the description of the pet they found.  They would then notify the poster about the finding, and say the pet's current location after the pet was found, whether it be a shelter, a house, a veterinary hospital, etc.  The poster would go to this location and claim their pet.  The applications of this concept are especially useful for relief agencies/nonprofits, as they can find pets in distress at a much faster rate and they can locate the pet's owner quickly and easily, allowing for more pets to be saved and more owners to be reunited with their pets.  Even everyday bystanders or pedestrians can find missing pets, allowing for a broad network of people helping the cause of caring for the pets.

Some of the preceding concerns are not within the scope of the airline to address, but the airlines have full responsibility when it comes to recognizing and correcting cleanliness concerns on-flight. Airplanes also serve as an unfortunate but effective means of spreading communicable disease from either passenger to passenger or from departure location to destination. ', ""UV-C light is used to destroy 99.999% of pathogens on tray tables when they are placed in the upright position between flights. UV-C light is also used to destroy 99.999% of pathogens in the on-flight water prior to dispensation before going through a final particulate filter to provide clean water for on-flight services. An app is also available for download where the customer can track information regarding the flight's water and air quality maintenance logs, with additional information pertaining to specific technologies implemented by SanAir on-flight and other general hygiene practices for the customer to consider. "", ""The app was designed using Swift and a model of the UV-C light was created in AutoDesk Fusion360. The 3D CAD model was designed with the intention to be realistic and practical for an airline while retaining the ability to be easily manufactured and readily implemented into new aircraft. A realistic 3D model of an aircraft seat demonstrating the function of the technology was established using both stock and custom parts. The CAD model has a fully animated worm gear system that is driven by a Nema 11 stepper motor. This allows an array of custom, short-beam UV-C LED's to shine over the entire surface of the tray as it is turned into the upright position. The purpose of the array's capacity to rotate is two-fold. It allows for a smaller amount of LED's to be required to reach the entire surface of the tray, and it also hides the surface of the lenses when the tray is in the open position. The latter prevents the passenger from tampering with  or accidentally damaging the UV-C lights during flight. A worm gear was chosen for mechanical advantage in the system. Worm gears provide improved torque and accuracy while being driven, and prevent the array from being rotated by an external force from a passenger. A limit switch was also included in the design that only allows the UV-C LED's to activate if the tray is in the upright position. After assessing the difficulties in maintaining clean water on an aircraft, lack of intervention in the water filtration system was noted to be a choke point in securing potable water on-flight. New filters will be instituted to aid current UV-C technology used by newer aircraft that kill pathogens along the water feed line. There is no current mechanism in place to ensure that the water remains potable after being deposited into the plane's water reserve once it passes through the first phase of UV-C technology in place. A UV-C system will be placed into the water system between storage and access of the water. Older planes without the current UV-C technology can also be retrofitted with the UV-C light at dispensation as well. An additional particulate filter using activated carbon will be added as an additional measure to remove other organic molecules and contaminants that pose health risks to passengers.

We simply looked at the different categories and were inspired by the theme “Best Data Oriented Hack”. After an hour of brainstorming, one of our teammates recommended this concept. The idea of incorporating machine learning in our project without any prior knowledge in the domain seemed interesting enough and challenging enough for us to get the perfect hackathon experience.  ', ""The user draws a digit on the 28 by 28 grid. As the user draws the digit, our app sends snapshots of the drawing to a Machine Learning model designed to identify digits (0-9). The user is able to see the model's confidence level for each digit in real-time, as well as the top prediction at the top of the screen. "", ""Our Number Guesser app is built for iOS using Apple's Swift language. The model we use was originally made in Python and then converted to a model that iOS' CoreML library can use. The drawing interface is made up of several UIViews and detects pan gestures that happen on that collection. Using the methods that are used to color each cell that the user draws on, we send a picture of the user’s drawing after every fifth cell detection. This image is resized to 28 by 28 to fit the model and then the model interprets the image and returns each digit and its confidence value. "", ""We wanted to add the ability to take a picture of a digit with the device's camera, but the model requires that the digit is colored white and placed on a dark background. Our idea was to detect if the picture was mostly light or dark and then invert the colors if the picture was mostly light. Unfortunately, we were unable to find a way to invert the colors of a UIImage effectively.  "", 'After getting the model to return pretty consistent results, the app actually felt like an accomplishment. While we didn’t train the model ourselves, applying the model to the UI we built and seeing a working application come out of it was certainly a satisfying result.  ', 'By doing this project, we developed a basic understanding of how picky ML models can be. Machines can’t interpret anything that they’re not trained to interpret.

"Bio-Inspired Multi-UAV for Wildlife Control on Runways","Developing an autonomous system for a safe and efficient dispersal of animals from runway using multiple UAVs which follow a novel bio-inspired algorithm","[5009, 'Wildlife strikes in airports are increasing year over year. Current precautionary methods involve a lot of human involvement and shooting of wildlife as a safety precautionary method. We felt a need for bringing autonomy to current methods in this field. The fact that the problem was very challenging inspired us more to work on this problem. ', 'We developed an algorithm for using Multiple UAVs for surveillance of the area and animal dispersal on and near airport runways. Higher-level control of decentralized multiple UAVs will cover the entire airport area by dividing the area into segments. During surveillance, if there is any animal movement, the UAVs detect that by using computer vision techniques. This information is sent into the network. Three of UAVs nearest to the animal collaborate and form a pattern such that they scares away animals and makes them disperse in the direction away from the runway and towards a specific trap. This logic is developed from wolves hunting patterns.  ', 'We divided the whole problem into two sub-problems. Detection of animals and Deterrence of animals post detection. Detection: The area of inspection needs to be covered periodically during the patrolling. Therefore, the entire area is divided into segments and we followed the sweep algorithm for area coverage in which one UAV monitors each segment. The algorithm is designed such that each point is inspected once in time, T. During its surveillance operation, if a UAV camera detects any animal movement it tags it and follows it. Deterrence: The second part of the problem is dispersing animals away from the runway. One method that is prevailing currently is shooting the animals that get on runways but this will not preserve wildlife. Therefore, in addressing this problem, we came up with a novel technique which is inspired by wolves hunting pattern. Cristina Muro in his paper on ""Wolf-pack (Canis lupus) hunting strategies emerge from simple rules in computational simulations"" mentioned how wolves form a pattern surrounding their prey animals for chasing them down. However, our technique is designed to disperse them away from the runway. UAVs form a shape around animals within a safe distance in such a manner that animals will have only one direction to escape.  These UAVs use high-frequency sounds or flashlights to disperse animals away from the runway. We simulated this behavior using MATLAB in which results are satisfying. ', 'Initially, the problem we choose looked simple, but when we went into details we came across many problems. The main challenge is finding logic for dispersing animals without having the need to shot them. Later, while coding the developed algorithm.

', 'An increased number of passengers especially during the peak time period is a serious problem for airports because not all airports are designed to serve passengers beyond the threshold point which causes congestion and the number is expected to be on the rise over the coming years. Our goal is to explore ways to improve Customer Experience (CX) but still be profitable for both the airport and the airlines. Our focus areas are to enhance the travel experience from the moment the passenger booked his/her flight. This can be achieved by monitoring human behavior and communicating it in the right way to reduce congestion by using Machine Learning techniques. ', 'Better communication, accommodation, and compassion will greatly improve the Customer Experience. We aim to achieve this by equipping the airline company with a fleet of semi-autonomous vehicles that have the capability to scan the baggage and weigh it while kept in the boot of the car. This way, the passenger is alerted about the presence of banned stuff like more than 100ml of liquid, sharp objects which otherwise have to be thrown away by the TSA while screening. This might be heartbreaking when passengers have to throw away valuables when unknowingly packed into the luggage. With these semi-autonomous vehicles, the presence of these substances can give the passenger an option to return it to their pickup location.A multi-vehicle path planning algorithm schedules the order of pickup for multiple customers A MATLAB algorithm is used to schedule the pickup time for each passenger so that not all the passengers arrive at the same time to the airport This is achievable by a fee that a user can pay to arrive at a time closer to their flight departure time to avoid waiting at the airport for about 3 hours The airline personnel then sends a text to the passenger and the pickup time by the airline owned vehicle The passenger then loads their baggage into the trunk. Now, the passenger has the option to either check-in their baggage by themselves which has no fee or to opt for the enhanced passenger experience by paying a fee which speeds up their wait time at the airport cause the check-in would be done by the airline personnel as the weigh-in and baggage screening is done at the car itself Another solution to reduce congestion that we have implemented is by using a neural network to train the algorithm using a data set that has the data for ~20 hours of passenger entry and exit for every time period throughout the day. Once the algorithm is trained, it can predict the number of passengers at each time step for the next day. Using this we can bring in the passengers at the time when there is less congestion  ', 'Incorporating feasible, near-future techniques as a model for our futuristic airportMentors steered us in the right path to focus more on decreasing the congestion for passengers during peak hours of operationFew setbacks while coding  ', 'Machine Learning algorithm works pretty well in predicting the passenger traffic the next day using the given data setModeling the enhancement of Passenger Experience by reducing wait time at the airport using tech equipped vehicles for picking up passengersDeveloped a GUI for an app-based booking system ', 'There is plenty of room for development and enhancement of passenger experience Immediate need to reduce congestion as the number of passengers traveling at peak hours is constantly on the riseRevenue model: Price/miles just like Uber if one wants to be exactly on time the price is 2 times the normal price If a passenger is willing to spend time at the airport it is the normal revenue Carpooling option can be added for 0.5 times the normal price Advertising revenue can be generated through AR app or AR glasses which shall be used for navigating within the airport or to access in-flight entertainment or to customize food offered on the flight  ', 'Market opportunity:IATA expects 7.2 billion passengers to travel by 2035 Let’s assume our sample size is 0.1% of the total (7.2 million per annum) The intended initial market is individuals in the age of 18-50 in the United States who travel for leisure or business which is 1 billion as of 2018Based on half-a-dollar profit on each passenger, the estimated profit comes out to $7.8 million/annumValue proposition (Total available market):  Kate: A millennial who earns more than $100k, loves to travel and worries about the time and traffic to get to the airport.

"Flock","Hurricane Dorian took over sixty lives in the first two weeks. Our project will help these people when they need it the most and no one else can by quickly restoring communications following disasters","[4740, ""When doing research for already implemented solutions to solve communication restoration challenges for disaster sites we came across Google's solution, Project Loon, which restores LTE to large areas using weather balloons and satellite communications; however, it comes with a two week delay in response time. After further research, we realized that the first two weeks are the critical response window where matters are life and death for victims of the disaster. For example, during Hurricane Dorian over 60 people passed away in the first two weeks. It was incredibly apparent a tool for first responders needed to be created to aid people in need immediately after a disaster. "", ""Our solution will serve as the bridge between the disaster and when Project Loom can be deployed by providing a communication solution for the disaster site with at most a latency of 1 hour from flock deployment to when first responders get notified. This enables first responders to know exactly where the victims are, as well as, providing a message describing their current condition and how to get to them allowing responders to provide the critical life saving aid the victim's need. Furthermore, this solution will forward any text message out of the effected areas that a victim would want to send. "", ""We built this by creating a cross platform mobile app that anyone with WiFi can utilize. A victim can queue messages to be sent in this app stating whether or not the message is an emergency notification to responders or just a normal text message. When the first responders arrive on scene they select the effected area on a map and deploy a flock of completely autonomous drones that fly in a grid like pattern to collect these messages from the victims. Next, when a communication drone flies over the affected area the queued messages are automatically transmitted to the drone via it's wireless access point and stored on the drone's internal cache. Once the drones finish their patrol they fly back to the first responder who loads the messages onto their computer using our custom made application where messages are parsed dropping pings onto a map so first responders know the state of the victim and their precise location, and forwards the text messages to the given phone number via a satellite internet connection on the first responders computer.

"D.O.O.M.B.A.","An open source flexible robot arm for the development and implementation on various platforms. From robots that spread butter to minimally invasive surgical devices, the D.O.O.M.B.A. has many uses!","[5003, 'Today, most robot arms operate with several rigid linkages and servos moving them. What if they were not limited by these inflexible linkages and could move more similarly to a tentacle? They could be used for a number of novel applications, from fishing clogs out of drains to saving lives by assisting surgeons in minimally invasive surgery. The idea behind the D.O.O.M.B.A. is to develop an extremely flexible open source robot arm that can eventually become applicable in these situations. ', 'D.O.O.M.B.A. uses three servo motors with strings attached to pull a central spring to the desired position. Commands are sent from a computer to the system to control the speed and position of the arm. ', 'To start, the electrical system was assembled and the motors were tested. A laptop power supply was purchased to provide power to the motors and modified such that it could connect to the Arduino CNC shield. Wood for the frame was marked, cut, drilled and assembled. Next, the electronics were attached to the frame, spools were cut from a dowel rod, and affixed them to the servos. Nylon washers were drilled such that the string would pass through them and that they would fit tightly on the spring. Finally these washers were put onto the spring, string was run through them, and the spring was set in place. ', 'We ran into many challenges making this robot arm, but the main ones involved some interesting design limitations and hardware problems. The first of which was the need for a spool for the string, which was something we overlooked. We fixed this by building spools from scratch using a wooden dowel. Furthermore, we ran into some programming errors which were especially hard to debug because the software had almost no error information other than an error existed. To solve this, we went through the start up operation and checked the settings, making sure each bit was the value we needed and did some internet digging to make sure we had the right values to achieve our goal. Another problem was that we had no power supply that would fit our CNC shield. We solved this issue by buying a computer power supply and using a paperclip as the new prongs to connect the supply to the shield. We added heat shrink to give some insulation and keep the paperclip from touching itself, which when tested worked perfectly. The last big problem we had was not being able to hold the servos in a single position so that we could get the arm to hold its position. To solve this we had to set a specific field to all 1’s, which allowed the servos to be constantly fed power so that they could hold their position. ', 'At the end of this, we are happy to say we have achieved our goal of creating a truly flexible robot arm from open-source parts. It may not be quite ready for surgery, but it is a significant step in the right direction! The interface is intuitive, all parts are easily replaceable, and the arm works as intended which is wonderful. ', 'Over the weekend we learned about and improved our skills in a variety of areas including arduino, circuits, gcode, and the physical side of building the frame, arm, and joints. The kit we used was an arduino cnc kit, which used gcode an all new language that allows the programmer to give instructions to the three servos to go in three directions, X, Y, and Z. In order to work with the hardware we needed to learn more and brush up on our embedded systems skills when we had to deal with setting flags for certain pieces of functionality we wanted. Some group members also got some new experience working with hardware and circuits for the first time by helping wire everything up. ', 'The next steps for D.O.O.M.B.A. would be adding in a more natural way of controlling it our initial ideas were with potentiometers or a joystick. We would also need a better cooling system so we can go for longer periods of time before we have to cool off the board, and a more improved hardware control scheme to give more range of motion/precision to the arm.

Back-end: We used a pre-trained natural language processing model to give subjectiveness evaluation to the news articles.

We used a breadth-first-search based web crawler to obtain news articles radiating from a webpage (for example, New York Times, shown in the NLP section below). We focused on analyzing and displaying the distribution of articles published by the same press to our customers.(See presentation slide for detailed NLP model description, page 7-9.)JustificationWhy can we use a model trained on movie reviews on news?Initial thoughts: Both movies and news models are subjectiveness evaluations based on sentences. The language unit is small, and the theme difference will not serve as a determining factor.Model analysis: As we look into the histogram plots of both the movie review model and news article model, we can see that the distributions are similar.

Later, some of his friends wished to implement their own, but the setup process was lengthy and frustrating when new bugs were discovered.

With this, we decided to use data from yelp.com which had tons of restaurant and review data for us to work on. Another challenge was the fact that all of us were not familiar with collaborative filtering (one reason why we wanted to involve Machine Learning in our project was to learn more about it!).

"Liqui3D (Game of DEXes)","FOMO3D x Liquidity Mining","[5169, 'Inspired by the ""War of Attrition"" game behind FOMO3D, we built Liqui3D to allow for the bottom-up emergence of liquidity, particularly among less popular cryptoasset pairs that fall in the long-tail of all traded cryptoasset pairs on a DEX.ProtocolGame startMultiple players place trades of a given trading pair (like ETH-BTC, DOGE-ETH). The transaction fees - typically a percentage of the traded amount - associated with their trades are collected in the pot. In the beginning, the POT contains the sum of all transaction fees from all players who have placed trades of this specific trading pair. Depending on how big is your order and how liquid this trading pair is, there will be some transaction fees.The transaction fees is directly proportional to the amount being tradedThe transaction fees is inversely proportional to the liquidity of the trading pair. For example, the initial transaction fee is 1%, if only 10 trades happened in the last 5 mins, we are going to increase the transaction fee, because traders would be willing to pay a little more to make the trade happen faster.If the trading pair is very popular, like ETH/BTC, the transaction fee will be very low, because there is no need to increase liquidity at this point. The POT smart contract details the amount of transaction fees that belongs to each player. A portion of the Amount in POT continuously remains in the POT, and the remaining portion of it is given as a contribution to the global lottery pool. Game TimerThe countdown will start after a certain pot size. The init countdown is 1 minute. When any trade happens, the countdown timer will accumulate a little more time. The max countdown time is 1 hour. If there is no trade happen when the countdown comes to 0, this round ends.24 hour periodic redistribution: Local weighted lotteryThe trading transaction fees collected from all players is pooled into the local_lottery_pool. 10% of the cumulative amount from the pot gets assigned as the lottery_prize. Every 24 hours, one player out of all the existing players is randomly chosen. The chosen player wins the lottery_prize. The likelihood of winning is proportional to the player’s relative contributions to the pot. i.e. the amount of transaction fees they contributed to the pot cumulatively.P(Player1 wins) = (Player1\'s total contributions to the POT) / (Total amount in POT)Justification for local lottery vs. global lotteryA global lottery would motivate players to create new esoteric shitcoins, just so they would have a greater likelihood of winning the global lottery. By protocol, esoteric shitcoin pairs would be assigned higher transaction fees, thus building a larger pot relative to the amount being traded. A larger pot would mean the probability of winning the global lottery is higher too. Thus, global lotteries indirectly encourage the creation of new esoteric shitcoins.Justification for allocating portion of cumulative amount in POT vs. portion of trades placed in the last 24 hoursIntroducing such temporal nuances may give room for the development of attack vectors related to time of order placement. One such scenario would be when multiple players agree via an external side contract to all place their orders on the same day, such that they pump up the local_lottery_pool for the upcoming lottery. A player would agree to such a contract with the incentive being saving on opportunity cost, or effort (i.e. akin to laziness, you’d rather place a high volume of trades on the same day and take the next day off). This would drive game dynamics to entertain short spans of high trading volumes, which is undesirable as we want continuous and consistently high volumes of liquidity through time. End of gameWhen round ends, the last person who made the trade will take 50% of the pot, the 25% of the pot money goes back to the participants, the last 25% goes to the next round.If the game just goes on forever, at some point, we will distribute some of the pot money back to the participants.Next StepsValidate protocol design decisions via a multi-agent simulationBuilt WithcosmosgoreacttypescriptTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    DeFi HackathonWinner                Tendermint Cosmos Challenge              Winner                Best Project - Grand Prize                  Created by  I had a dream on Friday night and came up with this idea of Liqui3D...

"Leaf","Inspiring change through better eating habits","[6031, 'One member of the team has a friend that recently started eating vegan.  Due to this, he, as well as the rest of the team, was exposed to the vast amount of greenhouse gas emission caused by the current food industry, with emphasis on the meat industry.  Seeing an opportunity to be able to help protect the Earth from greenhouse gas pollution, the team cam up with the idea of Leaf. ', 'The objective of Leaf is to promote and assist users in eating in a way that is both healthier for them and the planet. A user can enter a recipe into the app and the app will then evaluate the environmental impact of the recipe. Impact on the environment is calculated by comparing the quantity of the ingredient called for in the recipe and comparing it to the average greenhouse gas emission for processing and packaging that ingredient. The value of greenhouse emissions used to generate that amount of ingredient in the recipe is then returned to the user. This process is completed for each ingredient in the recipe and then the sum of the greenhouse gas generated by the recipe is shown to the user. Once the user is notified of the impact that their recipe has, possible substitutions can be shown for the recipe that would decrease its carbon footprint. Overall, Leaf will allow for people to make healthier food lifestyle choices by helping ease users into a more sustainable, vegetarian inspired diet. Additionally, with these lifestyle changes comes a lessened carbon footprint by finding foods that are less damaging to the environment during their production. ', 'Initial data compiling and organization was done with Python. This included using a basic web crawler to acquire pricing, food, and environmental impact data.  Additionally, this data was then converted into usable .json files to be used in the final project. Once this was completed, the back-end and front-end were constructed. To manage the dataset we compiled, we utilized a local MySQL relational database to store the information in a handful of tables. From there we set up a Spring server using Maven to create an API to access and manipulate the data from the database. Functionalities include user management and querying the database of green house gas emission records for common food options. The client side application was written for Android and features a clean, tabbed GUI. Each tab corresponds to a major function of the application. These include the home, where carbon emission statistics about the user can be observed, the ingredient replacement tab, where ingredients can be swapped out for cleaner alternatives, the recipes section, where a carbon emission score is calculated using calls to the back-end to process the food in question and finally the profile, where user settings can be found. The application features the full-stack and takes advantage of remote processing for determining clean food alternatives as well as storing user data. ', 'One of the biggest challenges we faced was when we went to connect the front-end and back-end of our app. A majority of this was due to various issues while making volley requests. One issue was syntax mismatches between the front-end and back-end which were difficult to locate, causing errors to arise when running our code. An example of this was that each end had the correct objects and attributes in the request, there were slight nomenclature issues that resulted in failure of our volley requests despite it being a subtle issue. ', 'We are most proud of the fact that we were able to complete a full stack project in only 36 hours. Our team has also learned many new skills over the course of this competition; this is another accomplishment that we are proud of. ', ""All of the team members were able to learn a new skill at this year's competition.  Matt learned how to create a web crawler that is able to take prices, names, and image URLs off of an online shopping website. In addition, he learned the basics of app development by assisting and watching team members. Sam learned how to set up both a MySQL server for a database and a Spring Boot server from scratch to create the back-end.  Jeff learned a lot about how to utilize volley and get requests to create communication between the front-end and back-end as well as the nuances of Android Studio. "", 'Once the 36 hour project version of Leaf concludes, a plethora of possible expansions are available. The ability to track how much greenhouse gas meals produce every week will be implemented and the user will also be able to set goals for emissions each week. In addition, a taste profile can be implemented which will allow for the user to indicate whether they prefer alternate meat, vegetarian, or vegan substitutions to be made into their recipes. This preference feature can also be used in order to accommodate food allergies and make recipe suggestions regarding them. Expanding beyond dietary choices and restrictions, users may choose a few favorite ingredients and have Eco-friendly recipes given to them including the ingredient(s) as a daily recipe suggestion. A final feature that the team will implement is sourcing substitutions for recipes. Once substitutions are displayed to the user, the suggestions may be clicked on to show more information.  This information includes what stores within a set radius sell this product and their prices.

"IDetector","Use the easy, friendly and free eye tracker to create friendly user interface using just your eyes gestures ","[3702, ""With the ever rising number of computer users, the accessibility of computers is still, to a great extent, limited to the use of traditional keyboard inputs. So, using computers for people with disabilities is either quite expensive or an unpleasant experience. We wanted to build an application that could use gestures to perform tasks without using any expensive additional tools.What It DoesThe application user your eyes gesture(more particularly your blink gesture) to perform a task in the computer. In this particular case, we will use our simple flappy bird style game called TonyHops to show the use of such a feature. A user can control the motion of the character just by blinking their eyes and thus would be great for people who are unable to use their arms. Besides, our game, the IDetector also works great with the T-Rex game from google.    How I Built itOur application uses pythons openCV library to take live feed from the users’ webcam. Then we implement the dlib library to track their facial structure. We then use a shape predictor file provided by dlib that can be used with the predictor functions in dlib library to accurately track the users eyes. Then measuring the width to height ratio of the eyes, our program makes an accurate prediction of, if the user blinked his eye. On detecting a blink, the program performs a key press(in our case the space button) which allows you to perform a certain task. The key press can be modified depending on the need of the user.Challenges I ran intoI think the biggest challenge for us was trying to run multiprocessing in python. Since playing the game requires information from the webcam feed and running the game at the same time we needed to implement multiprocessing in our program. However, we ran into a lot of errors while trying to do this. This error definitely cost our team a lot of valuable time.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofThis was the first Hackathon for our team. We had little knowledge on what we would build before we got here. During the first night, our ideas were all over the place and we feared we would not even complete the challenge. But all three of us were very dedicated to make it work. Thus, we brainstormed, out everything on it and seeing the product now is truly satisfying.What I learnedThis project was heavily dependent on the Python openCV library and the dlib library. We got to learn a lot about these powerful tools that Python Offers for image manipulation, detection and much more . We also got into simple game development with python which was a fun experience for everybody. Using Tkinter library to make GUI for python was also a new experience for us.What next for IDectetorIDetector is capable of so much more with just some timy modifications. The dlib library can be used to detect left eye, right eye, nose, and mouth independently. Thus, different gestures from different parts of the face can be used to give even more functionality to the program. With proper implementation, we will be able to make an efficient interface for handicapped people to easily navigate any function in the computer.

"I Desire Apple Pie","Constellations, Space, VR, and Neural Networks, Oh my!","[4947, 'Since the beginning of time, mankind has looked to the stars for inspiration, often leading to some of the greatest scientific and mathematical discoveries to date. Kepler, Newton, Laplace, Lagrange, and Einstein are all commonplace names in every classroom, but many would be surprised to know that their motivation for making some of the greatest advances in science and technology were born out of a desire to understand our universe and the laws that govern it. Soon, mankind will begin the efforts of colonizing other planets, and the thirst for discovery will be quenched once again. This project was born out of curiosity for what life will be like once humanity makes that step. What will we see when we look up from other planets? We wanted a way to visualize 3D space and explore the stars and constellations in a way they had not been seen before. This, coupled with the VandyHacks theme to create a work of art, led us to build the first Martian art Gallery. As Carl Sagan once said: “If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe”. ', 'A Virtual Reality experience that transports the user to an art exhibition on the Martian surface. Exhibits range from sculpture, to monuments, to 3D constellation models. The sky is made with real-time star mapping that represents what the actual night sky will look like when future Martians look to the stars. The size and brightness of each star directly correlates with the distance the star is from our Solar System and its Flux value. The simulation features narration by a neural network version of Carl Sagan, who teaches the user about a variety of concepts that will be crucial to the future of humanity living outside of the Earth system, as well as offbeat facts about some of the celestial bodies that make up many of the worlds favorite constellations. ', 'The Virtual Reality simulation was built using Unreal Engine and Oculus hardware, as well as real-time voice synthesis with small data sets, image hyper resolution neural network trained primarily on 2D data sets used to enhance textures provided by NASA and Poliigon, and style transfer with neutral network to make neat art.The star mapping was created by utilizing SPICE Kernels, ephemeris data which determines the precise location of celestial bodies in space depending on a user-defined epoch and reference frame; and Python programming. Python packages used include Spiceypy, Skyfield, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Bpy to interface the code with Blender. SPICE Kernels used include de430, naif0008, and the Hipparcos star catalog, among many others. ', 'Simultaneously running out of VRAM, RAM, GPU, and CPU power; and two complete computer crashes which resulted in file corruption. Additionally, migrating assets from Blender to Unreal Engine and finding ways to interface between all the different project segments proved to be much more difficult than previously anticipated.On the celestial mechanics side, determining the necessary SPICE Kernels required to view bodies from the Mars Barycenter, proper coordinate transformations to convert from the spherical coordinates used in the celestial models to the cartesian coordinates used by Blender and Unreal Engine was tricky to properly align, and determining how to automate the process of building spheres within Blender that correctly correspond to the size and location of stars making up various constellations. ', 'The overall aesthetic of the simulation came out great. We started the weekend off with a much smaller vision and are proud of how we allowed that vision to evolve and transform into a much more cohesive piece or art. There were quite steep learning curves associated with many of the tools we utilized but we were able to overcome them and bring all of the pieces together successfully.

"Hotpot","A positive-sum smart-contract that gamifies saving ","[3584, 'Inspired by a common Chinese rotational lending game called “和会“, meaning “Rotating Credit and Savings Association (ROSCA)"" (these can also be called a \'susu\' or \'tanda\') , which is made of a group of close friends or family members. They pool their money into a common fund, generally structured around monthly contributions, and a single member withdraws the money from it as a lump sum at the beginning of each cycle. The game is heavily reliant on the trust and relationship among members because there is no central authority recording or implementing the transactions. We were also aware that many studies have shown that people are more likely to save if savings are presented in a lottery style. For example, it may be hard for someone to put aside $100 to save, but they are willing to spend that for a 1 in 6 chance at $600 which is analogous to joining a 1 month long, $100 susu (where they would be expected to win $600 twice a year).We also realized that we also had the opportunity to make this a positive-sum game by investing the pot while it is waiting to be paid out. After running some Monte Carlo simulations, we found that the average user will get paid out more than they put in, especially if they join many Susu\'s.Therefore, we decided to put this game on blockchain using a slightly modified version. Instead of one single member withdrawing the sum, we put the sum in the compound interest pool for a certain amount of time and then distribute the larger sum to a few players who win a lottery.

We wanted to build a system that is not only convenient for people like us to easily and quickly make and share presentation, but also build a system that allows those in underprivileged communities that cannot afford laptops or iPads to utilize their smartphones to easily access information shared by their teacher.  ', 'Our system consists of four distinct components. The website is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and gives admin users the option to create or host a presentation. To host a presentation, they connect their Google Drive account and import their presentation, where each slide is converted to a PNG file and sent to a centralized Firebase Database. The iOS app is written in Swift, Objective-C and Ruby and allows client side users to access shared presentations. They are presented with an enter code page, where they can either scan an RFID tag or input a unique authentication key. Once they are verified, they are presented with a live PNG image of the presentation pulled from the Firebase Database that updates immediately after an admin update. Another core functionality of the website is the create presentation, which uses webkit Speech-to-Text libraries and natural language processing to build a brand new presentation for you. Based on recognized speech patterns, you can add text bullets, add graphs, add images, remove bullets, import online information, etc. Lastly, a C++ based Arduino program allows client side iOS app users to easily enter presentation. By utilizing an RFID reader and HM-10 Bluetooth chip, RFID tags can be scanned and sent to the iPhone, where it is mapped to the authentication key. A user is presented feedback from a LCD, an LED, and a buzzer. ', ""We built the iOS app using Swift, Objective-C and Ruby on the XCode IDE. The app was built to support bluetooth connection to the Arduino hardware and WiFi connection to the central Firebase Database. Both base64 encoded and URL images were displayed by the app to the user. The website for creating and hosting presentations was built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. When a user created a presentation, BCrypt encryption standards were used to ensure maximum security in logins and data transfers. Flickr API, webkit Speech-to-Text and CanvasJS were used to provide basic presentation functionality. The hardware was coded in C++ on Arduino IDE. An Arduino Mega 2560, MFRC522 RFID Reader, HM-10 Bluetooth chip, 16x2 LCD, RGB LED, and buzzer were utilized for functionality. The Firebase Database served as the central cloud structure and integrated each component of our system with one another. The database stored each presentations' current slide URL as a PNG image, thus allowing users to view the current slide without a live stream, reducing bandwidth usage. By ensuring that each component was connected in a secure IoT system, we are able to provide a seamless and multi-platform system for users and admins to utilize. "", 'Our major issue was passing images to the Firebase Database during presentation creation. We had no problem converting premade Google Slides presentations into PNG images, but because our presentation creation interface was written straight in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, we were not able to effectively capture all elements (header, text, images, graphs) into a single images. To work around this, we saved two images and overlapped them to create the original. The base image contained the text in the slide and was base64 encoded and the secondary image contained the image in URL form. While this made our app slightly inefficient, this allowed users to view all aspects of the presentation while still reducing bandwidth usage. ', 'We are most proud of our presentation creation console. While our entire system integrates well and accomplishes our original vision, we are extremely proud that our speech recognition and analysis allows accurate and on-the-fly presentation creation excited to test our program in our school presentations! ', 'Although coming in as semi-experienced programmers, we knew almost nothing about speech recognition and natural language processing. Dedicated to integrate this into our project all of our group members worked together to built the final script. Along the way, we learned many techniques to transcribe speech and search for key words that are used in the presentation creation experience.  ', 'We hope to improve on the efficiency of our app. Although it is heavily reliant on WiFi speeds, there are still ways that we can make our admin and client side interfaces function faster. Furthermore, while we were able to figure out image passage while creating presentations, there was no way for us to export the graphs as images. Because the graphs were plotted in HTML and were therefore not images, we tried to build a script to save screenshots of the webpage but ultimately failed. We hope to find a cleaner and faster way to send information from the admin presentation creation to client side viewers.

Our idea is to create a common platform where all requests and volunteer assignments can be managed seamlessly with a workflow pipeline.

Each ticket has a field for the category which can be Disaster Management, Family Services, Volunteer Events. This request is then uploaded as a unique ticket on Trello. Each ticket flows through 4 stages: Backlog, Awaiting Approval, In Progress, Completed. A new ticket stays in the Backlog stage unless it is assigned to the volunteer. If it's a 'Family Services' request then the ticket has to go through an additional 'Awaiting Approval' stage. The next step is to broadcast messages to the volunteers added in our database based on their location and the requester's location.

"Weather Gecko","Gives the user a score for different activities, that could affect assets under your Geico insurance coverage, using AccuWeather API weather data.","[6164, ""As we were browsing the challenges for this semesters hackathon, we stumbled across Geico's challenge. It's goal is to bring an activity score to different activities that have something to do with the different insurance plans that Geico has. We thought this would be interesting since relating the weather to a risk factor is something we all subconsciously do when we ask for the weather in the morning, and having something to quantify it in a more specific manner sounded interesting. "", 'We thought this would be a great time to try out AccuWeather APIs to relate various weather conditions and warnings to make the score for these activities. We uses the AccuWeather APIs to gather a multitude of weather data that could give a score for some of the Geico insurance types. This combination of weather data and info on the insurance plans were put into custom functions that quantify a final score for each activity. ', ""We started off by splitting into two teams, one to understand how to use the AccuWeather API for our data collecting, and the other to figure out what data from the API had an impact on the different Geico Insurance Policies. For both of these purposes we chose to start out with Java.AccuWeatherOnce we had the understanding and initial implementation of the API, we began learning how to ping the AccuWeather site for our data and store it as usable variables in Java. We settled on using the Location, Forecast, Current Conditions, and Weather Alerts API's from AccuWeather. CalculationsMeanwhile, the other team was listing the measurements each insurance plan was affected by. Using these values, we created equations that deducted points from the max of 100 to get a final score for each insurance type. The points were subtracted based on the severity of the weather conditions. The insurance plans we settled on were Automotive, Motorcycle/ATV, Wellness and Fitness, Boating, and Air Travel. WebsiteOnce both of these were completed, we added in the data and equations to get our final values in Java. These final values were calculated on the GlassFish server via a Java Bean using a portion of the javax library. The Java Bean acts as a consolidator for all the data from the different API's.The results are then displayed to the customer on our mock Geico website. The first page prompts the user to enter their zip code and gives them a short description of the site. The Second page gives the scores for each of the insurance types and the risks of participating in those types of activities (ex. Car Travel, Boating, etc.). The Third and final page shows a breakdown of the weather conditions for someone who is also interested in the details. "", ""The largest challenge that we ran into when tackling this project was properly writing the network code in order to access the AccuWeather API. We encountered a few issues where our API key appeared to be acting up even though our request URL appeared to be correct. This resulted in us spending the first few hours trying to get any sort of response from the API. But once we got data out of the API, we weren't out of the woods yet. We still needed to take the data and manipulate it into a form we could use. We spend a considerable amount of time browsing Java libraries to find the best way to turn our data into something usable in our project plan.Another big challenge we ran into was the creation of the scales for each activity. A lot of the activities used some similar data sets but they all had their own specializations that we had to work around. The team had to come together and brainstorm/search for the danger zones of things such as temperature and precipitation. With these thresholds, we then created equations from the scores by using the data affecting the attribute of weather at maximum conditions, and equating that to a maximum score deduction (100). With this we had scaling equations for each of the weather equations. "", 'One of the things we are proud of is how quickly we got on task. Once we decided on a topic, we switched into high gear and got a lot of the groundwork started very quickly and efficiently. Because of this quick startup, it made the rest of the project when we came together and connected the two halves more manageable.Another thing we are proud of is our organization and steps we took to properly choose which weather conditions affected which of the insurance plans. This also led into creating all of our equations for the final activity ratings which, even though they were challenging, they are something that really shaped the outcome of this project. ', 'We learned how to use the AccuWeather API and what goes into the compiling of data into a usable format. We also got to learn about how to talk with a data center (AccuWeather) through the internet and ping it for data. With the data we received, we also learned how to make a usable format out of this through custom formulas and weighting. The combination of these things allowed us to get a better understanding of data processing and compilation, which was something we were excited to learn about and use.

"Icebreaker ","The easy way to break the ice and make better connections at events. Designed with introverts in mind, Icebreaker helps find common interests &amp; allies before you even arrive at an event.","[6524, 'The emerged from our team member Simon. As a former RA, counselor, and perpetual introvert, Simon experienced firsthand the anxiety-inducing circumstances of meeting new people. Whether it’s your first day of school, a work conference, your friend’s house party, or (gasp) a Facebook hackathon, there’s no shortage of ways to improve the experience of fostering connections. Icebreakers can be effective, but they’re often in large groups, which can be impersonal and overwhelming. Too much time and stress is spent on making it perfect and finding the right moment and topic to talk about. With millennials there is also a trend of more hours spent on social media. A study by the guardian found that social media usage is linked to higher rates of depression for young adults. (https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/04/depression-in-girls-linked-to-higher-use-of-social-media) Our experience, Icebreaker, set out to allow the digital familiarity of social media to reduce the anxiety of meeting new people in person. We started by identifying who our target user we were building this for was. Our target user is an introverted, sometimes quiet, person between the ages of 18 - 35 years old. For simplicity\'s sake let\'s call them Rick. Rick has a lot of interests and has many unique experiences that make him a fascinating person to talk with but struggles to share his interests, likes, and overall personality in social settings. When he finds 1 person he can go deep with at an party, his night is made! But finding that 1 person comes with anxiety, stress, prep, memorization of icebreakers, and sometimes... it doesn\'t seem worth it so he avoids going all together. We took these insights from Rick and created a solution that gives Rick all of the ""good"" and none of the ""stress."" We created this tool because with data, a few questions, and social media we can help people have more and better conversations. Everyone has a story.

Inspired by the wonderful multiplayer experiences of Jackbox Games (https://jackboxgames.com/) and Spyfall (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyfall --> https://spyfall.crabhat.com/), Icebreaker is meant to foster deeper connections between people, based around the topics they’d like to talk about.

Once in a room there\'s a Tinder-like swiping on questions (e.g. music, politics, food, TV, coding, etc) to create a profile. In other words, in a 1:1 conversation with someone, would you want to talk about this? Do you want to dive deep with someone in answering this question? Swipe left for no and right for yes.Instantly, you see a list of everyone else in the room, sorted by your top match based on the questions you’d both like to answer.

"Braven career connect","A backend system and UI platform to connect students with career goals to professionals in those fields at a mock interview event","[6694, 'Most of us in the team are graduate students and we totally understand how important it is for students to be prepared for interviews. Getting valuable feedback from industry professionals and identifying areas to improve is incredibly important for students beginning their careers.Braven is an inspiring organization that teaches students how to pursue their career goals. The number of students they teach has been rapidly growing in the past year, and they need to update their processes to handle this expansion. One of the challenges they face is running their mock interview events. These events are an opportunity for students to get valuable time with industry experts and practice their interview skills. Braven needs an efficient way to map students to interviewers with the same interests and skillsets for mock interviews. We resonate with this idea and intend to contribute in the best ways we can.Current ProcessIn the way the system works today, the people at Braven must individually collect updated interests and skillsets from each student via email. Then they match each student with two unique interviewers, ensuring that the interviewer is scheduled to have only one student for each time slot. While this process was reasonable when they were managing fewer students and professionals, this is not a scalable solution. ', 'Our solution attempts to streamline the interviewee and interviewer mapping process in order to make it efficient and scalable.

We have some great ideas on Natural Language Processing regarding extraction of career interests from user-profiles, connecting the front end to more information on the backend that will reduce the work of the people at Braven and give a better experience for students and professionals.Event recommendation: Based on students' and volunteers' past history, we can gather data on similar users and recommend events for students and volunteers with similar interests.Based on users' information on career interests in the profile section, we can extract the skillset from both students' and volunteers' profiles. We can apply natural language processing (named entity recognition) and auto-fill their career interests. This would further help in increasing the accuracy of the interviewer to interviewee mapping.

"Diversify","Image-to-image translation for improved dataset diversity","[3610, ""Neural networks are powerful computer vision techniques which can map one image to another.  However, they are so effective that a new problem is rising; models are sensitive to image intensity heterogeneity.  One such example are computer vision systems which fail to operate over images of people of color, women, or those with non-traditional hair colors.The issue of neural network failure on these images lies in the dataset, as such models only will learn what they are given.  That is, the lack of diversity in machine learning datasets leads to neural networks that only make decisions based on that data.  If a neural network trains on a dataset in which all minorities are labeled as criminals, for example, then the neural network will overfit to this data and learn this mapping.  This is obviously undesirable and has heavy ethical consequences.StarGAN is a convolutional neural network model which permits style transfer from one set of categories to another set of categories.  Its ability to change a person's face, hair, age, and skin color can be a first step forward towards improving diversity in already existent datasets.  In tandem, we hope that data houses will strive to collect data which is more properly representative of the diversity we have on this planet.

We made this program to ensure the safety of the people in our day and age. We want to prevent the loss of family and loved ones that occurs when the tragic event happens. If we can warn people early before the event happens, then maybe it could lessen the harsh injuries or deaths. "", ""The point of the project is to identify weapons on a person, and be able to warn people ahead of time if they are pulling the weapon. The software goes through every pixel on an image and looks for colors and shapes that resemble the a gun. The pixels that resemble a gun will be marked red. Ideally, this sotware would be implimented in the surviellence cameras in schools, hospitals, and other public areas in order to warn officials when someone is carrying a gun in unauthorized areas. Due to the time restriction and current skillset, we weren't able to able to make our software work with live video but we used images as a concept.How I Built ThisThis software was built using Matlab. We thought it would be interesting to use a non-traditional language. We would import an image and the code would find trends in color and shape that resembled a gun. The code would find the center point of the gun and highlight it red as well as other pixels in the image that resembled a gun. Once the code was done processing the image, it would display image before and after processing.Challenges I ran intoWe have faced a challenge of learning a new language. It took time learning how most of the format works on the Matlab language at the beginning. Guns are typically black so it was difficult to get the program to not highlight everything dark. It was also difficult getting the centroid of the weapon. We spent a lot of time trying to make the red highlights opaque but were uncessful.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofWorking on a project that involved imaging processing was a daughting task for us. We had never done such a thing before but thought this would be a great opportunity to learn.What I learnedWe learned how to import images to matlab and modify them as well as add objects to the image. Learning more about the RBG scale was also fun.What's next for Safety IdentificationIn the future, we will make the software outline and highlight guns with greater accuracy.

"Victor CX","Auditory CUI for visually impaired or differently-abled users","[7758, ""There are an estimated 36 million blind and 217 million people worldwide with severe visual impairments. This represents a significant potential customer base that is currently being underserved by products and services that rely on a visual medium like web pages and visual devices like touch screens on smartphones for customer communication, information, and support. The experience of these users with products and services delivered through computing devices that have mice or touchscreens as the primary input method will always be more difficult than sighted users. People who are blind or visually impaired or disabled stood to benefit the most from the computer and information revolution and the explosion of hardware devices and mobile computer form-factors. But for these people reality has fallen far-short of expectations. It is true that GUI operating environments like Windows and MacOS and Android, and document formats like HTML and PDF have made huge strides in being accessible to visually impaired and disabled users. But user interfaces today still make fundamental assumptions about the medium of presentation of information and the mode of interaction with users, which can make using desktop or Web applications and forms or documents frustrating and time-consuming for sight-impaired users. GUI applications may conform to desktop accessibility guidelines and web-sites and pages and documents may follow recommendations like WCAG and ARIA. But navigation through desktop and web applications is still spatially oriented and visual users can see and immediately rank in importance navigation elements like windows, menus, trees, buttons, et.al while using a visual input marker like a mouse cursor to select the desired element or content. Information like calendars or tables or forms when presented visually use the visual layout as an important part of the meaning, Non-visual users who rely on screen-readers must often wade through a sea of elements and text before finding the desired function or content, and must rely on trial-and-error, repetition, and memory to be able to efficiently navigate a GUI. The increasing complexity of desktop and mobile GUIs today may benefit and seem intuitive to experienced visual users, but can also leave non-visual or differently-abled users far worse off than older interfaces. Today's complex GUIs make assumptions about the sight acuity or dexterity or short-term information processing abilities of users that can end up excluding a significant proportion of users or potential customers.Conversational user interfaces are among the easiest and most accessible forms of human-computer interaction and have seen a revival today on desktop and mobile devices powered by sophisticated natural language understanding and machine learning services running in the cloud. But most chatbots and CUIs today assume that the user can see the active conversation or activity or skill on-screen and can easily navigate and click on buttons or windows or other widgets when needed. CUIs today used to access  information like customer service may simply act as a director to web pages that are still heavily dependent on the assumption of a visual medium for presentation of information. For visually impaired users, a web pages may cause a screen reader to flood the user with information with no way to filter or narrow down what the user needs actually needs.To adequately serve the millions of blind and visually-impaired potential customers, organizations need to look beyond mere accessibility into truly inclusive interfaces that cater directly to the strengths and weaknessess of non-visual users.  Auditory user interfaces, like Emacspeak and other work pioneered by T.V. Raman can fundamentally change the customer experience for millions of non-visual users and businesses investing in this technology may find an untapped market for their products and services and a real source of brand and customer loyalty.  "", ""Victor CX is a client-server system which provides a multi-modal conversational user interface client and server back-end for interacting with an organisation's online services like product registration and on-boarding, product documentation, customer service and support, business processes like applying for a loan or for admission to a school, and other customer experience applications that traditionally rely on a user's ability to navigate a GUI and visual presentation of documents and forms. Victor CX is specifically designed for users who are blind or sight-impaired or who are otherwise not able to effectively use a traditional GUI with mouse input, and must rely on assistive technologies like screen-readers or braille displays. It uses a simplified, conversation-driven interface that can run either on a character-based terminal or in a browser as a web application. Victor produces line-by-line output that is easily read by screen readers and line-driven interactive input that can be easily entered via any kind of keyboard or character input device, or via speech recognition for users who cannot use such devices.The backend consists of a scalable chatbot server which contains the CUI logic for different bots and tracks and persists the conversation state for each client interaction witha bot, as well as as a web API which is called by CUI bots to retrieve content or run operations or interact with an organizations existing services.Victor CX let's organizations create auditory user interfaces for customer experience that integrate with existing business processes and services and content and which alsosatisfy the 7 inclusive design principlesProvide comparable experienceConsider situationBe consistentGive controlOffer choicePrioritise contentAdd valueVictor CX provides a 100% open-source alternative to proprietary CUI services like Google's Dialogflow, Microsoft's LUIS, wit.al, et.al.

"FINALIST: CatchUp!","Rekindling old friendships doesn't have to be awkward or time-consuming. CatchUp! is a productivity app that streamlines the reach-out process with efficient, ready-made conversation starters.","[4457, ""Making new friends as an adult isn’t easy. But trying to reconnect with an old friend can be even more challenging—especially if you haven’t spoken in years. Even though many people desperately want to revive old friendships, they rarely take the chance to do so because of miscalibrated predictions of awkwardness. In truth, however, catching up with an old friend can be a wonderful experience for everyone. We believe that all people need is just a lil' push. CatchUp! exists as a productive catalyst for helping users re-cross familiar paths of their unforgotten past. Facebook has made it possible to be connected with hundreds of old friends at a time. But we want to stop these connections from turning into virtual “friendships” that passively exist on your News Feed by empowering users to take the first step. "", 'At its core, CatchUp! is a productivity app because it utilizes your existing social network for efficient relationship management and streamlines the check-in process using handy conversation starters, dramatically cutting the time you take agonizing about what to say without sounding awkward.  Before building, we incorporated user research and dove into secondary resources, addressing three major pain points when it comes to rekindling old friendships:1) People aren\'t sure if the feelings are mutual — With time and distance in between, it can be difficult to know whether an old friend is willing to catch up with you. That\'s why, on CatchUp!, people can message each other only if they have mutually marked the other as an old friend through the ""Add Contacts"" feature, saving face and cognitive effort.2) People aren\'t sure of what to say — Too many people waste time thinking about the best approach for catching up. Using our ready-made, friendly conversation starters, users can quickly build the stage for more personal or meaningful conversations later on. Start small, end big.  3) People aren\'t sure where their old friends are anymore — When friends drift apart, it\'s hard to keep track of where they are around the world. CatchUp! saves people\'s time by notifying users when they\'re near an old friend using Friend Alert notifications. Organizing meetups or casual coffee chats with old pals has never been easier. ', 'We used Sketch to build a prototype of app UI and to create our logo. We used React Native to build the mobile application and Github to share our code. ', 'Getting all the infrastructure set up to develop this app took longer than we all previously thought. We learned the importance of planning ahead to make sure we hit the grown running (or coding!) when we meet as a team. Likewise, we also found it challenging to divide the workload into small, discrete tasks; this is an area where early planning would be a huge help. Also, although having designers and developers together was good, we had a tough time figuring out the best way to collaborate technology-wise.  ', ""CatchUp! is not your typical productivity app, but it's definitely one of the most important ones. We embarked on a unique mission—to build a tool that harmoniously blends the personal and the practical together such that more people can take control of their social lives.  "", 'We now have a better grasp of how to conceptualize a minimum viable product and to prioritize the necessary tasks and functions related to said product.  ', 'We have some ideas on how to improve CatchUp! in the future.1) Incorporating more dynamic, personalized conversation starters, such as GIFs, memes, old but shared photos/jokes.2) Using AI to make the ready-made chat prompts more user-specific (based on their Facebook profile)  ']","['adobe-illustrator', 'react-native', 'sketch', 'material-design']","False","0","['yenakim', 'jiaqigao', 'yvesshum']","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/876/670/datas/small.png","True","0"
"THAP-THAN","AGRICULTURAL WASTES TO COMPOSTE","[2530, ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'Agricultural residues or residues in Egypt are estimated at 26-40 million tons / year. This is confirmed by the statistics of the economic affairs sector in the Ministry of Agriculture and the researches of the Agricultural Research Center and the recycling thereof does not exceed only 12% of this quantity and the other millions of tons are disposed of either by burning or Throwing them in canals and banks! The same studies acknowledge the seriousness of the burning of these wastes, which lead to serious health and environmental damage. The recycling of agricultural waste, according to statistics, is easier scientifically and technologically, yet millions of tons of agricultural waste continue to accumulate in front of us every year, leaving mountains of wasted wealth that we cannot deal with only burning and managing our back with all positive solutions.The treatment of agricultural waste is limited to the traditional uses of farmers or is completely eliminated by burning and the result. A black cloud of smoke is not only caused by burning rice straw but caused by other types of waste, which causes an increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide, and therefore a rise in temperature and the consequent change in climate threatens the entire planet with the worst disasters.The phenomenon of open burning is one of the environmental problems that face the Egyptian society in all its sects. It leads to pollution of the environment by severe air pollution attacks that affect the population in the cities and villages with various respiratory diseases and acute episodes of coughing and irritation which start annually during the seasons of maize harvest in Assiut Governorate ( at Upper Egypt ) from August to the end of November. Wind activity during the fall period also leads to the spread of a black cloud that is characterized by heavy black smoke. Farmers burn residues and agricultural residues until they dispose of them, thinking they are fertilizing the land. So I should look for solutions to this problem.
