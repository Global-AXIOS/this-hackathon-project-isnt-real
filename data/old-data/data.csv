Upon doing further research, we realized that these terms do not actually convey the expiration date of the product. For example, the term ""best buy"" is when the flavor is the best, not when the product expires. Over 33% of participants in a study conducted last year incorrectly assumed date labeling is federally regulated and another 26% were unsure.

"Regen Network - ReDAOMint","A reDAOmint is a DeFi mechanism that encourages investors to invest in the future ecological health of the planet in a way that generates win-win scenarios for everyone involved","[7775, ""Protecting Earth's most precious natural environments - such as the Amazon rainforest - is often dangerously dependent on unstable political and economic forces. While the Amazon's critical importance as a carbon sink, source of oxygen, and biodiversity hotspot is widely acknowledged worldwide, the local economics in inhabited portions of the forest are often not conducive to protecting this planetary treasure. Instead of relying on government policies and inefficient charities, what if we could create a decentralized economic vehicle that made long-term protection of the forest economically beneficial for local residents?  "", 'For a slide-show presentation see https://bit.ly/redaomint. For a screen-cast see: https://share.getcloudapp.com/NQuejBzyA reDAOmint (regenerative + endowment + DAO + tendermint) is a shareholder DAO that holds a pool of assets for perpetuity, distributing the dividends of those assets with land stewards in critical bioregions in exchange for protecting the land. The DAO funds itself by minting new shares in exchange for valuable market assets that produce dividends or rewards (such as staking tokens).The assets in the DAO are managed by the shareholders who can rebalance the portfolio and move staking tokens to their parent zones over IBC to delegate them and collect rewards. Through good management of the funds, the asset value should grow and produce dividends. The dividends cannot, however, be directly withdrawn by the shareholders - they are instead distributed to land stewards whose good land stewardship has been verified, ideally by a low cost technology such as satellite verification (something Regen Network is already actively working on).Land stewards enter into a contract with the DAO to protect the land, and as long as they keep protecting it they will receive dividends on a regular basis. This provides a continuous supplementary income stream for these land stewards. If, however, they degrade the land by deforesting it, their share of DAO rewards gets slashed, returned to the DAO and they can no longer participate. In this way the reDAOmint acts as a long term financial support vehicle for the land, which goes beyond what unstable government or non-profit support could provide.For investors in the reDAOmint, the investment is not, however, simply a charity and could also be consider a decentralize public hedgefund. reDAOmint shares provide dividends that come in the form of ecosystem service credits. These credits represent unaccounted ecological benefits from protecting the land which is an emerging asset class  estimated to grow from 36B USD in 2017 to 1T USD over next 20 years. An example of these are carbon credits, which will be increasingly demanded by governments and the public. reDAOmint shareholders can either use the ecosystem service credits they have received as dividends for their own offseting purposes or sell them on the market.In comparison to traditional mechanisms for protecting land, a reDAOmint provides the following benefits:insulates land stewards from seasonal variation in the ecological health of landinsulates land stewards from volatility in the price of ecosystem service creditsefficiently generates ecosystem services by good capital managementauditability of all funding and verification activity ', 'The reDAOmint is built using the Cosmos SDK using a fork of cosmos/gaia that includes IBC support. A diff of our work can be seen here: https://github.com/regen-network/reDAOmint/pull/3.We produced two new Cosmos modules and an ORM package to create the reDAOmint.redaomint moduleThe redaomint module implements a shareholder DAO that produces dividends of ecosystem service credits for shareholders and dividends of the underlying asset pool for allocated land stewards as described above. It also provides governance proposal and voting support for shareholders. It uses the existing Cosmos bank and supply modules to track holdings of shares, and interacts with the ecocredit module for verification of good land stewardship and distributing credits. The primary documentation for the module can be found here: https://github.com/regen-network/reDAOmint/blob/reDAOmint/x/redaomint/keeper.goecocredit moduleThe ecocredit module provides a fractional NFT with metadata specific to ecosystem service credits. It allows for:the creation of new credit classes with a list of approved issuersthe issuance of credits for a specific piece of land and time frameexchange of fractional portions of individual creditsburning credits in order to remove them from circulation (in the language of carbon credits this is called retiring and means that you are using the credit as an offset)Documentation here: https://github.com/regen-network/reDAOmint/blob/reDAOmint/x/ecocredit/keeper.goorm packageIn order to make the implementation of the above modules easier, we implemented an orm package to handle secondary indexes and the automatic generation of ID\'s. This is inspired by the Weave SDK\'s and is something we\'ve been intending to build for a while. While it was its own ""mini-project"", it greatly simplified implementation of the other code. ', ""we intended to use IBC to connect to the DEX and query price data in order to mint new reDAOmint shares using a bonding curve.

In my biomedical research laboratory, people forget to order fresh lab supplies. These supplies include ingredients to a drug, reagents for a diagnostic device... anything! This means we can accidentally be using expired reagents or have development delays because of this oversight. To reduce the burden of needing to remember to order new lab supplies (when it's tough to, when you're in a lab with no computer around...) I made a Amazon Dash-like device with buttons that users can press, which sends an email and text to the lab manager requesting ordering of low supplies.

This price discrepancy is clearly reflected in usage statistics. Today, DEXes mediate less than one percent of daily crypto trading volume. To work towards changing this, we decided to focus on a single segment of the exchange sector, stablecoin swaps, where DEXes have the largest potential cost advantage. Our product, Squink, will enable users to swap between different stablecoins at less than half of the cost of any existing service.   ', 'Squink is an automated market maker that enables extremely low cost swaps between USD stablecoins, e.g. DAI, USDC, and Terra. Fees for utilizing Squink are in the range of 0.05 percent of exchanged volume or $0.50 USD for a $1000 exchange. This is less than half the cost of Binance, the cheapest existing provider. Much like Uniswap, Squink is a lightweight plug n’play module that is easy to integrate into other financial and non-financial products. By integrating Squink, decentralized exchange aggregators can take advantage of small differentials between prices quoted in DAI, USDC, Terra, etc. to save their users substantial amounts of money. Likewise, the exchanges themselves can utilize Squink to aggregate their stablecoin trading pairs into a single integrated order book that offers better prices and deeper liquidity. Finally, e-commerce sites can uitilize Squink to accept any stablecoin, while still receiving payment in their preferred currency.     ', ""Under the hood, Squink uses a generalization of the Uniswap constant product formula that allows for multiple assets and a user-specified level of price volatility.

Although the novelty can be exhilarating, taking flight and seeking out a new social support system may prove to be a daunting task.  Yet, no matter the people we hold close in our lives, from those we’ve known our entire lives to the lab partner we met just a few weeks ago, having those people in our community means the same: ensuring that we feel connected, safe, and taken care of.We wanted to make that process of building and maintaining community easier.  Especially in a major metropolitan city like Austin, safety can be of paramount concern.  Whether they walk, scooter, or rideshare, our final salutation in seeing people off is wishing them safe travels.  Even after departing the nest, Birdie lets you and your loved ones know that those in your community have made it to their destination safely. What is DoesOur app allows users to send/share a history of their location data to those within their community.  The sender presses a button to start their trip, sending friends/family a notification.  From there, receivers can view the person’s trip by viewing the path they followed on a map.  Afterwards, the sender presses a button to end the trip they scheduled, allowing others to know they arrived safely.What Makes it Different?Other location trackers only provide a live view of where people are.  Although this is useful, allowing others to be notified of when you take a trip allows for a practical experience.  For instance, you can send your location on FaceBook messenger, but this can get lost in the messages.  Apps like Strava may be able to track paths you take, but are primarily geared towards running and exercise without having features dedicated to safety.  We wanted an elegant app dedicated for safety that allows for convenient, practical sharing of location.How we Built itWe created our app in Android App Studio, using Google Firebase as a server to store and transmit location data.

At a high school level, we noticed that dividing up into teams, specifically for group projects, was very much inline with privilege - a psychological effect known as in group favoritism. As a result, the effects of inequality became amplified, and social mobility becomes nearly impossible. Similarly, people with similar personality traits tend to group together, which minimizes diversity of thought and leads to, on average, worse team performance (Hoffman and Maier, 1961). Using the ""big five"" personality factors that determine team success (Kichuk and Wiesner, 1997), we created a tool that would prioritize diversity of thought in group creation - with aims of improving group performance and enhancing social mobility. ', 'Students take a short Google Form personality quiz, including short answer questions that are ""graded"" through sentiment analysis.

When teachers create new groups, using a self made GUI, the clusters of likeminded individuals are as split up as possible, leading to teams that reflect optimal diversity. ', 'We used python to create both the GUI and the backend. Using the google-api, we scraped results of the Google Forms and input them into a clustering algorithm powered by sklearn. A one-zero distance metric was used for determining the loss associated with different answers to multiple choice questions. Sentiment analysis was performed by parsing student inputs and searching for positive and negative words (from the canonical list of 6000 training words), and determining which direction the sentiment was more likely to be. On the GUI side, we used tkinter to create a graphic for teacher use. Teachers need only input the URL to google form results and the number of groups they seek to create, and GroupYou will generate the associated teams and display them in the GUI.

"Everett: Reloaded","Think PoS is economically sound? Think again.","[7689, 'With the recent gain of popularity of Proof of Stake (PoS), we have found out that nearly all research focus only on the security aspects of it. Even though PoS vastly changes the economic fundamentals of a blockchain platform, the actual research done regarding the potential problems that could arise was found to be quite lacking compared to its severity.Through our own analysis of PoS, we have discovered quite a few that can be potentially damaging to the ecosystem. The ones found can largely the classified into three categories: Economic, Security, and Market.Economic: Users are given two choices to invest their tokens, staking and DeFi. This causes DeFi lending rates to rise to a level similar to the staking reward rate, decreasing the amount of social benefit generated from DeFi. It also disincentivizes the usage of DeFi, one example being CDP holders having to miss out on potential staking rewards. Interchain transfers of PoS tokens are also disincentivized, as tokens moved outside of their home chain cannot receive staking rewards. The Cosmos network, aiming to connect various different chains, is critically impacted by this.Security: The only way for delegators to hedge in the case of bear markets is to first go through the unbonding process. This also decreases the network security, creating a situation where the security of the network is impacted by the price fluctuation of tokens. Also, ATOMs being used in dApps cannot be delegated and thus unable to contribute to security. This forces token usage to compete with network security, and since less ATOMs will be bonded, this will also cause the Cosmos Hub to have higher inflation.Market: Users are unable to utilize their bonded ATOMs for hedging or speculation purposes. In addition, since the only entity with an incentive to not bond their ATOMs are centralized exchanges (to process withdrawals), a considerable amount of unbonded ATOMs might end up in the hands them. And since only unbonded ATOMs can be traded and contribute to token valuation, the risk of exchanges colluding with each other and manipulating the price might not be that difficult to pull off.As a small addition to the above problems, developed economies have investment products with various amounts of risk and reward. However, for PoS networks, is not the case (Risk: Slashing Possibility. Reward: Delegation Rewards). Even if there are people who truly believe in the platform prefer to take more risks in exchange for a higher amount of rewards, they have no choice but to follow the same risk & reward profiles as everyone else. ', 'With the use of Everett, delegators of the Cosmos Hub are able to mint bATOMs, a secondary shadow token backed by one’s delegation position. Two important features of bATOMs ensure them as an effective solution to the problems mentioned above.Soft Peg with ATOMs: bATOMs are designed to retain the same price with ATOMs. Just like most people treat WETH & ETH and DAI & USD as the same type of asset although they are completely different, by making bATOMs have the same price as ATOMs will minimize the adoption barrier for users and DeFi dApps.Validator Fungibility: Another important feature for maximum usability is issue the same type of tokens independent of which validator the delegator chose to delegate to. Compressing them to a single token ensures both maximum user simplicity and market liquidity.The eventual goal of bATOMs is to become the preferred token of choice for DeFi applications, so that delegators can utilize the bATOMs created using their delegated ATOMs and utilize them on various DeFi applications. This allows users to collect both the delegation rewards and the DeFi dApp interest, eliminating the competitive structure between those two, which in turn maximizes the social benefit.What can I do with itHedging & Speculation: A delegator can now choose to utilize the locked value of their bonded ATOMs are applications like hedging or speculating.Stake & Invest: It is now possible to delegate ATOMs and lend the generated bATOMs through DeFi. Increasing profits for users without causing a decrease in network security.Interchain Staking: Delegators can stake on multiple chains with the same capital by trading bATOMs in exchange for unstaked tokens of other blockchains.Leveraged Delegations: bATOMs can be traded for more unbonded ATOMs, which can be delegated to generate more bATOMs. By repeating this process delegators can effectively leverage on their delegations. This application is further explored by tokenizing the leveraged position and making them available for trading. ', 'As the Cosmos Hub does not support smart contracts or token issuance, it was decided to develop a separate Cosmos Zone that takes care of the smart contract logic and bATOM issuance. To prevent events like slashing from creating undercollateralized LSPs, it was decided to keep 10% of the bonded ATOMs as the slashing collateral. Whenever the slashed amount goes over 5%, the Everett Zone automatically submits an unbonding request to the Cosmos Hub, therefore liquidating the LSP in the risk of undercollateralization.A previously suggested ICS proposal regarding interchain accounts was utilized. This proposal allows the creation of a special address on the Cosmos Hub, which is controlled by Cosmos Zone. This feature is crucial in order for forced liquidations to be triggered in the case of slashings that go beyond the threshold amount.Simplified bATOM Generation Process Generate an Everett Zone controlled user-specific interchain address on the Cosmos Hub Transfer ATOMs to the newly created interchain address Send data including the validator to delegate the transferred ATOMs to A delegate TX is sent to from the Everett Zone to the Cosmos Hub via IBC If all is successful, excluding the slashing collateral of 10%, new bATOMs are granted to the delegator’s addressSimplified ATOM Recovery Process Requests the closure of one’s LSP by submitting a close TX to the Everett Zone The Everett Zone validates whether the user has enough funds in their account If the user’s account contains enough bATOMs, the bATOMs are locked and the ATOM retrieval process is initiated. An unbonding TX is sent from the Everett Zone to the Cosmos Hub If 4 is successful, the locked ATOMs in 3 are burnedA LSP can only be closed by the delegator who initially opened it. The delegator is required to hold the same amount of bATOMs they first created.TLDR of the add-ons done during the hackathon Swapped out our previous pseudo-IBC in exchange for the real thingUse of Interchain Accounts A better frontend for non-aliens Liquid Staking Position (LSP) NFTs, an additional token that has governance rights & receives rewards Tokenized Leveraged LSPs, allowing delegators to choose different risk & reward profiles (e.g. buy 3x leverage LSP tokens to receive 3x the rewards, while the money you lose when slashed also increases 3x.)

"Bounded Chaos","Reinterpreting cellular automata to include a messaging system that allows us to map an input space onto itself in a very unique way. ","[5318, ""Ahmed's short backstory: I was watching tv late one night while living in Brazil, when the signal cut out. I was mesmerized by the random pattern of pixels oscillating on the screen, knowing that a specific percentage of them were caused by cosmic background radiation. Despite the random cosmic element on the tv screen, the pattern was very similar to the deterministic cellular automata I was playing with on my computer. This fascinated me. One pattern was random and the other was deterministic but not chaotic, and yet, the two were indistinguishable from one another. This inspired me to ask the question: if all it takes to create these crazy patterns are a very simple set of deterministic functions mapping onto one another, then what is random, and what really is chaotic? What else would I be able to produce? There's beauty in chaos. Key wordsHilbert (space filling) curveCellular automataRecursive mappingCombinatronicsDebrujin SequencesMemory "", ""We're exploring the evolutionary dynamics of these cellular automata and visualizing them for an audience unfamiliar with the math. We've provided the theoretical underpinning of this framework, coupled with a simple graphical interface that demonstrates the localized effect of the interaction between two arbitrary rules. Cellular automata provide a way to bound chaotic inputs amongst a closed set of states.Independent of how complex your pattern is, you can always recurse deeper into the solution space because you can always generate more intricate inputs to be processed through the rule set that you have. This maximizes the amount of information you're extracting about the patterns in those inputs. This is why chaos is now bounded. You're simply limited by the processing power you have to recurse through this infinite space as compared to the complexity of the pattern you're seeking. "", ""Basically we reinterpreted cellular automata to separate the input space from the message space. What that means is we can run cellular automata in three different ways, forming a chain of actions and interactions. The visualization we created takes an ordered image (gradient mapped along a hilbert curve) and disturb it by passing the inputs through a randomly chosen pair of cellular automata rules and observing the localized effects of their interactions. Message = Rule(Input)Rule(s) = Input(Message)Input(s) = Rule(Input)Passing an input through a rule to receive a message reduces the amount of information we can extract from it, because running that message backwards to extrapolate the initial input in fact can only give you a possibility space that contains probable inputs that generated that message. Sp when you group two rules and a message, what you're creating is a mapping between one input space onto another input space, where only some of those inputs are relevant. To do this, we setup an ordered hilbert curve and used colour to express that order. Then we disturbed that order by choosing two random rules and seeing how the curve visually translates when run through them. The function we used to update the colour values is the same used in reinforcement learning to update the reward expectations.

"Duke Tutor","A Remote Tutoring Platform for Duke Students","[4084, ""We believe that tutoring is an integral component of achieving academic success. Duke's current tutoring system is restrictive with a strict one tutor policy, lacks transparency because of the little to no agency a student has in choosing their tutor, and is expected to be an in person interaction. With so much homework, programming, and projects done on computers and online, there is an opportunity for transparent and flexible tutoring to be made available in this environment. For example, most of the work for EGR 103 requires programming. To supplement face-to-face sessions, tutors may want to access a student's machine remotely and provide assistance.

Analysis of this data can be used to discover relations between different teaching and learning styles which can help improve approaches and strategies to tutoring.  "", ""Duke tutor is a remote tutoring platform that connects students with tutors and provides a flexible, effective, and interactive tutoring experience. Tutors registered with Duke tutor each have a profile including the class they tutor for, what time slots they can tutor at, and their type of teaching style. When students access Duke tutor, they first pick the class they want a tutor for and are presented a calendar of all tutors and their available times for that class. Students have the ability to view each tutor's profile to evaluate which tutor best matches them. A choice is made when the student chooses the name of the tutor, the time slot, and the learning style the best identify with. Once the request is verified, an email is sent to both the tutor and student including a link to the virtual tutoring session as well as a feedback form. The virtual session includes functions such as voice chat, screen share, and the control of a device from another device.

Probus will have an initial offering of tokens and then move to a generative model where more participation on the platform will lead to the creation/issuing of more tokens. Smart flagging is done by agents wherein a set number of agents participate in voting on whether a piece of content should be flagged or not.

When the “CALL” button is pressed, the application would use the GPS to get the user’s location and use text-to-speech to convert the address into sound form so that the police would hear it — however, no sound would come out from the phone so that the user can remain undiscovered.Furthermore, when the “MESSAGE” button is pressed, the application would lead to a screen where the user can choose which counselor she/he wants to receive counseling and support from and start texting anonymously with the counselor. The counselor would not be able to see the phone number or any other personal information of the user, because the user is never required to enter anything.Accomplishment-We created a clearly-manifested home screen with only two buttons to press as well as a location detection function so that users who need to call the police can do it right away.-The Message function was created on a second screen, where the user can select a counsellor, sending text messages to the selected counselor, receive responses, and the latest messages are displayed.-The Call function would directly call 911 as soon as the user presses the button.ChallengesAll of our team members were first-time hackers entirely new to the field of application development.

', ""Login or sign up in the main page, the user's first name, last name, email and password would be collected and saved on Cloud Firestore database (which is powered by Firebase) for later login check. After successful login or signup, the user would be guided to the search page. On this page, he/she can use Google map to locate his/her position, he/she can also specify search radius within which medical centers and hospitals would be fetched from the MEDICARE HOSPITAL COMPARE DATASET. Then the user would be displayed with the distances and names of the hospitals and medical centers. Upon clicking on a specific hospital name, he could get the route on how to get to that hospital or medical center. Detailed information including address in text form, as well as overall rating of the facility would also be offered to the user. "", ""We started from defining different functionalities we would like to achieve. Then we dice deep into the corresponding components our app should include for those functionalities. Our implementation is in Xcode. We implement the backend using Google Firebase. More specifically, we user Firebase authentication library for user login and signup, and Firestore to store user information. We choose Firebase out of the consideration of reliability and stability. To fetch hospital and medical center information, we call API offered by the MEDICARE HOSPITAL COMPARE DATASET by giving a URL including the geolocation information of the user and the search radius defined by him/her. We've also added the functionalities of displaying route to the hospital and rating of it after the user pick one from the search results. "", ""The backend part was kind of challenging since neither of us had used Firebase as backend previously. But we made to learn how to use it and integrated with our Swift codes. Also using MapView in Xcode to locate user was hard at the beginning since we had not used this component previously. Debugging in the TableView part for displaying hospitals was really tricky. Last but not least: Hold on and don't give up! "", ""We're proud of the persistence both team members demonstrate under pressure. Both of us were newbies for some of the technologies in this project but we stood together and managed to accomplish the goals we set at the beginning. We're proud of the great collaboration between us and valued that as a great experience to learn how to work together with a short deadline. Last but not least, we are happy that we've managed to deliver something that is practical and can help solving a real health and wellness problem. "", ""A lot. We've learned new technologies and tools. We've learned how to be well disciplined under pressure. We've also learned how to collaborate and accomplish tasks with a short deadline. "", ""We would like further improve our UI design, offering more information on hospitals and medical centers. Another useful feature we consider to implement is to cache the search history of user locally in user's device. Then next time when he enters the app he can just check out the past search results if he wants instead of locating and searching again. Also adding features like making appointments to visit the hospital or medical center in the app, rating for the hospital the user has visited in our app will be part of the future work.

But there was a problem – while some shelters and donation drives overflowed with supplies, others were still empty-handed. Donations were often abundant in certain areas of the city, while the under-served communities that need them most went without. This inspired Full House- a system for managing and balancing the inventory of multiple shelters and leveling the playing field. ', 'Full House has two main functions.  First, to help shelters manage their inventory by determining scarcity or surplus. And second, to connect shelters with others that may have the supplies that they need. Full House accomplishes this with a search tool that lets users easily query the inventory, and with a dashboard that recommends other shelters.  ', ""The core of our product is connecting shelters together based on need. In order to get our data, we scraped Goodwill stores for product information, formatted them to be stored in our Mongo DB database, and kept track of their specific categories. With a set of categories, we could easily show what percentage of a shelter's inventory is made of a certain category, and allow shelters to specify what percentage they require.

"Chladni Plates: Simulation vs. Reality","We built physical Chladni Plate setup, which is a way to visualize the creation of standing sound waves. We also programmed a simulated Chladni plate in order to see the differences between the two.","[4334, ""We were inspired by demonstrations of this effect shown on Youtube. We wanted to see if we could build a simulator to arrive at the same results and to build our own Chladni plate from scratch. This initial inspiration was incubated by Dawson's SPACE extracurricular program who sponsored our presence at the hackathon and gave us all the opportunities we needed to succeed. "", 'In the physical model, we use an online tone generator to send sine wave sound frequencies to a speaker through a guitar amp. The speaker is attached to a driving rod, which acts as the vibration source for a metal plate attached to it. The vibration produces standing waves on the plate. By sprinkling salt on the plate we can visualize the nodal lines on the plate, as the salt will displace towards those line, away from the parts of the plate that are moving.The simulation displays a graph that represents a possible pattern of a square Chladni plate. Using interactive sliders you can change parameters to change the shape of the pattern to see other possibilities. ', 'We modded a guitar amp, replacing the built-in speaker with a speaker with a plastic cap, which allowed us to attach the driving rod to the center of the speaker. The driving rod is attached to the plate at the center. In order to keep the rod upright, we built a wooden support base which is mounted to the speaker. The simulation uses a given formula for representing the nodal lines of a Chladni plate derived from the 2D wave equation. Using a plotting library in Python we graphed the equation, displaying the Chladni pattern for the given parameters. ', 'Building the physical Chladni plate came with a host of challenges. Given our lack of construction resources, cutting the materials down to size and drilling the necessary holes took a good deal of time. Also, the patterns produced on the physical Chladni plate are very different from the complex patterns produced in the simulation, due to the nature of the build and the limitations of the materials. Plotting the equation ended up being more difficult than expected, as the library we used does not have an easy way of representing implicit curves (like the equation we are using). Another big challenge was getting the interactivity to work properly. However, we were able to eventually get over these challenges and arrived at the final product. ', 'The proudest accomplishment is that we actually managed to get both the physical and simulated demos to work in some degree. The challenges we had to deal with took a considerable amount of time and research to work through, as we are all happy that we arrived at a finished product we can be proud of. ', 'We had two major takeaways from this project. First, the math and physics of Chladni plates is much more complicated than any of us expected, involving 4th-degree PDEs and eigenfunctions, both of which are way above our level of knowledge as cegep students. Second, it is very difficult to build real simulations of physical phenomena in a way that closely fits the theoretical predictions. There are so many variables to take into account in the real world that being able to create a theoretically consistent simulation is a very difficult and impressive feat.   ', 'With some more research, we hope to be able to find the relationship between the driving frequency and the patterns produced by the plate so that the simulation can be adapted to accept frequency inputs. Once we have a better understanding of the physics, we hope we can also simulate non-square plates, eventually arriving at simulations for arbitrary plate shapes. However, given that the math is complicated enough for square plates, we recognize that the second goal would require extensive research and significant dedication to complete.

"Waitlist of Lucidity","Crowdsourced waitlist sizes for UT Austin Registration","[3540, ""It's registration season at UT Austin again! In a time that's supposed to be filled with hope and excitement, however, many students dread the prospect of seeing all their classes fill up before they register, not knowing which section of a class has the shortest waitlist to sign up for because UT doesn't show the size of a waitlist until a student is already on it. For example, a student picking the waitlist for a class section at random could end up at spot #20. However, he wouldn't know that he could have signed up for a section with only 2 people on the waitlist. After seeing our classmates struggle over the years with getting the classes they need, we decided on a solution of transparency that would let everyone share with each other the sizes of all the waitlists they are on, ultimately enabling them to make an informed decision.

Our image data was sorted into 6 categories — potholes, graffiti, broken sidewalks, signs covered by trees, broken traffic signs, or littering — after we uploaded our dataset to the Google Cloud Console.  Through the use of Google’s Cloud AutoML Machine Learning system, we developed a deep learning Neural Network Image Classifier that identified images and placed them into one of our five categories with an average precision of 0.981.  Additionally, the frequency of false positives generated by our model was 5.00%, and the frequency of false negatives was 9.52%. Prior to using Google’s Cloud AutoML, we experimented with Apple’s CreateML to develop models for our image classification system.  While CreateML served as a useful placeholder, we experienced difficulties in achieving a high enough level of image identification precision with this software.  After we managed to get AutoML working, we replaced CreateML with AutoML and our app’s functionality increased significantly.After creating a working machine learning model, we focused on the app development aspect of our project.  We originally attempt to develop both Android and Ios versions of our app, but we eventually decided to just focus on Ios.  We intend to develop an Android app after the completion of HackDuke, since we intend to eventually place our product on the app store.  We developed a basic UI to allow the user to change the category of the maintenance request (for the rare cases when AutoML fails to classify the incident correctly).  Following that, the user is asked 2-3 additional questions about the event.  These questions come from the City of Durham website. Lastly, the information about the incident is emailed to the correct person within the City of Durham maintenance department, along with the address of the incident and the photo of it.ChallengesInitially, we used Apple’s Create ML app to develop a machine learning model that would predict the type of environmental issue we categorized based on Durham One Call’s form.  CreateML was unable to create a model for us that was precise enough for our needs, and often misidentified maintenance incidents even after extensive training.  We solved this challenge through the use of Google’s AutoML system instead. We were really excited that our neural network was fully functioning after training for two hours. However, we believe that if our data set had provided a more extensive and accurate depiction of all of our categories, we could develop a significantly more accurate Neural Network Image Classifier.  Unfortunately, due to the time constraints and lack of a data set which we were faced with, we were unable to achieve a more accurate machine learning program within 24 hours.Another challenge we faced was developing the app from Android, since, none of us had any Android App Development experience.  We were unable to overcome this challenge in the allotted time, and so we instead decided to focus solely on developing an IOS app.What's nextMoving forward, we would like to get QuickReport to work with the Durham One Call website. Furthermore, we plan on developing our app to address environmental and maintenance issues in other locations in North Carolina (e.g. Raleigh) as well as around the world. For instance, Raleigh also has a convoluted online request form for resolving street issues that must be filled out by a user.

"", 'We used python2 and python3 with getOldTweets to pull the Twitter post information, Google Sentiment Analysis API to generate sentiment information.For the data analysis, Jupyter Notebook was used in conjunction with Java Swing to help visualize these plot in an clean GUI fashion. ', 'Twitter Analysis:Initially, we wanted to use Tweepy to pull relevant tweets of specific locations and date ranges because of previous experience in using it. Assigning locations was a bit odd: rather than taking in a location by keyword as a string (ex: ""Melbourne""), Tweepy actually requires the input of the top left and bottom coordinates of corners of a geographical box selection of that location. Pulling from the Google Maps Places API, we were able to pull this information. We then realized that Tweepy strictly pulls from the most recent tweets... there was no way to access past posts. We then decided to pivot and try to use Twitter\'s official API, until we learned Twitter\'s API has specific regulations on accessing tweets only within the past two weeks.With some in-depth Google Searches, we found a script on GitHub called getOldTweets that pulled historical Tweets using a unique method. Unfortunately, the update of the code from python2 to python3 was incomplete, thus while  location searching was available, date range queries weren\'t. However, both features still existed in the python2 version of the code. We decided to just write and run this scraping of the Twitter posts in python2, and write everything else in python3.Another challenge was that we are both computer science majors who did not have much experience in data analysis. Dealing with huge datasets in the hundreds-of-thousands was new territory to us, and it truly taught us a lot about how to deal with data. For example, we found that many entries of the data had to be discarded due to being unreasonable outliers or sparse entries. We also had to implement an efficient algorithm that could process all of this data in a reasonable time, which was done with a bit of dynamic programming in addition to concurrent processing to speed up our dataset retrieval. In addition, we had to figure out how to implement a Java GUI to show all of our data plots, so getting Java and Python to interface together was an interesting challenge.

"DrinkSafely","Alcohol poisoning is a rampant problem across America. Our wearable aims to keep users safe by helping them pace drinks and water, by counting drinks, and by being able to contact emergency services.","[2842, 'We were initially inspired because we saw a problem in our own Duke Community. So many of our peers and even our friends overdose on alcohol and require emergency services. Every weekend, and even many weekdays, we see several ambulances going to pick up another student with alcohol poisoning. This is not only a problem at Duke, but a widespread epidemic at Colleges throughout the U.S. Every year, more than 1500 students die from an alcohol overdose. For our project, we wanted to create something to combat that stunning statistic. Thus our idea to bridge into alcohol safety was born.What it DoesOur project is a wearable that counts the amount of drinks you’ve taken, reminds you to hydrate, times when you can have another drink, and gives you an easy way to contact an emergency number if something went wrong. Specifically, our wearable has a RGB LED light and a piezoelectric sensor. On a timer, the LED lights up blue and sends the user a text reminder about drinking water. Similarly, the wearable times how long between drinks and tells the user when it is ok to drink again, to allow the user to pace themselves throughout the night. Our wearable counts the amount of drinks by the person double tapping on the sensor. Finally, our wearable will contact an emergency number, when the person triple taps the sensor. How We Built ItFirst, we tried to build the project on a Particle Photon board. We were unable to flash code on this device, so we ended up switching to an Arduino. We uploaded firmata code on the Arduino. Firmata allows a python program on a laptop to control and read pins on the Arduino. We then wrote a python program that reads sensor values and sends SMS messages to a specific phone number. Finally, we soldered a circuit that includes the piezoelectric sensor and an RGB LED to a protoboard and protoshield. What We LearnedWe mainly learned the basics of hardware prototyping. We had to program an Arduino and wire up a LED and sensor circuit. We also learned how to design and solder a custom protoboard. We had to make sure it was durable so we hot glued all the connections. After this project, we feel more equipped to try more electronics prototyping in the future. Challenges We FacedWe initially wanted to use a Particle Photon board to read sensor input and send out SMS messages. Unfortunately, we had a lot of trouble setting up the board. Despite hours of troubleshooting, we could not flash code onto the board. In the end, we decided to work with an Arduino instead. We were able to restructure code and upload code onto this microcontroller which solved our previous issue.

"Teeter Toddler","Worried about leaving your child with a sitter? You may have cameras, but can't they see everything. Teeter Toddler is a small device that takes real-time data capable of sensing if your child is safe","[7437, ""What inspired us the most during our stay here at WHACK, was the drive to push ourselves into doing a project outside our skill set . What we decided to do as a team was, find an issue in today's world we could make a difference in by creating something in the allotted 32 hours. It was then that our idea sparked. A device that could track the safety of your child and alert you of possible harmful or dangerous situations your child may face while you're away from them, thus creation a sense of relief for said parent/parents. Most importantly increasing the safety of young children and newly born infants. "", ""Our project begins with a Texas Instruments CC2541 Sensor Tag. The sensor tag is then sewn into a baby's onesie or if the child is older, could also be attached to the exterior of their clothing. The CC2541 has the capability to collect IR Temperature, Ambient Temperature, Proximity, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Simple Keys, Humidity, Barometer, and Magnetometer data real time. For our project we focused on the Accelerometer, Gyroscope, and Ambient Temperature data that was being collected. The application Teeter Toddler does the rest, monitoring the data collected for any abnormalities or sudden changes in the babies movement which may indicate poor handling of the child, which may place the child in danger (Shaken Baby Syndrome). If the sensor detects such data, it immediately sends an audible notification alarm to the user informing them of the situation. The same is done with the Ambient Temperature data collected, if the baby is in a possible harmfully cold or hot environment, the user receives a notification to check on them. For temperature data, it is constantly being displayed to the user via the app. As the temperature falls or raises the app begins to alert the user via notifications, unless the temperature hits a dangers level and then the application sends an audible alarm. The goal here was to provided parents with protection and a sense of ease that their children are well taken care of in their absence in real time. That's not all, at first we look at this solution as a way to monitor others who look after our children but then came to a realization. The application could also be used in other ways, for instants. With the data being collected in real time, a new mother/father could use this same application to ensure safe handling of their child in their own hands. Also a growing problem we noticed in the news is the amount of cases where parents, perhaps due to stress or other factors, forget their children in the car during hazardous conditions. Teeter Toddler could be the determining factor in those precious few minutes of life or death, all with a simple yet accurate notification alert. With the Gyroscope and temperature data collected we could help prevent some of the top leading sleep environmental factors leading to Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Factors like the infant sleeping on their stomach or side. Babies placed in these positions to sleep might have more difficulty breathing than those placed on their backs, with the Gyroscope data we can help further prevent this. Another example is overheating, being too warm while sleeping can increase a baby's risk of SIDS. With both Ambient Temperature and IR temperature at our disposal, we could lower the number of cases reported with a simple app. "", 'The CC2541 is a power-optimized true system-on-chip (SoC) solution for both Bluetooth low energy and proprietary 2.4-GHz applications. It enables robust network nodes to be built with low total bill-of-material costs. The CC2541 combines the excellent performance of a leading RF transceiver with an industry-standard enhanced 8051 MCU, in-system programmable flash memory, 8-KB RAM, and many other powerful supporting features and peripherals. We also experimented with other microcontrollers, but in order to keep it small enough to not be bothersome to the child and still big enough not to be a choking hazard we stuck with the CC2541. Once attached, the CC2541 begins to collect real time data and passes it along into our application. The application side was developed within Evothings Studios and Workbench. This allowed us to create an application capable to run in both Android and Apple Operating Systems using JavaScript and HTML. Libraries such as Easyble.js and Tisensortag.js played an instrumental role in our final product. ', 'With a collective of very little experience in hardware and application development, getting started was a lot hard than we first envisioned. Nevertheless we had a goal in mind and worked as a team to further strengthen ourselves more into the subject we knew could use some polishing. Documentation on the TI CC2541 sensor tag was difficult to find since the company has since released newer versions of the sensor tag. This made it particularly difficult for us to properly extract the information we needed, but with some heavy duty digging we were able to find what we needed to make it all come together. ', ""Since we are Cyber Security students, we normally only focus on cyber security related projects  Yet instead we took what was said at opening ceremony to heart and decided to try something new to all of us.Finding a real world problem and solving it with something we made. To come out of all of that after 32 hours of not sleeping with a working prototype couldn't make our team any prouder. "", ""Asking what we didn't learn would be a smaller response. Even though 32 hours doesn't seem like a long time, one can definitely feel it. Practically every piece required to make our project work, meant a team member/members stopping what they were doing to do an hour or two of research to continue to stride forward towards the finish line. The most valuable thing we learned this weekend is that just because we know how to find exploit and vulnerabilities in things like apps and hardware components. It is a totally different prospective in building them that requires additional knowledge. "", 'Our team has decided to continue with this project after WHACK.

"BitWise","Anyone can help label complex datasets with our 20 questions like app and make money in the process.","[5522, 'Datasets for machine learning like ImageNet have created so much value and are an incredibly important part of the future. However, barely anyone can help label them. With over a thousand classes, even excluding the prevalence of very specific nouns and species of animals like birds, the task of knowing every class in such a large dataset is incredibly hard. We wanted to improve this and allow anyone to help researchers and companies label datasets while making a little money in the process.  ', 'Instead of requiring people to learn the intricacies of image datasets, we propose treating image labeling like a game of 20 (or N) questions. Users are tasked with answering the same binary question for groups of images of the same decision node. As users answer these questions, images are propagated further down the tree iteratively until they are classified. Users gain points for each image they classify and can redeem these in the future for gift cards. There are multiple advantages for this solution. By giving users much of the same mental task in a row, people don’t have to constantly shift their attention to different classification tasks and can therefore work more efficiently and have greater accuracy. One challenge arises in this solution: how do you produce binary questions at scale for a very large, specific dataset? For this, we use WordNet, a NLP dataset that encodes the hyponyms and hypernyms (supersets and subsets of words) in a tree. Since any tree can be binarized, we can create a new question set for almost any dataset instantly. We can use a Least Common Ancestor algorithm to find the lowest common branch of the tree for all needed categories and shake the tree to decrease the number of classifications needed per image.With BitWise, we can significantly increase the number of people who can help label datasets and do it at a greater speed than ever before. People can also make money in an ethical and equitable way in the process. ', 'Our backend is built with a REST API in Flask connected to a MongoDB database in Python. One of the advantages of using a non-relational database like MongoDB is that we can represent our database like an actual tree. We calculate the tree structure using WordNet, a dataset that maps the semantic field relationships (supersets and subsets of words) between words in a tree-like structure, binarizing the tree. We implemented a custom scheduler to navigate the tree and find the next best images a user should classify. We also host our static images on-server. Currently, our app is configured to use a subset of ImageNet called TinyImageNet. However, this is easily configurable. This is all deployed on Google Cloud.Our frontend is a React Native app compiled with the Expo toolchain, written in Javascript. The app sends a GET request to our API to get new image URLs, IDs and categories to classify from our scheduler, and sends a POST request back for each image classified with an image id and a boolean. The database is updated in real-time and can support simultaneous users as well as users exiting the app and never classifying images.

This inspired us to create Clip It, a tool that can programmatically create highlight reels of Twitch streams in a matter of seconds. ', ""Clip It allows you to find the highlights of your favorite streams. Given the URL for a video, it finds the highlights by tracking two key metrics:1) Local spikes in chat message frequency (i.e. the equivalent of volume level in Twitch chat). We keep a rolling median of the number of messages sent in consecutive 30-second windows; and window that is significantly higher than the local median could be of interest!2) Sentiment magnitude of the chat messages. To detect this, we used Google Cloud Platform's natural language processing-based sentiment analysis API, which returns sentiment score (i.e. positive or negative) and sentiment magnitude (how positive or negative). We focused on just sentiment magnitude, as that will pick out an interesting and wide variety of events, from controversial to exciting moments! Once again, we track local spikes in sentiment magnitude compared to the rolling median to find clips of interest.We then look at the product of the differences between each metric and its rolling median--the clips with the highest value for this number therefore have large spike in both metrics. We return the timestamps with the highest values to make our highlight reel!

In rural areas, finding the nearest charging station can be very difficult, and may put off potential electric vehicle (EV) owners. In order to solve this problem, we decided to create a utility to help users find and map the closest EV charging station dynamically, based on the charge of the EV and projected route. If we can solve this commonplace issue among prospective buyers, we can encourage more people to buy EVs, thereby reducing global emissions and improving the carbon footprint on the environment.

First we check if it's weekend and then divide the time into AM and PM and check what they're doing at that time and whether to call or not. we put the result into variable suggest.

For analyzing data part, we have tons of if statements to deal with. (eg. check if it's bed time, lunch time, work time and etc.) However, it's impossible for us to put every time in the condition. We try to convert the time to integer and then use > or < to find a time range, but it fails since time (eg. 11:30) cannot be converted into 32 integer. And then we try to convert time to string variable and compare strings. But it fails since for 1:00,  the second character is ':', but for 11:00, the second character is  '1'; ascii of '1' will be definitely smaller than ':', so it will show us that '1:00'>'11:00'. Finally we figure out this by using time.Contains(), and we made it! "", 'We work out a time schedule for the person we want to call very specifically. We take consideration whether it is weekdays or weekend and even when ""they\'re on their way to work"" or ""they\'re on their way home"".

"Biasd","Allowing users to learn more about twitter -- and themselves.","[4437, 'Politics, especially partisan politics, have reemerged in the news in recent times. From the democratic primaries to the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, the public is being flooded with new information. One of the largest sources of this information is Twitter, which is also the preferred form of communication for President Donald Trump. So, we wanted to do something to better understand the information stream of twitter, and we immediately thought of replicating the tweets are a way to discern, as an information consumer, what is false and what is true.  ', 'Our creation allows users to understand their inherent bias, as well as the leanings of twitter. It is a novel way for users to understand the queries that they otherwise would just enter into the search bar of Twitter. Ultimately, Bias allows readers to understand Twitter-and themselves. The user is prompted to enter search queries, from which results are pulled and fake data created. The user then enters this game-like scenario in which they have to choose whether or the tweet is real. In the end, the user is shown a comparison of the sentiment of their favored tweets, as well as the liberal and conservative leanings, as compared with their choices. In the end, they also receive an accuracy score of how accurate they were at discerning what is right and what is wrong.  ', 'The application itself is built on Flask and then hosted locally. The user search query is passed to the Twitter API, from which tweets containing the word are selected. From this corpus of relevant tweets, Markov chaining is used to generate semantically similar tweets. The output is displayed using Charts.js and presented to the user.  ', 'For us, the largest challenge was the segmentation of what we were trying to do. We knew that together, the various parts of the creation (from the fake tweets to the sentiment analysis) would be technically impressive but from a social perspective, meaningless. We knew that each part we could reasonably get running, but we wanted to create a cohesive end product that included all of these parts to best represent how inherent bias affects the understanding of how Twitter information is perceived. ', 'We are most proud of the integrative system and the game-like mechanism for comparison. We think that asking the user to label tweets would have been boring, and taken away from the individual accuracy of some of the fake tweets. So, we wanted to highlight not just the individual tweets but also the aggregation of the data that gives insight into the user, and having this two-page system allows for that. We are also very happy with the believability of these fake tweets, which surprised us after running the Markov chain generator multiple times. This is especially impressive considering the fact that we had to handle hashtags and mentions, which are very common on Twitter. ', ' ', 'The next step for Bias will be to expand the features that we can glean from the information we get. In keeping to a Twitter base, we can also get information about the other types of political parties, such as libertarians or socialists. We don’t want to characterize information as either liberal or conservative, as this is a dichotomy that we hope to break and also inherently part of our bias as developers. We’d also potentially want to expand beyond the Twitter corpus and move to other text-based systems such as Reddit, for example. And of course, we’d like to put this out on the web, where everyone can enjoy it, not just us!

"Prism","Inspired by Pink Floyd's ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" album cover, an effect that explores harmony and chaos in light and sound. The bright and dark side of the moon.","[3898, 'We\'ve been inspired by the Pink Floyd\'s ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" album cover, which shows light going through a prism and then dispersing into individual frequencies. It can be interpreted as a difficulty in understanding the complexity of the world when all factors blend in together (the dark side), while each of them making sense individually (the bright side).Our idea was to make the phone be the prism, and represent the prism\'s ""dark"" and ""bright"" sides with the face and world lenses respectively, letting the user switch between them. Both light and sound are waves, so we immediately thought about representing the light frequencies as sounds. We based the light-audio associations on chromotherapy, so that each colour represents a mood not only visually but also with regards to the sound. ', 'The user starts in the world lens. They can see colourful light rays converging where they hold their phone (at the phone\'s screen). Looking around, they explore therapeutic sounds associated with each light colour individually. The user can then switch to the face lens (the other side of the prism, i.e. the dark side of the moon), where the individual light frequencies from the other side converge into white light, while the previously soothing and energising sounds blend into an unsettling and ""incomprehensible"" unity. The user\'s face is also treated in black and white has a dark styling applied to it. ', ""We've used SparkAR Studio to build the effect. Development was done using JavaScript with Webpack and Babel to facilitate multi-file coding (helpful for collaboration during the hackathon). The world lens effect uses world coordinates to position the light rays around the user, while the face lens uses background segmentation, face tracker and shaders to achieve the desired styling. "", ""Initially the concept for the world lens was to rely on plane tracking and have all the light rays follow the phone (the prism), automatically rotating towards it and adjusting the light rays so they always reach the phone. We've spent a large amount of time and got this working perfectly fine in Spark AR Studio, but the behaviour when testing on an actual device was broken. We have chatted with the Spark AR team and couldn't find a solution to the problem, concluding that it might be a bug or some set of features that are disabled on the device.We've also faced issues with sound playback on the device, which, after a long debugging session, appeared to be an issue of file format (m4u) and replacing them with .wav's solved the issue.

","[3553, 'A lot of adults struggle with persistent feelings of self-doubt, which often stem from experiences in childhood. We also realized the potential of mixed reality to engage with a diverse audience all over the world; however, we also wanted to create something that was accessible. Since many people now have smartphones, we decided to create a therapeutic tool with augmented reality (AR) that is accessible across the world (in contrast to virtual reality that still has a high barrier of entry due to cost).  ', 'Pocket Grow is an AR mobile application that supports the expression of positive affirmation in children ages 5 to 9. This is a critical period in children’s identity development, according to a developmental psychologist, Eric Erickson. The application starts with a breathing exercise that puts the child in the mindset to begin thinking about positive affirmations. This is achieved by a virtual agent that is projected onto the physical space (i.e. augmented onto the physical space) and facilitates the breathing exercise. Children are then encouraged to say positive things about themselves, and the more things they say, the more flowers and other plants grow around them.  ', ""Using Unity as the main engine, we utilized Google's ARCore SDK for Android devices in augmenting the virtual objects onto the physical space. For detecting and analyzing the user's speech, we used IBM Watson's Speech-to-Text, Tone Analyzer, and Text-To-Speech Unity SDKs. For quick prototyping, we used Procreate, Photoshop, Premier.  "", ""None of us have used Unity or any sort of mixed reality/3D game development before. Additionally, we had originally planned to use Google's DialogFlow instead of IBM Watson, since we were already using their ARCore SDK. However, Google had deprecated and shut down their previous version 2 months ago, and there are no longer any Unity plugins for DialogFlow. We then had to shift gears and look for a new NLP tool, and since we had also not used IBM Watson with Unity before, this was also a learning curve.

"Dermax","DerMax is a personal AI skincare disease assistant, which can help patients self-diagnose skin disease and connect the best dermatologists in their vicinity. ","[5452, ""Skin cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the US, and other parts of the world alike, though most cases are preventable. The number of people diagnosed with skin cancer in the last three decades is higher than all previous decades combined, and that number is still increasing. $8.1 million dollars a year goes to skin cancer treatment, with $3.3 million alone attribute to melanoma. The ratio of dermatologists vs patients with skin diseases some of the third world countries is 1:6700. Thus, it becomes challenging for patients to find dermatologists and bear a huge financial burden for themselves, their families and substantial healthcare costs for the nation's economy. Earlier diagnosis can prevent patients from missing the best time of treatments, hence can reduce the costs of treatment and avoid complications. It can also be a powerful tool in helping doctors to make a faster, more reliable and more efficient diagnosis of the diseases. We see great potential in technologies like artificial intelligence with various applications in the healthcare industry, which in turn inspires us to use it for solving skin disease prediction problems, to make this world a better place for everyone. In this hackathon, we have developed ‘DerMax’, a personal skincare assistant.  "", 'Our proposed product, ‘DerMax’, is a personal skincare assistant that can be used to check if one has any skin disease and by dermatologists, providing an extra hand/brain to create a faster diagnosis of skin diseases. We have created a basic website, on which a patient suspected to have some skin disease, can upload a picture of the affected skin region, and at the backend, our image classifier classifies into one of the 10 possible skin diseases. The website then generates a result that shows the probability of the patient having one of the 10 diseases. If the model predicts a high probability of particular skin disease, we plan to direct the patients to one of the best dermatologists in his/her vicinity, decided by a PageRank-like algorithm and can be visualized on the google maps, which is integrated into our website.  ', 'We got an open-source dataset for Skin cancer MNIST dataset from Kaggle, which classifies skin lesion images into either cancerous of skin-disease category. We trained a Resnet 50 classifier on 10,000 images (without data augmentation) and 40,000 images (with data augmentation - flip, mirror, grayscale images, etc.) and classified it into 10 different skin disease classes. We used the pre-trained weights of ResNet50 from the ImageNet dataset and did transfer learning by learning the weights of the final layer. The best accuracy that we received on the validation set was 78.2% while training the model for 50 epochs. We plan to improve on this model’s accuracy by taking the following steps: ', 'We faced many difficulties while working on this. Firstly, it was a little difficult to get an open-source dataset from the internet, and after searching for a long time, we got a dataset on SKIN CANCER MNIST from Kaggle. Secondly, it was to identify the right model architecture, which could potentially learn the subtle features that differentiate one skin-disease from others. While training the network, tuning the hyperparameters, like the number of neurons in the final layer, learning rate, dropout probabilities, etc. took a substantial amount of our time. Combining machine learning pipeline to the website without compromising any features is one of the tough ones, as we didn’t stop to just make a mock-up but wanted to complete it as a whole.

Specifically, it assigns a monetary value to each chore and based on some cycle length and deadline agreed upon by the house, the app will randomly assign the chores to the members of the house. At the beginning of each cycle, house members are charged for the cost their assigned chores are worth. Then, each member has until the chores' specified deadline to complete the chore or they risk losing the money they were charged. In the event they complete it on time, they will receive the corresponding amount back, however, in the event that the chore remains incomplete, it becomes available for others to take on and win the amount the chore is worth. Moreover, House Rules provides a feature for compensating those who incurred significant hardships in their living situation, separate from recurring chores, such as cleaning up after a party or utility maintenance.

","[4459, 'According to research statistics, 80% of students report that they feel stress on a daily basis and 40% of them don’t actively seek help. The response we get when we are seeking emotional support is often “Sorry, I don’t understand.” or “I’m sorry to hear that.” and this hasn’t changed for many years (at least from 2017). Because smartphones and its built-in voice assistant become prevalent these days, we want to create a pocket therapist that offers immediate emotional support whenever and wherever people are. ', 'The Pocket Counselor project is an add-on to the default voice assistant software that provides more human responses to help students deal with stress at school. Imagine talking to Siri/Google Assistant about how stressful you are during midterms and instead of hearing “Sorry, I don’t understand.”, they reply to you with “Take some time and go over all the topics you don’t understand. You can do it!” We have trained the voice assistant to recognize and offer different responses to problems related to schoolwork, friends, family, suicidal tendencies, and negative emotions such as sadness, frustration, stress, and depression, etc. ', 'We built this prototype through the developer platform Actions on Google for Google Assistant. With hours of research into common problems students face, we put at least 5 example phrases as Machine Learning training data for the agent for each intent we have covered. The intents include SchoolPorblem, FamilyProblem, JobProbelm, RelationshipProblem, ImposterSyndrome, LifeSaver, Encouragement, Appreciation, etc. We also provided at least 5 example responses the agent can reply to each intent. During our testing stage, we are able to do live demo through any phones with Google Assistant installed and developer accounted linked. ', 'Feasibility: Our original idea is to make the voice assistant recognize whether user has potential symptoms of mental illness and then provide real-time assistance 24/7. If a user demonstrates severe mental stress or depression, the voice assistant will then seamlessly connect a counselor with the user during the conversion. However, this idea is hard to achieve in reality. Since this service is available for users at any time, it might be difficult to connect users with a counselor at midnight, which involves certain operational costs that cannot be avoided.Training data: Currently, we manually typed in possible conversations between a student with potential mental illness symptoms and the voice assistant. Since it is not a comprehensive dataset, there are use cases that we did not include. For this to be said, our current outcome provides a solid framework that combines counseling feature with voice assistant.User Utterance:How to understand user utterance in a broader context of the dialogue is the main challenge while developing the add-on counseling feature of Google Assistant. In Google Assistant’s developer platform, we can add parameters such as dates, times, and places that define which parts of the user utterances to extract. However, Google Assistant does not allow us to create parameters related to user’s emotions such as sadness, anger, and depression, which can largely improve its ability to identify user’s intentions behind his or her move (e.g. asking a question or making a complaint). ', 'Built human-like voice assistant with better user experienceCreated potential benefits to students and their communitiesLearned research statistics related to mental health and how technology can help ', 'Prototyping is fun, although we faced many problems.

So far, the school has done a really good job: reduced electricity use by 16% and thermal energy by 13%. The school has been doing a great job so far, but as members of the community, we wonder: can we contribute to the process as individuals? Thus, our group came up with the idea to develop an App to help the students and faculties to participate in the mission and contribute their own effort.  ', ""It learns the user's long-term food preferences and recommends similar foods according to health-factors and eco-factors. The app can increase the usage frequency by giving feedbacks to users' food consumption, their daily carbon footprint and build a community. Here is the interaction procedure:In this part, we include a complete interaction process, including two parts. Environmental behavioural theory Theory of reasoned action (TRA) and theory of planned behaviour (TPB) are common theories used to investigate the factors associated with an individual’s environmental behaviours.Persuasive technology refers to an interactive product that is designed to evaluate changes in attitudes, behaviours and their interactionsThe first part is a pre-survey for first time users, we use environmental behavioral questions and carbon footprint awareness questionnaire (See Appendix 1) to generate personalized eco-friendly scores that’s based on the average carbon footprint of the Moho community. A five-point Likert scale ranging from one to five is used to score responses to each item in the constructs. Each item is constructed according to the national mean and standard deviation. There are two types of questions: a),behavioral questions: “On average, how long does it take you to take a shower? 1, less than 3 mins    2, 3-6 mins    3, 6-9 mins   4, 9-12 mins   5, 12 mins and aboveWe will score this question reversely, add 1 to the total score if the user select ‘12 mins and above. ’b) carbon footprint awareness:“Global warming problems have consequences for my life.”1 Strongly Disagree  2 Disagree 3 Neutral 4 Agree 5 Strongly AgreeWe will add 5 to the total score if the user select ‘Strongly Agree’The app will map the score to the distribution of all users’ scores and present a ranking.After the new user finished the first part, they will join the other users to the second part: Daily log and how to reduce your carbon footprint. It begins the long-term (stable) food preference elicitation. This is to collect what the user generally likes to eat. The user can browse a full catalog of recipes from Mount Holyoke College’s daily menu, and mark those that he/she has eaten or would like to eat that day. This is also the part where the user can specify their diet restrictions. In order to find food recommendations which both appeal the user’s appetite, help them to decrease their carbon dioxide emission and have balanced meals, an active learning technique, which is called User Utility Multidimensional Prediction, is used. We modify existing nutrient-based food recommender algorithm to include additional parameters that are used for modelling the dependencies between the environmental component and and the food preference and nutrition component.  "", 'Our first step is to calculate the average daily carbon footprint per capita. We scraped the numbers of annual water, electricity and fuel usage from the school website, multiply them by the carbon emission factor. There are approximately 2,335 students and 312 staff and faculties at Mount Holyoke last year, so we get the daily average carbon footprint per capita: 36012122.87/365/2647 = 37.27 ton/per day/ per personWe also want to take school’s recycling programs into consideration.

"EcoWarriors-A Social Game Challenge ","EcoWarriors-A Social Game Challenge To Bring Awareness and Action Toward Climate Change","[7149, ""We develop this project through our very personal experience. We deeply care about our environment. However, when we talk to our friends about the impact of climate change, they just feel like another lecture from Mr. or Ms. Environmentalist. They don't care about the topic because they feel like climate change is a big global issue and they can't do anything to change that. Moreover, many of my friends think climate change is just a scientific myth and they don't see any real impact of it in their daily lives. Therefore, through this Climathon, we get together as a team to develop a game app that can visually show the real impact of climate change and how the players can actually change the effect of it through daily activities. Project Description:My team develop a game called “EcoWarriors” to raise awareness about climate change.  Our goal is to help people change their daily habits and adopt a more sustainable lifestyle. Every action of the users will be tracked and converted to score, that score will be the metrics for the wellbeing of their virtual pet. These actions include: Reducing carbon footprint, Using more renewable energy, wasting Less water, reducing waste ( i.e. Changing to reusable shopping bags), choosing businesses that support green living (partners), recycling, walking instead of drivingGame Storyline:The global climate change becomes a huge problem on Earth and many animals are on the edge of extinction. To prevent the mass extinction from happening, the players will act as a wild-lives rescuers and each of them are assigned with a mysterious egg of an endangered animal. Each animal they are assigned will be the very last one of a species. The players will incubate each egg at the beginning stage of the game. After the players reach a certain score, the egg will reveal their assigned animal ( i.e. penguin, dolphin, whale, polar bear…) Depending on the player’s choice of challenge, a set of tasks will be shown. The tasks are daily action in a person’s life, and every completed task be tracked and converted to score. That score will be the metrics (such as air quality, water quality, energy consumption…) will contribute to the wellbeing of their virtual pet and the improvement of the environment in that animal’s habitat. With higher score level, the virtual animals will slowly bear more eggs and have a family of their own to bring their species out of extinction.  This game raise people’s awareness and educate us about the different sustainable in a friendly and fun way that even a kid can understand. This game is great for individuals or the whole family together. Methods for Score Tracking:Take photos of their electric bills, track decreaseShow receipts of restaurants/businessesTrack geolocation for milage of a person when they are walking or biking.Timing showers and water usageGreen membership card to use on bus or partnered green stores/restaurant/coffee shop/markets. Members with this cards can get discounted at those partnered store, too.Reward for Players:Creating “Badges” for each challenge (i.e. Reducing Plastic Waste)Every month, the community of this game will get together to celebrate the top scored players and listen to their journey of changing their daily habits toward a sustainable living goals. This will help fuel up the motivation of the players and build a stronger community full of exciting environmentally-mindful individual.Data Gathering & Visualization:Summarizing the statistic of average consumption of water and energy on a local-level. Training algorithm with real data to perfect our scoring system. Gathering data about local businesses and markets about their level of green-awareness. Using this data to improve users’ experience and connecting them with the right community partners and organizations which promote the sustainable and green living. Impact of Solutions:This game raise people’s awareness and educate us about the different sustainable in a friendly and fun way that even a kid can understand. This game is great for individuals or the whole family together. Therefore, even the ones who are not so interested in environmental issues before will start to be mindful about it through this game. Our ultimate goal is to raise people’s awareness on the topic of climate change and to motivate community to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle via this gamification project.Future Plan:We are developing the app and working on launching our beta version through limited invitation. Then, when we are confident with our final product, we will launch the official version on the app store and then working on promoting the app through advertising and words-of-mouth. When we have a good initial users base, we will work on building a bigger community. Every month, the community of this game will get together to celebrate the top scored players and listen to their journey of changing their daily habits toward a sustainable living goals. This will help fuel up the motivation of the players and build a stronger community full of exciting environmentally-mindful individual.On the data science side of this project, we will work on:Summarizing the statistic of average consumption of water and energy on a local-level.

"Puzzle of the Day","A daily crossword puzzle game - designed from the ground up only for Alexa","[10809, 'I\'ve always been interested in building games for voice, as voice is such a different medium than the visual ones we are bombarded with throughout the rest of our day. Voice games are a perfect time to sit back, use your imagination, and really immerse yourself in something, similar to reading a book. It activates your brain in ways you don\'t get from your phone, your TV, your consoles, or your computer.I\'ve built games for Alexa in the past, but for this competition I wanted to focus on something specific, and that was retention. Generally most voice games don\'y have great retention - you play it once, finish the content within a week or so, and you\'re over it. While that can provide for an engaging experience, it\'s not always the best path forward for something like ISP. To make some income, you really want people coming back time and time again.Despite the rise of technology in our day to day, and the decline of traditional newspapers, there is still a massive community of crossworld puzzlers around the globe. People still keep their subscriptions solely for the daily crossword. Crossword puzzles and their fun clues are an amazing brainteaser, forcing you to think deeply about words and their meanings, learning and having fun at the same time. Voice seemed like the perfect medium to translate this sort of experience. Voice games are especially great for those ""in-between times"". It\'s something you can do when you wake up, when you are doing the dishes, doing the laundry, driving etc. You may be doing something mindless with your hands, but still want to engage with your brain. These were the times of day I wanted to target.With an idea in mind, I set to work! ', ""Puzzle of the Day is a daily crossword puzzle style game. The puzzles are built from the ground up for Alexa, and are designed as quick 5-10 minute daily experiences.Each puzzle consists of five words, and a theme.It uses clues similar to those you may find in a crossword puzzle, but removes the crossing component from the game. Instead, solving words give you free 'letter reveals' which act in the same way, but you can be strategic about when to use them. If you are stumped on a hard word, you can pass and rack up some letter reveals to help you with that one later.Once the user guesses all five words, they can wager some points on the theme. Points are earned from solving words, having remaining letter reveals, as well as time bonus for finishing under 5, 10 and 15 minutes. You only get one guess for the theme, but guessing correctly with a high wager could let you double your points.Once solving each daily puzzle, you can see how your score compared to others around the world with an in game leaderboard, giving you your percentile and place for time and points for each day. Users who are more interested in the stats can link their accounts and access the online leaderboards that I built for the game. These are available at https://www.stokedskills.com/puzzleoftheday/You can also set up the email service to get a daily email at the end of the day, so you can see how you compared against all the users of the day (because when you play, you can only get stats for people who played thus far) "", ""There are a number of components to this skill:The skill code itself:I built this skill using the Jovo framework. It is developed in Node.js using typescript, and data for each user is being persisted to the skill in DynamoDb. The skill supports the APL interface and has full screen APL support across for all devices, throughout the whole game.The Leaderboards:The leaderboard data can be accessed within the skill, from the website, or from the email service. Leaderboard data is updated whenever a user finishes a puzzle, and is stored in and AWS RDS MySql instance.The Website:The website allows users to view their rankings on a 7 day / Last Month / All time basis. You can look up your user and see your scores for each puzzle you completed. This out of skill component was designed and built to help with user retention. It's built as a static site hosted and Amazon S3, written with javascript in VueJS. Data is accessed via a backend node API hosted in AWS Lambda and API Gateway using the serverless framework. The Email Service:To send emails to users, there is a recurring job each day.  Once a day is completed and we have everyone's scores, we can publish that days results. Using an AWS lambda running on a cron schedule daily, we load up all the scores from the database for the previous day for users that have requested emails. For those users, we calculate their individual stats for percentile and place in time and points and deliver it as an email using Twilio's SendGrid. This system was an integral part of the design as I really wanted to focus on user retention to drive adoption of the ISP.The ISP: For the In Skill Purchase component of the skill, I decided to go with subscriptions. Since I was focused on retention and daily usage, I figured that a recurring model would be the best approach for this skill. I've decided to brand the ISP as the puzzle league, and by subscribing users get extra benefits like more games, and the ability to reveal extra letters. The free component to the game is substantial, but by paying a small monthly fee, those dedicated users can get some extra enjoyment and fun. "", ""Because I wanted to build a game of high quality, I included alot of features which increased the scope. Besides the skill itself, I needed to build out the website, the database system for the in-skill leaderboards, and email system, and a content management framework. While building the skill itself, and all the other moving parts were quite a challenge and took lots of iteration to get right, I think the content management aspect was the most interesting challenge I had to face so I wanted to focus on that.Building a daily recurring game means more content every day. To make this word right and with accurate word recognition, I needed to include all of the solutions to the puzzles, including the themes, into the voice model. This means re-certifying with every new puzzle that is added. I could have taken a more risky approach and used an 'open' slot with SearchQuery, but I really wanted the accuracy to be top notch so I took the more involved approach.To get all the data into the skill, I needed a great way to manage the content. Instead of managing the puzzle content in code, I decided it would be way easier to use spreadsheets. In the spreadsheet I can fill in the solutions, the clues, and the themes.From there, I needed to get it into the slots of the skill, and access it from within my skill code. To do so, I built a number of deployment scripts. These scripts are used to do a number of things:Import the spreadsheet into code and convert it into JSON, so the skill code can use it to provide the right puzzlesAutomatically fill in dates and data for all the new puzzles that are addedRun some verification on the generated JSON file to make sure there are no duplicate dates, puzzleIds, etcTake all the words I need from the JSON file in the voice model, (clue answers and theme names) and open up the voice model json file, update the slot values, and save it back to disk so that I could use that to upload to the Alexa service.Upload all the puzzle data into MySql so the website has access to the correct puzzle dataThese scripts allow me to do all the data management I need in only a minute or so, saving me alot of time and potential errors in the future. With this system, I plan to create skill content every 2-3 months, and then update the skill with that data, giving me a nice worry-free window in case things are slow with certification. By automating the process, I can make all those above updates that are pretty far reaching into all of the infrastructure and code of the entire system, without touching the code myself. This really limits the vectors for failure and allows me to spend more of my time focusing on how to improve the game for customers. "", ""With all the moving parts, this was probably the most complicated and in depth skill I've built. It's the first one I've built using Subscriptions as an ISP. After spending alot of time on the design, and considering cutting alot of the scope, I'm proud that I completed everything I set out to do, and that I designed it in an efficient and scalable way that requires little maintenance. I'm excited to see how it performs now that its out there in the wild!  "", ""Skill development is an amazing learning process, and I learned a ton with this project. While I had experience with some of these technologies before, I took steps to learn and include more technologies whenever I got the chance. For example, as part of this project I learned Typescript and built the entire skill using it. Being my first time using Typescript, it took at bit of studying up, but I think it paid off in the end and my skill is far more maintainable that it would have been without it. I also learned the importance of user testing. As part of the process, I recruited people that I knew to act as beta testers and play through the game for a few weeks before the release. This really allowed me to tweak the difficulty and gameplay and find a level where I think people will gain the most possible enjoyment. As I went through a couple iterations of this I found that each and every piece of feedback I acted on had an immediate effect on the next group of people I had try the game. It's definitely a process that I will continue doing on future projects.  "", ""Now that I have everything set up and rolling, the next step is to iterate and improve the experience. Nothing is ever quite perfect on the first try, and that is why I set up a feedback system within the skill. Each day, users can rate the quality of the puzzle. This is stored into my database and I can use it to help me understand what is working and what isn't as I build more puzzles for the future.In addition, I want to iterate on the ISP. I want to find more ways to add value to subscribers with the potential for weekly challenge puzzles, or monthly competitions. I'd love to build out an A/B testing framework for this game so I can truly identify what is working and make smart analytical decisions about where to invest my time next.

"That's Obvious: A Trivial Dilemma","It's a fun trivia game... with a splash of drama!","[4754, ""I've been working on assistant-based programming for over 15 years now. Also back then, my partner Kelli and I came up with a road trip game that worked like a combination of 20 questions and a verbal crossword puzzle for famous people's names. The two passions have come together to create That's Obvious, and here we have the latest flavor: A Trivial Dilemma! "", ""Trivial Dilemma is a gameshow with 5 rounds. Each round has a secret famous name that the player(s) are trying to figure out. Each round starts off with an impossible clue and gives you more and more clues. Each clue makes it more obvious AND doubles the current pot (so even if you know the answer, you may want to hold out for more $$$). The player who gets the secret name wins the round's pot, and whoever has the most $$$ at the end of the game wins. BUT! Each round can pit a player with a moral dilemma, where she must make a tough decision between winning the game and winning friends. "", ""I started making Alexa Skills at the very beginning, and I developed my own Alexa Skills framework in TypeScript called ask-gib. It's evolved over the years, and this skill gave me the chance to include & test the ISP workflow. I have the build/deploy process as a single command in vscode, which builds, zips and deploys the skill to the AWS lambda function (the $LATEST alias). Then I made use of the Developer Console's awesome new Alexa Simulator and Voice & Tone tools, which have vastly sped up the debug cycle compared to testing on the physical device. I also used the console to create an ISP product, which was very straight-forward and well-documented. For debugging, I still have been using logging and CloudWatch, but I'm looking forward to incorporating the new client-side proxy for debugging locally.  "", 'Aside from the normal (tough) challenges of programming in general, my main challenge was in reconciling the pay-to-play aspect of In Skill Products and my desire to make it available and fully functional to those who are unable to afford any products. That\'s how I came up with the PayItForwardIntent invoked by ""Pay It Forward"". This sets a flag in code that indicates that all packs are available. When checking for available content, the code checks for entitled products or this flag.  So the skill works exactly as if the user paid for the product. When she is ready to support me, she can say ""Pay It Back"" which toggles the flag off and gives her the list of available products.This is actually why I\'ve kept away from ISP in the first place, but I think this is a good solution to the issue.  ', 'In addition to the above Pay It Forward solution (which I\'m most proud of!) and getting the skill working in general, I\'m also proud of the variety of speech involved with the skill. I am able to accomplish this with my lex-gib library, which works both as i18n and idiomatic alternatives. So in addition to having a single translation into other languages, this allows for multiple translations in multiple languages with single line of calling code. So in code I can write a single line calling for the ""bye"" speech (text and/or ssml), and depending on language/weighting and other options, I\'ll get speech like ""Bye"", ""Bye-Bye"", ""Later"", ""Ciao"", ""Arrivaderci"", ""Tschuss"", etc. In combination with other features of the library, this provides robust dynamism in the voice interaction. ', ""I've learned to use some of the new tools made available for testing Alexa Skills, as well as the nice ISP workflow. This includes how to create a product, how to get a list of products and entitlements for the user, how to form the ISP directive and give flow control over to the Alexa Service and how to resume control flow after a purchase is accepted/declined. "", 'There are always so many small improvements to make, but the main thing to do now is to create more free and ISP expansion content! Also I have ideas for when to prompt the user with an UPSELL and overall get more dynamic interaction with respect to available content and other updates. Ultimately an open-data expansion pack system to go along with the open-source skill itself would create the absolute best experience for the consumers. This way, those who are good at generating the trivia (and dramatic dilemmas!) can do their thing and those who are good at generating the code can do theirs...what an experience that could be!

But then I decided that adults can play it as well. That's how I've started working on the Capitalist Journey. "", ""As in a real world you get your 9 to 5 job, weekly payroll and you rent your apartment.Each turn in the game equals to one week, so you get your weekly payroll, once a month you need to pay your rent.You also can buy businesses and real estate properties, both ways can help you to generate an additional cashflow.  Obviously you need somehow to save money in order to buy these assets.You can make some money by flipping stuff online aka side hustle :)Sometimes some event can happen, for example it's your friend's birthday and you need to buy a gift. Or to pay taxes. You need to be prepared for such events as in real life. Each consecutive day of playing will give users an additional bonus.For those people who want to speed up the process, there are several premium packs available which give a boost to your bank account. "", 'Using Jovo Framework + Ruby/Rails API app + MySql ', ""The main challenge is to understand what could be interesting to people. And developing the game can be even more challenging in this area, cause, for the most part, you can't validate your assumptions  "", ""Couple times I was thinking that nobody will play it, I was considering switching to another ideas. So I'm glad that I've finished it. "", ""Don't underestimate who long will it take to develop even the MVP of the game.Check the invocation name before publishing the skill. I've used the 'empire builder' name and then realized that there is an existing skill with the same name. So I've removed the live skill and submitted another one with the new name.  "", ""First and foremost I want if it will be interesting for people.But if I assume that people will play the game, then there are many options how I can improve it. Some of the ideas: Scoreboard. Bring some competition to the game.Add more options how users could earn moneyDevelop some kind of 'reputation/status badges', so if you buy some large apartment, your status is increasing and your get more options after that.Make it more realistic and allow to take loans in order to buy business or property.

That is why our primary focus is to connect them to nearby businesses that will offer discounts and benefits to verifiable evacuees.

First, and most importantly, these companies can contribute to easing the financial and physical discomfort of victims. This is an opportunity for corporate benevolence and community involvement.

"Disaster Relief &amp; Recovery Application (DRRA)","Providing tools to both local government and residents are essential for properly handling a disaster, including analyzing large amounts of data and having resources to get what you need. ","[3345, ""After doing research on the biggest problems people face when it comes to natural disasters, I realized it could make a huge difference if people had the proper technological tools to handle the most common issues. I developed software that first responders and local governments can use to evaluate the impact of the disaster, and a phone application that residents can use to quickly see what's going on.  "", ""The Java software for first responders and local governments scrapes social media by hashtag or a list of residents, scans the images uploaded which can be sorted by date, uses AI to evaluate what's going on in the pictures, sends the data from Google Cloud Platform to MongoDB Atlas, and then sends the data to the java application to be viewed by the user.The phone application allows residents to see local news stories quickly, request items, request assistance, see if other neighbors are meeting up, and see who else needs help and if they can help themselves.  "", ""I used Java for the first responder software, Maven to use the MongoDB, Jackson and JSON repositories, and Google Cloud Platform and MongoDB to handle the movement of the scraped images and AI scanned data in the cloud.I used Xcode and Swift to make the phone application, which uses Google Firebase for a login system (logging in isn't required but helpful), and has a Feed, Assistance, Meetings and Settings pages. I used CocoaPods to use Firebase in the application.  "", ""I never have programmed for a database before in the cloud, never have done anything with AI or any scraping of anything online. I only had Java experience and iOS app experience from previous HackPSU's. I was somehow able to get the AI to work, send data to MongoDB, and bring that data back to the java application to be viewed by the user. I slept just under 3 hours.  "", 'The AI actually scans the pictures and returns the resulting keywords and how likely they are true to the Java application after the scraped images are uploaded and processed. The software package gives everyone a tool to use during a natural disaster and for recovery.  ', ""I learned how to work with a MongoDB Atlas database and the collections. I learned how to connect Google Cloud Platform to MongoDB, and how to connect MongoDB to a Java application for the movement of data. I learned how to use Google's Cloud Vision API.

"Shark","We created The Shark Project to help people in San Francisco to easily find a street parking. This is a mobile app designed for users to be a giver or taker of a parking space.","[2194, 'Everyone knows how hard it is to find street parking in the busy city of San Francisco. As a group, we have all had experiences where we go into the city for a shopping trip, a stroll around Golden Gate park or even an hour-long job interview, but end up wasting the day looking for cheap parking. According to an Inrix study of 6,000 U.S. drivers in 10 American cities, the average San Franciscan driver spends 83 hours a year looking for parking. During this time, these drivers add to congestion and air pollution while wasting gas money. So we decided to make a solution to this problem!  ', 'Recognizing this problem, we have created a marketplace to connect drivers looking for parking spaces (""takers"") with drivers leaving parking spaces (""givers""). The website is able to use the destination and preferences of a “taker” to match them with a nearby ""giver"". ""Takers"" pay for the convenience of knowing where the spots are while ""givers"" are compensated for waiting for the ""taker"" to arrive.  ', 'Our website is built as a prototype in Sketch.

"PenniesForGood","Help round up online purchases to donate. Micro donations for macro impact.","[5228, 'We were inspired by a combination of the tracks offered here at HackDuke. Although we were technically limited to just one track, we wanted to try our best and influence all five tracks - helping nonprofits that support education, socioeconomic inequality, health and wellness, and in the future, hopefully also benefit energy and environmental nonprofits. Our idea was founded based on tip jars and “rounding up” at gas stations and restaurants, where even the smallest amount can go a long way. We truly believe that we can make a macro difference with microdonations. ', 'PenniesForGood is a Chrome extension that is activated when a user clicks the “add to cart” button on an online purchasing platform. It will prompt a user to round up their final total to the nearest dollar, whether it be 1 cent or 99 cents, and if the response is yes, a list of charities that are related to their purchase will pop up, following the psychological “jam theory”, to encourage users to select a charity that matters to them to donate too. Our data is also accumulated within a progress bar page that showcases a progress bar to our nearest goal that updates every time someone clicks yes! ', 'Our Google Chrome extension is built using Javascript, CSS, and HTML as the overall framework. We first created our chrome extension template and the extension window that gave information on PenniesForGood and directed users to a graph of their charitable progress in the 3 tracks we created (education, health, hunger). Then we created a buy window that would be enabled when the “add to cart” button in Amazon is clicked. This button will link to another popup that will prompt the user to donate, telling them how much we round up the price too. If the user says says, they are directed to a list of 3 charities based off of the product they bought (e.g if a user buys instant ramen, they are directed to charities looking to address hunger). This price is then updated appropriately in the Amazon checkout. Our data is also accumulated within a progress bar page that showcases a progress bar to our nearest goal that updates every time someone clicks yes! ', 'The first challenges we ran into is that because most of us are novice hackers, we had to learn html, css, and js and the combination of the three to build a chrome extension website. We had to learn how to build progress bars, how to overlay chrome extension pages, how to use the chrome storage, and how to even modify the amazon website, and much more.We constantly ran into errors, debugging problems, buttons overlapping, text not formatting, connecting different files in our project and many more. We wanted to make something that worked, yet didn’t want to make it out of the scope of our abilities. ', 'We were very proud of being able to work so efficiently and cohesively even though most of us had never participated in a hackathon before.  ', ""Some of us had never coded in HTML/Javascript before, so it was a completely new experience for us. In addition, we learned the importance of communicating with each other about pushing and pulling to git. What's next?We want to implement a user login system to keep track of each user’s donations. We want to increase a bigger database of charities and we want to be able to spread it to far more different online platforms.
