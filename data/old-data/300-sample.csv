"Dermax","DerMax is a personal AI skincare disease assistant, which can help patients self-diagnose skin disease and connect the best dermatologists in their vicinity. ","[""Skin cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the US, and other parts of the world alike, though most cases are preventable. The number of people diagnosed with skin cancer in the last three decades is higher than all previous decades combined, and that number is still increasing. $8.1 million dollars a year goes to skin cancer treatment, with $3.3 million alone attribute to melanoma. The ratio of dermatologists vs patients with skin diseases some of the third world countries is 1:6700. Thus, it becomes challenging for patients to find dermatologists and bear a huge financial burden for themselves, their families and substantial healthcare costs for the nation's economy. Earlier diagnosis can prevent patients from missing the best time of treatments, hence can reduce the costs of treatment and avoid complications. It can also be a powerful tool in helping doctors to make a faster, more reliable and more efficient diagnosis of the diseases. We see great potential in technologies like artificial intelligence with various applications in the healthcare industry, which in turn inspires us to use it for solving skin disease prediction problems, to make this world a better place for everyone. In this hackathon, we have developed ‘DerMax’, a personal skincare assistant. "", 'Our proposed product, ‘DerMax’, is a personal skincare assistant that can be used to check if one has any skin disease and by dermatologists, providing an extra hand/brain to create a faster diagnosis of skin diseases. We have created a basic website, on which a patient suspected to have some skin disease, can upload a picture of the affected skin region, and at the backend, our image classifier classifies into one of the 10 possible skin diseases. The website then generates a result that shows the probability of the patient having one of the 10 diseases.

In Google Assistant’s developer platform, we can add parameters such as dates, times, and places that define which parts of the user utterances to extract.

"EcoCal","Climate change has been exacerbated in the past decade. At Mount Holyoke College, we developed an App to increase people's carbon footprint awareness and  help them to be more eco-friendly. ","['In January, 2018, the Board of Trustees set the goal of becoming a carbon-neutral campus by 2037, Mount Holyoke’s bicentennial. So far, the school has done a really good job: reduced electricity use by 16% and thermal energy by 13%. The school has been doing a great job so far, but as members of the community, we wonder: can we contribute to the process as individuals? Thus, our group came up with the idea to develop an App to help the students and faculties to participate in the mission and contribute their own effort. ', ""It learns the user's long-term food preferences and recommends similar foods according to health-factors and eco-factors. The app can increase the usage frequency by giving feedbacks to users' food consumption, their daily carbon footprint and build a community. Here is the interaction procedure:In this part, we include a complete interaction process, including two parts. Environmental behavioural theory Theory of reasoned action (TRA) and theory of planned behaviour (TPB) are common theories used to investigate the factors associated with an individual’s environmental behaviours.Persuasive technology refers to an interactive product that is designed to evaluate changes in attitudes, behaviours and their interactionsThe first part is a pre-survey for first time users, we use environmental behavioral questions and carbon footprint awareness questionnaire (See Appendix 1) to generate personalized eco-friendly scores that’s based on the average carbon footprint of the Moho community. A five-point Likert scale ranging from one to five is used to score responses to each item in the constructs. Each item is constructed according to the national mean and standard deviation. There are two types of questions: a),behavioral questions: “On average, how long does it take you to take a shower? 1, less than 3 mins    2, 3-6 mins    3, 6-9 mins   4, 9-12 mins   5, 12 mins and aboveWe will score this question reversely, add 1 to the total score if the user select ‘12 mins and above. ’b) carbon footprint awareness:“Global warming problems have consequences for my life.”1 Strongly Disagree  2 Disagree 3 Neutral 4 Agree 5 Strongly AgreeWe will add 5 to the total score if the user select ‘Strongly Agree’The app will map the score to the distribution of all users’ scores and present a ranking.After the new user finished the first part, they will join the other users to the second part: Daily log and how to reduce your carbon footprint. It begins the long-term (stable) food preference elicitation. This is to collect what the user generally likes to eat. The user can browse a full catalog of recipes from Mount Holyoke College’s daily menu, and mark those that he/she has eaten or would like to eat that day. This is also the part where the user can specify their diet restrictions. In order to find food recommendations which both appeal the user’s appetite, help them to decrease their carbon dioxide emission and have balanced meals, an active learning technique, which is called User Utility Multidimensional Prediction, is used. We modify existing nutrient-based food recommender algorithm to include additional parameters that are used for modelling the dependencies between the environmental component and and the food preference and nutrition component. "", 'Our first step is to calculate the average daily carbon footprint per capita. We scraped the numbers of annual water, electricity and fuel usage from the school website, multiply them by the carbon emission factor. There are approximately 2,335 students and 312 staff and faculties at Mount Holyoke last year, so we get the daily average carbon footprint per capita: 36012122.87/365/2647 = 37.27 ton/per day/ per personWe also want to take school’s recycling programs into consideration.

"EcoWarriors-A Social Game Challenge ","EcoWarriors-A Social Game Challenge To Bring Awareness and Action Toward Climate Change","[""We develop this project through our very personal experience. We deeply care about our environment. However, when we talk to our friends about the impact of climate change, they just feel like another lecture from Mr. or Ms. Environmentalist. They don't care about the topic because they feel like climate change is a big global issue and they can't do anything to change that. Moreover, many of my friends think climate change is just a scientific myth and they don't see any real impact of it in their daily lives. Therefore, through this Climathon, we get together as a team to develop a game app that can visually show the real impact of climate change and how the players can actually change the effect of it through daily activities. Project Description:My team develop a game called “EcoWarriors” to raise awareness about climate change.  Our goal is to help people change their daily habits and adopt a more sustainable lifestyle. Every action of the users will be tracked and converted to score, that score will be the metrics for the wellbeing of their virtual pet. These actions include: Reducing carbon footprint, Using more renewable energy, wasting Less water, reducing waste ( i.e. Changing to reusable shopping bags), choosing businesses that support green living (partners), recycling, walking instead of drivingGame Storyline:The global climate change becomes a huge problem on Earth and many animals are on the edge of extinction. To prevent the mass extinction from happening, the players will act as a wild-lives rescuers and each of them are assigned with a mysterious egg of an endangered animal. Each animal they are assigned will be the very last one of a species. The players will incubate each egg at the beginning stage of the game. After the players reach a certain score, the egg will reveal their assigned animal ( i.e. penguin, dolphin, whale, polar bear…) Depending on the player’s choice of challenge, a set of tasks will be shown. The tasks are daily action in a person’s life, and every completed task be tracked and converted to score. That score will be the metrics (such as air quality, water quality, energy consumption…) will contribute to the wellbeing of their virtual pet and the improvement of the environment in that animal’s habitat. With higher score level, the virtual animals will slowly bear more eggs and have a family of their own to bring their species out of extinction.  This game raise people’s awareness and educate us about the different sustainable in a friendly and fun way that even a kid can understand. This game is great for individuals or the whole family together. Methods for Score Tracking:Take photos of their electric bills, track decreaseShow receipts of restaurants/businessesTrack geolocation for milage of a person when they are walking or biking.Timing showers and water usageGreen membership card to use on bus or partnered green stores/restaurant/coffee shop/markets. Members with this cards can get discounted at those partnered store, too.Reward for Players:Creating “Badges” for each challenge (i.e. Reducing Plastic Waste)Every month, the community of this game will get together to celebrate the top scored players and listen to their journey of changing their daily habits toward a sustainable living goals. This will help fuel up the motivation of the players and build a stronger community full of exciting environmentally-mindful individual.Data Gathering & Visualization:Summarizing the statistic of average consumption of water and energy on a local-level. Training algorithm with real data to perfect our scoring system. Gathering data about local businesses and markets about their level of green-awareness. Using this data to improve users’ experience and connecting them with the right community partners and organizations which promote the sustainable and green living. Impact of Solutions:This game raise people’s awareness and educate us about the different sustainable in a friendly and fun way that even a kid can understand. This game is great for individuals or the whole family together. Therefore, even the ones who are not so interested in environmental issues before will start to be mindful about it through this game. Our ultimate goal is to raise people’s awareness on the topic of climate change and to motivate community to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle via this gamification project.Future Plan:We are developing the app and working on launching our beta version through limited invitation. Then, when we are confident with our final product, we will launch the official version on the app store and then working on promoting the app through advertising and words-of-mouth. When we have a good initial users base, we will work on building a bigger community. Every month, the community of this game will get together to celebrate the top scored players and listen to their journey of changing their daily habits toward a sustainable living goals. This will help fuel up the motivation of the players and build a stronger community full of exciting environmentally-mindful individual.On the data science side of this project, we will work on:Summarizing the statistic of average consumption of water and energy on a local-level.

"Cashier optimization system,that reduces client wating time.","Automated cashier optimization system, that reduces client waiting time, maximize cashier efficiency, and reduces required number of cashier. Client wins because he is less time wasted in line.","[""inspiration came to me very easily. I often go to the hypermarket for groceries, I did not like the fact that I lost a lot of time in the queue, therefore I decided to write an algorithm that would optimize cashiers ! :)I understood that there are peak hours when there are a lot of buyers, and there is a time where cashier are sitting idle.

There is a high probability of client outflow.View from the business perspective:the company understands that if the number of cashiers is increased, then the customer waiting time will decrease. However, by increasing the number of cashiers the company does not come to satisfactory results; on the contrary, expenses increase due to an increase in payroll.Challenges I ran intoWe agreed that I will complete project in one month, but i spend about 6 month, because project was for real production, and there was many problems that i must to solve.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofI'm glad that with a simple idea, the project turned into a really useful program, here is an example of saving money.N branches x M employees x payroll x 12 months = total payroll expenses• It WAS 40 x 40 x 1000$ x 12 = 19 200 000 dollars per year• It BECAME 40 x 30 x 1000$ x 12 = 14 400 000 dollars per year• Benefit: 720 000 000 (decrease of payroll by ~ 25% )What's next for Cashier optimization system,that reduces client wating time.Built Withforecast.iooptimizationpythonrretai    Created by  Динислам Ораз"", '', '', 'We agreed that I will complete project in one month, but i spend about 6 month, because project was for real production, and there was many problems that i must to solve.', ""I'm glad that with a simple idea, the project turned into a really useful program, here is an example of saving money.N branches x M employees x payroll x 12 months = total payroll expenses• It WAS 40 x 40 x 1000$ x 12 = 19 200 000 dollars per year• It BECAME 40 x 30 x 1000$ x 12 = 14 400 000 dollars per year• Benefit: 720 000 000 (decrease of payroll by ~ 25% )What's next for Cashier optimization system,that reduces client wating time.Built Withforecast.iooptimizationpythonrretai    Created by  Динислам Ораз"", '', '']","['python', 'r', 'forecast.io', 'retai', 'optimization']","False","7","['dinislamos1']","defaults/thumbnail-placeholder.gif","False","0"

"Puzzle of the Day","A daily crossword puzzle game - designed from the ground up only for Alexa","['I\'ve always been interested in building games for voice, as voice is such a different medium than the visual ones we are bombarded with throughout the rest of our day. Voice games are a perfect time to sit back, use your imagination, and really immerse yourself in something, similar to reading a book. It activates your brain in ways you don\'t get from your phone, your TV, your consoles, or your computer.I\'ve built games for Alexa in the past, but for this competition I wanted to focus on something specific, and that was retention. Generally most voice games don\'y have great retention - you play it once, finish the content within a week or so, and you\'re over it. While that can provide for an engaging experience, it\'s not always the best path forward for something like ISP. To make some income, you really want people coming back time and time again.Despite the rise of technology in our day to day, and the decline of traditional newspapers, there is still a massive community of crossworld puzzlers around the globe. People still keep their subscriptions solely for the daily crossword. Crossword puzzles and their fun clues are an amazing brainteaser, forcing you to think deeply about words and their meanings, learning and having fun at the same time. Voice seemed like the perfect medium to translate this sort of experience. Voice games are especially great for those ""in-between times"". It\'s something you can do when you wake up, when you are doing the dishes, doing the laundry, driving etc. You may be doing something mindless with your hands, but still want to engage with your brain. These were the times of day I wanted to target.With an idea in mind, I set to work!', ""Puzzle of the Day is a daily crossword puzzle style game. The puzzles are built from the ground up for Alexa, and are designed as quick 5-10 minute daily experiences.Each puzzle consists of five words, and a theme.It uses clues similar to those you may find in a crossword puzzle, but removes the crossing component from the game. Instead, solving words give you free 'letter reveals' which act in the same way, but you can be strategic about when to use them. If you are stumped on a hard word, you can pass and rack up some letter reveals to help you with that one later.Once the user guesses all five words, they can wager some points on the theme. Points are earned from solving words, having remaining letter reveals, as well as time bonus for finishing under 5, 10 and 15 minutes. You only get one guess for the theme, but guessing correctly with a high wager could let you double your points.Once solving each daily puzzle, you can see how your score compared to others around the world with an in game leaderboard, giving you your percentile and place for time and points for each day. Users who are more interested in the stats can link their accounts and access the online leaderboards that I built for the game. These are available at https://www.stokedskills.com/puzzleoftheday/You can also set up the email service to get a daily email at the end of the day, so you can see how you compared against all the users of the day (because when you play, you can only get stats for people who played thus far)"", ""There are a number of components to this skill:The skill code itself:I built this skill using the Jovo framework. It is developed in Node.js using typescript, and data for each user is being persisted to the skill in DynamoDb. The skill supports the APL interface and has full screen APL support across for all devices, throughout the whole game.The Leaderboards:The leaderboard data can be accessed within the skill, from the website, or from the email service. Leaderboard data is updated whenever a user finishes a puzzle, and is stored in and AWS RDS MySql instance.The Website:The website allows users to view their rankings on a 7 day / Last Month / All time basis. You can look up your user and see your scores for each puzzle you completed. This out of skill component was designed and built to help with user retention. It's built as a static site hosted and Amazon S3, written with javascript in VueJS. Data is accessed via a backend node API hosted in AWS Lambda and API Gateway using the serverless framework. The Email Service:To send emails to users, there is a recurring job each day.  Once a day is completed and we have everyone's scores, we can publish that days results. Using an AWS lambda running on a cron schedule daily, we load up all the scores from the database for the previous day for users that have requested emails. For those users, we calculate their individual stats for percentile and place in time and points and deliver it as an email using Twilio's SendGrid. This system was an integral part of the design as I really wanted to focus on user retention to drive adoption of the ISP.The ISP: For the In Skill Purchase component of the skill, I decided to go with subscriptions. Since I was focused on retention and daily usage, I figured that a recurring model would be the best approach for this skill. I've decided to brand the ISP as the puzzle league, and by subscribing users get extra benefits like more games, and the ability to reveal extra letters. The free component to the game is substantial, but by paying a small monthly fee, those dedicated users can get some extra enjoyment and fun."", ""Because I wanted to build a game of high quality, I included alot of features which increased the scope. Besides the skill itself, I needed to build out the website, the database system for the in-skill leaderboards, and email system, and a content management framework. While building the skill itself, and all the other moving parts were quite a challenge and took lots of iteration to get right, I think the content management aspect was the most interesting challenge I had to face so I wanted to focus on that.Building a daily recurring game means more content every day. To make this word right and with accurate word recognition, I needed to include all of the solutions to the puzzles, including the themes, into the voice model. This means re-certifying with every new puzzle that is added. I could have taken a more risky approach and used an 'open' slot with SearchQuery, but I really wanted the accuracy to be top notch so I took the more involved approach.To get all the data into the skill, I needed a great way to manage the content. Instead of managing the puzzle content in code, I decided it would be way easier to use spreadsheets. In the spreadsheet I can fill in the solutions, the clues, and the themes.From there, I needed to get it into the slots of the skill, and access it from within my skill code. To do so, I built a number of deployment scripts. These scripts are used to do a number of things:Import the spreadsheet into code and convert it into JSON, so the skill code can use it to provide the right puzzlesAutomatically fill in dates and data for all the new puzzles that are addedRun some verification on the generated JSON file to make sure there are no duplicate dates, puzzleIds, etcTake all the words I need from the JSON file in the voice model, (clue answers and theme names) and open up the voice model json file, update the slot values, and save it back to disk so that I could use that to upload to the Alexa service.Upload all the puzzle data into MySql so the website has access to the correct puzzle dataThese scripts allow me to do all the data management I need in only a minute or so, saving me alot of time and potential errors in the future. With this system, I plan to create skill content every 2-3 months, and then update the skill with that data, giving me a nice worry-free window in case things are slow with certification. By automating the process, I can make all those above updates that are pretty far reaching into all of the infrastructure and code of the entire system, without touching the code myself. This really limits the vectors for failure and allows me to spend more of my time focusing on how to improve the game for customers."", ""With all the moving parts, this was probably the most complicated and in depth skill I've built. It's the first one I've built using Subscriptions as an ISP. After spending alot of time on the design, and considering cutting alot of the scope, I'm proud that I completed everything I set out to do, and that I designed it in an efficient and scalable way that requires little maintenance. I'm excited to see how it performs now that its out there in the wild! "", ""Skill development is an amazing learning process, and I learned a ton with this project. While I had experience with some of these technologies before, I took steps to learn and include more technologies whenever I got the chance. For example, as part of this project I learned Typescript and built the entire skill using it. Being my first time using Typescript, it took at bit of studying up, but I think it paid off in the end and my skill is far more maintainable that it would have been without it. I also learned the importance of user testing. As part of the process, I recruited people that I knew to act as beta testers and play through the game for a few weeks before the release. This really allowed me to tweak the difficulty and gameplay and find a level where I think people will gain the most possible enjoyment. As I went through a couple iterations of this I found that each and every piece of feedback I acted on had an immediate effect on the next group of people I had try the game. It's definitely a process that I will continue doing on future projects. "", ""Now that I have everything set up and rolling, the next step is to iterate and improve the experience. Nothing is ever quite perfect on the first try, and that is why I set up a feedback system within the skill. Each day, users can rate the quality of the puzzle. This is stored into my database and I can use it to help me understand what is working and what isn't as I build more puzzles for the future.In addition, I want to iterate on the ISP. I want to find more ways to add value to subscribers with the potential for weekly challenge puzzles, or monthly competitions. I'd love to build out an A/B testing framework for this game so I can truly identify what is working and make smart analytical decisions about where to invest my time next.

That is why our primary focus is to connect them to nearby businesses that will offer discounts and benefits to verifiable evacuees.

"FloodGate","Leveraging Crowd-Sourced Data For Early Flood Warning &amp; Detection","[""Today's world increasingly interacts with natural disasters and climate phenomena, in large part caused by anthropomorphic global warming, For many of us, not only in the US but also around the world, access to definitive pipelines for connections and educational resources is severely lacking, and thus FloodGate provides a streamlined path to help the students, community leaders, and people of the future get a headstart."", 'FloodGate has several functions. The SMS notification system provides persons in need with easy, reliable, and secure access to responders and volunteers, and its intended purpose is to help users identify key events established during the path of a natural disaster so they can make more informed decisions and gain vital contact/rescue information. FloodGate also implements an autonomous, remote, and cheap sensing device, built with multiple contact functionalities and messaging services. This is all compiled into an accessible, user-friendly website which includes resources to heatmaps and real-time models of natural disasters.', ""Twilio API (SMS), Google Maps (GCP), Flask, and NgrokFloodGate's creation required building and utilizing functional RESTful APIs and packages to create a responsive site. The site is styled via Python's Flask library. The backend server is supported by Ngrok, providing localhost access to webhooks. The SMS ping system is backed entirely by Twilio's Programmable SMS API, providing FloodGate users and first-responders with RESTful, real-time notifications. We also use Firebase's Cloud Firestore database service to host our sensor and SMS data (with SQLite3 as an offline backup) and GCP's Google Maps Platform to display location-based data on interactive maps.Arduino, C, Python, Matplotlib and a Whole Lot of SolderThe FloodGate sensor is built using an Arduino 101 and Ultrasonic Distance Module HR-S04 using the established Arduino IDE and C. Serial data is handling via Python's PySerial library."", 'It was my first time making an actual project on an Arduino, and I had never really used Flask before. In the process of making the site, I ran into several production issues with Ngrok. Additionally, I encountered difficulties connecting to the development server on several instances, and the Twilio versioning proved challenging for the back-end.', ""I'm amazed that I was able to complete FloodGate over such a small duration, especially considering my lack of experience with Flask and Arduino. I faced many set-backs with the site interface, so ultimately having a working version of the site pushed into production was extremely fulfilling."", 'Coming into this project as a Flask novice, I had absolutely no experience with anything related to the Twilio API, and minimal experience with Ngrok servers and design. However, I managed to bridge this gap by constantly pushing myself to learn more about C, poring over documentation, and seeking help when needed on StackOverflow and Google. Ultimately, I needed to think and rethink the overall coding process, and finding that common ground and challenging myself to truly understand code instead of haphazardly copying it from forum pages really allowed me to progress. I was also able to experiment with new technologies such as Cloud Firestore, SQLite3, Ngrok, and others.', ""I hope to expand the site into a fully integrated site complete with enhanced user experiences and design. I'm also actively pushing myself to create an iOS app for FloodGate, which I hope to push into production soon!

"Expirology","Managing expiration dates to reduce food waste","['There is $42.8 billion per year in food waste in the US. The current state of expiration labels in the world is overly complicated and results in massive amounts of food waste. We have all seen the combinations of ""Best by"", ""Use by"", and ""Sell by"" dates on the expiration labels of all sorts of products. Upon doing further research, we realized that these terms do not actually convey the expiration date of the product. For example, the term ""best buy"" is when the flavor is the best, not when the product expires. Over 33% of participants in a study conducted last year incorrectly assumed date labeling is federally regulated and another 26% were unsure. With Expirology, we aim to create a system for managing expiration dates based on the USDA database of refrigerator shelf life, rather than the confusing manufacturer labels.', 'Expirology is an iOS application that reduces food waste through an organizational system and greater freedom of information. By integrating a variety of federally regulated databases about expiration dates, the application can either use manual entry or a picture of a food and add it to your list of expiration dates. Expirology also sorts the expiration dates on the home page and has a comprehensive list to search through as well.', 'We decided to build this by dividing into different product development roles and teams. Vishal created a custom API that the iOS application could query data from using Python, Flask, and HTML. Rahul combined databases of information while cleansing and parsing through thousands of datapoints of expiration dates using Pandas in Python. Harish developed the front-end iOS application using SwiftUI which calling the API and displays the information for the user. Arjun worked in a variety of roles, from data scraping to flask development and front-end design within the team. James focused on using web scraping techniques through Python and BeautifulSoup to harvest and add data to our database.', ""Creating the API, gathering data, and handling dataflow in iOS were the most challenging aspects of this project. Although we knew Python beforehand, applying this knowledge and creating a RESTful API service using Flask as the backend was a new area for all of us and had many challenges as well. Further, although there are many databases available about food nutrition, there is not nearly as much about expiration dates since they are not federally regulated and depend on the manufacturer's discretion. Thus, we had to use web scraping to gather our own data as curated datasets were not available. The dataflow in iOS was also one of the biggest challenges we faced since SwiftUI is a relatively new platform and there are many differences in it, especially how the dataflow is handled."", ""We're really proud of the iOS application and RESTful API we created for this project. Since all of us are freshmen, none of us had prior experience with technologies for creating custom APIs for our data as well as integrating this into an iOS application. Being able to create a platform based on a concept that we are all really passionate about makes us incredibly happy. We're happy that we learned new technologies and stepped out of our comfort zone, all while coding for good."", 'We all learned about the value of communication within a team. Although each one of us had our own tasks to work on, we all needed each other and work together in order to actually develop the application. We used a lot of delegation and constant communication to get help from others and solve problems together. None of us had any particular front or back-end experience and we learned a lot about working outside what we know. In terms of technical skills, we all picked up a new application of languages we knew, whether it was Flask for Python or SwiftUI. These skills, along with the communication skills we learned, are truly invaluable.', ""At Expirology, we're passionate about having as much accessibility within our platform as possible. In the future, we would like to include multilingual support as well as text-to-speech features to improve the outreach of the app and how easy it is for a person of any age or background to use. We would also like to gather a wider database of expiration dates and include dates for products that are not refrigerated since currently we only handle those, simply due to time constraints. We would also like to add features such as text recognition from receipts that could be scanned since this would streamline the process for the user even more!""]","['swift', 'python', 'flask', 'ios', 'machine-learning', 'neural-networks', 'computer-vision', 'html']","False","0","['vishaldubey01', 'arjun94022', 'hyerra08', 'jameslim', 'rahulprakash012']","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/881/021/datas/small.png","False","0"

"Regen Network - ReDAOMint","A reDAOmint is a DeFi mechanism that encourages investors to invest in the future ecological health of the planet in a way that generates win-win scenarios for everyone involved","[""Protecting Earth's most precious natural environments - such as the Amazon rainforest - is often dangerously dependent on unstable political and economic forces. While the Amazon's critical importance as a carbon sink, source of oxygen, and biodiversity hotspot is widely acknowledged worldwide, the local economics in inhabited portions of the forest are often not conducive to protecting this planetary treasure. Instead of relying on government policies and inefficient charities, what if we could create a decentralized economic vehicle that made long-term protection of the forest economically beneficial for local residents? "", 'For a slide-show presentation see https://bit.ly/redaomint. For a screen-cast see: https://share.getcloudapp.com/NQuejBzyA reDAOmint (regenerative + endowment + DAO + tendermint) is a shareholder DAO that holds a pool of assets for perpetuity, distributing the dividends of those assets with land stewards in critical bioregions in exchange for protecting the land. The DAO funds itself by minting new shares in exchange for valuable market assets that produce dividends or rewards (such as staking tokens).The assets in the DAO are managed by the shareholders who can rebalance the portfolio and move staking tokens to their parent zones over IBC to delegate them and collect rewards. Through good management of the funds, the asset value should grow and produce dividends. The dividends cannot, however, be directly withdrawn by the shareholders - they are instead distributed to land stewards whose good land stewardship has been verified, ideally by a low cost technology such as satellite verification (something Regen Network is already actively working on).Land stewards enter into a contract with the DAO to protect the land, and as long as they keep protecting it they will receive dividends on a regular basis. This provides a continuous supplementary income stream for these land stewards. If, however, they degrade the land by deforesting it, their share of DAO rewards gets slashed, returned to the DAO and they can no longer participate. In this way the reDAOmint acts as a long term financial support vehicle for the land, which goes beyond what unstable government or non-profit support could provide.For investors in the reDAOmint, the investment is not, however, simply a charity and could also be consider a decentralize public hedgefund. reDAOmint shares provide dividends that come in the form of ecosystem service credits. These credits represent unaccounted ecological benefits from protecting the land which is an emerging asset class  estimated to grow from 36B USD in 2017 to 1T USD over next 20 years. An example of these are carbon credits, which will be increasingly demanded by governments and the public. reDAOmint shareholders can either use the ecosystem service credits they have received as dividends for their own offseting purposes or sell them on the market.In comparison to traditional mechanisms for protecting land, a reDAOmint provides the following benefits:insulates land stewards from seasonal variation in the ecological health of landinsulates land stewards from volatility in the price of ecosystem service creditsefficiently generates ecosystem services by good capital managementauditability of all funding and verification activity', 'The reDAOmint is built using the Cosmos SDK using a fork of cosmos/gaia that includes IBC support. A diff of our work can be seen here: https://github.com/regen-network/reDAOmint/pull/3.We produced two new Cosmos modules and an ORM package to create the reDAOmint.redaomint moduleThe redaomint module implements a shareholder DAO that produces dividends of ecosystem service credits for shareholders and dividends of the underlying asset pool for allocated land stewards as described above. It also provides governance proposal and voting support for shareholders. It uses the existing Cosmos bank and supply modules to track holdings of shares, and interacts with the ecocredit module for verification of good land stewardship and distributing credits. The primary documentation for the module can be found here: https://github.com/regen-network/reDAOmint/blob/reDAOmint/x/redaomint/keeper.goecocredit moduleThe ecocredit module provides a fractional NFT with metadata specific to ecosystem service credits. It allows for:the creation of new credit classes with a list of approved issuersthe issuance of credits for a specific piece of land and time frameexchange of fractional portions of individual creditsburning credits in order to remove them from circulation (in the language of carbon credits this is called retiring and means that you are using the credit as an offset)Documentation here: https://github.com/regen-network/reDAOmint/blob/reDAOmint/x/ecocredit/keeper.goorm packageIn order to make the implementation of the above modules easier, we implemented an orm package to handle secondary indexes and the automatic generation of ID\'s.

A Flask server I deployed on a Google Cloud Platform Instance receives the button press POST request, sends that email/text, logs the request in MongoDB Atlas, and will send emails in the future of supply expiry - when the new supplies come, the server will send reminders that we should throw away the new supplies after their expiry.How I built itThe device is simple, using 4 simple tactile buttons wired to a Particle Photon, which connects via webhooks to a Flask server deployed to a Google Cloud Platform VM instance. The Flask server uses the MongoDB Atlas API to save all button press requests for order confirmation and supply information, Twilio to send texts to users, and Sendgrid to send emails as well. The enclosure was designed in SolidWorks, sliced in Cura, and printed on a Lulzbot Taz6 and Creality CR-10mini. What's next for buttonsI will see how I can couple the device to actually order supplies directly- like the Amazon Dash button. I will also add more functionality to the buttons-- and will build more button devices! The device can also be used by consumers- put this device on your fridge so you get reminded to throw out that old milk, or to use your peppers before they go moldy!

"Squink","Squink is an automated market maker that enables extremely low cost swaps between USD stablecoins","['Decentralized exchanges (DEXes) provide services that are almost identical to those available from traditional centralized exchange (CEXes), but at substantially higher prices. This price discrepancy is clearly reflected in usage statistics. Today, DEXes mediate less than one percent of daily crypto trading volume. To work towards changing this, we decided to focus on a single segment of the exchange sector, stablecoin swaps, where DEXes have the largest potential cost advantage. Our product, Squink, will enable users to swap between different stablecoins at less than half of the cost of any existing service.  ', 'Squink is an automated market maker that enables extremely low cost swaps between USD stablecoins, e.g. DAI, USDC, and Terra. Fees for utilizing Squink are in the range of 0.05 percent of exchanged volume or $0.50 USD for a $1000 exchange. This is less than half the cost of Binance, the cheapest existing provider. Much like Uniswap, Squink is a lightweight plug n’play module that is easy to integrate into other financial and non-financial products. By integrating Squink, decentralized exchange aggregators can take advantage of small differentials between prices quoted in DAI, USDC, Terra, etc. to save their users substantial amounts of money. Likewise, the exchanges themselves can utilize Squink to aggregate their stablecoin trading pairs into a single integrated order book that offers better prices and deeper liquidity. Finally, e-commerce sites can uitilize Squink to accept any stablecoin, while still receiving payment in their preferred currency.    ', ""Under the hood, Squink uses a generalization of the Uniswap constant product formula that allows for multiple assets and a user-specified level of price volatility. In very low volatility markets such as stablecoins, this optimization allows Squink to support an extremely high level of liquidity using a very small pool of capital. We created our own Tendermint-based chain using Lotion to implement the automated market maker and to host various faux stablecoins.Accomplishments that we're proud ofSquink has the potential to undercut all existing services by 2-fold or more (10-fold if we consider Coinbase). We’re very proud of such a clearcut value proposition.What's next for SquinkWe would like to configure Squink to hold the bulk of its stablecoin assets in a reserve composed of interest-bearing form, such as cDAI or cUSDC.

"Birdie","Letting your community know you're safe, even after you depart the nest","['Transitioning from living in one city to another can always be jarring change.  Although the novelty can be exhilarating, taking flight and seeking out a new social support system may prove to be a daunting task.  Yet, no matter the people we hold close in our lives, from those we’ve known our entire lives to the lab partner we met just a few weeks ago, having those people in our community means the same: ensuring that we feel connected, safe, and taken care of.We wanted to make that process of building and maintaining community easier.  Especially in a major metropolitan city like Austin, safety can be of paramount concern.  Whether they walk, scooter, or rideshare, our final salutation in seeing people off is wishing them safe travels.  Even after departing the nest, Birdie lets you and your loved ones know that those in your community have made it to their destination safely. What is DoesOur app allows users to send/share a history of their location data to those within their community.  The sender presses a button to start their trip, sending friends/family a notification.  From there, receivers can view the person’s trip by viewing the path they followed on a map.  Afterwards, the sender presses a button to end the trip they scheduled, allowing others to know they arrived safely.What Makes it Different?Other location trackers only provide a live view of where people are.  Although this is useful, allowing others to be notified of when you take a trip allows for a practical experience.  For instance, you can send your location on FaceBook messenger, but this can get lost in the messages.  Apps like Strava may be able to track paths you take, but are primarily geared towards running and exercise without having features dedicated to safety.  We wanted an elegant app dedicated for safety that allows for convenient, practical sharing of location.How we Built itWe created our app in Android App Studio, using Google Firebase as a server to store and transmit location data.
