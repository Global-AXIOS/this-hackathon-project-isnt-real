It is having 4 major modules:Traffic Feed (Userbase: Drivers, Pedestrians, Passengers): Users can post anything related to city traffic on the feed in order to inform other about it, this will be visible to everyone. Users can add image and tags in their posts to make their posts more comprehensible. Sample content of feed can be accident alert, traffic jam, congestion alert, or general post.  Pedestrian Mode (Userbase: Pedestrians)Activate pedestrian mode while walking on the streets. This will alert you to nearby road intersections, dangers and other hazards related to pedestrian safety. These alerts are given when the user reaches 20m in the range of any potential hazardous geo-location.   Parking Finder (Drivers)Parking finder will show you nearby parking spots and the numbers of current free parking spots in the parking in real time. Real-time data is maintained by another supportive application - Travis Parking Assist which I've built. This app will be used by the watchman of the parking spot to update the number of entries of vehicles in the parking.

"Lucidchart OnPrem for Confluence Server","Others are going cloud—we're taking our top web-based add-on to OnPrem with cutting edge functionality in Confluence","[4640, ""Over 300+ customers have requested an onpremises add-on from Lucidchart. We built this for them, and for all the others who wanted Lucidchart, but were unable to adopt our cloud-based solution.Why it's specialWhile we were not able to replicate all of web-based Lucidchart's functionality (e.g., mobile apps, @mentioning, free integrations, etc.), we still wanted to deliver the premier self-hosted solution for Confluence. Below are a few features that only we are able to offer to customers behind firewalls.Real-time collaboration - multiple editors can diagram together in real-time without overriding each other's edits, enhancing collaboration. Lucidchart OnPrem is the first self-hosted add-on with real-time collaborationIn-editor collaboration - comment on shapes, leave feedback, and record next steps within the diagramPresentation-mode - easily create presentations from diagrams for meetings, or embed as slides in pagesVisio import / export - high-fidelity Visio import and exportAuto-generate diagrams - automatically generate ERDs and other diagrams from source files, like .schemaAll of these features come in addition to the standard functionality of creating, editing, and embedding diagrams, charts, and visuals to improve communication in Confluence. Lucidchart also includes extensive templates and shape libraries for network diagrams, flowcharts, UML diagrams, UI mockups, Venn diagrams, org charts and more. How we built itWe reimplemented some of the back end code of our cloud app within the Confluence environment and tweaked the front end to work with it. In the process we had to make significant changes to core system concepts like users, collaboration, comments, diagrams, and attachments so that they make sense on this new platform. Since this add-on has to work on instances without any internet access, we had to bundle all the necessary resources (js, css, images, fonts, templates, etc.) inside the add-on instead of loading them on-demand from a CDN. Implementing some of our unique features like real-time collaboration was particularly challenging as this is not a feature implemented for Server-based add-ons, and the approach was new to the add-on ecosystem.Challenges we ran intoWe ran into several major challenges in taking the functionality of our add-on from the cloud to fully onpremises. Among these were challenges enabling real-time collaboration, using an embedded rich viewer within Confluence to create slide shows, and taking our 100% cloud-based functionality into a format that can be used entirely behind a firewall.What's next for Lucidchart OnPrem for Confluence ServerWe are currently taking the lessons we learned from building Lucidchart OnPrem and applying them to our web-based Lucidchart add-on. These changes will make both products faster, more reliable, and more valuable to our end users. Aside from the business push, we also plan to continue iterating and improving upon the add-on based on customer feedback. For instance, we will be releasing a new version with improved revision history controls shortly.SummaryJust like taking a Server-based add-on to the Cloud, taking Lucidchart to the Server was challenging and required many large and small changes to our existing product to deliver an excellent solution for our customers.

"Maasto-101","Off-road driver assist BOT thats helps drivers to identify potholes on street, Especially on terrain regions ","[5305, 'While on my trip to a hilly terrain region in remote parts of India, I faced a lot of difficulties to drive through the region, which had challenges like muddy slippery road, lack of street lights and U shaped curves. This was a common problem among tourist and goods travelers in this region frequently, which increased the maintenance cost of their vehicle. I took this as an opportunity to resolve this problem, which gave rise to Maasto-101 ', 'Maasto-101 detects potholes on the streets through image processing and indicates you the depth of the pothole in a 3D visual graph with the exact location of the pothole on the Map. This data is also stored which can be shared with government officials to improve the street conditions. Data collected through frequent analysis of such streets can be collected and sent to Research and Development team to decide upon the material required to fix the street for long term viability. ', 'Maasto-101 Version1 is built using Arduino 101 that transmits  6-axis Gyroscope and Accelerometer data through BLE to Raspberry Pi 3, Here the data is stored for further processing and also a real time 3D graph is drawn using Plotly. NEO 6M GPS attached to Raspberry Pi 3 gives continuous latitude and longitude of the location, those location details are stored in the database and also drawn on Map to give the visual of the location to the driver. A camera attached to Maasto-101 will capture images and process those images to identify potholes. Identified potholes are highlighted with a green box on the actual image and the visual is shared with the user, this helps him to avoid the potholes when he/she drives through the region. The images captured are processed using Open source OpenCV python library.Image captured along with the processed image, location is highlighted on the Map, and a 3D graph of the pothole is drawn on a dashboard to the user. This dashboard can be accessed either in mobile or a tab. ', ""The initial challenge was to get 6-axis accelerometer and gyroscope data over BLE to Raspberry Pi 3, Since there were limitations on the size of bytes transferred over BLE we had to break accelerometer and gyroscope data and transmit both separately with some milliseconds difference. Next was to get the data captured into a visual 3D graph this was done using the Plotly graph, keeping the refresh rate to 5 seconds. 3D graph won't be visible in selected old version devices which don't support WebGL 2.0, As Plotly uses WebGL 2.0 in 3D charts. "", 'We were able to finish up initial MVP version1 of Maasto-101. we were able to overcome the challenges of transmitting data over BLE using trial and error mechanism of various different BLE libraries, visualizing the data taken from 6-axis gyroscope and accelerometer onto a 3D Plotly graph.Maasto-101 version1 will be tested in real scenarios with upgraded toy car for a further reliability of the model.This gives us a boost and confidence to develop the version2 of Maasto-101 which involves high capacity Drone with data analysis on potholes captured.We hope that sharing those statistics with government will help them to improve the current street conditions and give a better living to the people around the region. Improvement in the street conditions will reduce the maintenance cost of goods supplier vehicles and frequent travelers.We are proud of ourselves that we were able to contribute to our society with this innovation and a very big Thanks!!! to Intel Technologies by conducting such a hackathon.

"ChedliTaxi","ChedliTaxi is the “snap-cab” application that lets you instantly catch a taxi without having to wave your hand !","[5344, ""In Morocco, cabs are allowed to have multiple stops to pick up a maximum of three passengers. Therefore, a taxi driver who already has a passenger aboard is constrained to only pick up other passengers _ going the same way_. Eventually, before getting into the cab, the passenger has to ask the driver if they are both going the same direction, which can be  exhausting for both passengers and taxi drivers. In mid-August, my teammate and I came across the Code4Cabs Challenge and found it a great opportunity to contribute to enhancing the taxi-driver/passenger experience in Morocco. In fact, before starting the development of the project, Ali and I have conducted a survey where we have asked more than 120 taxi drivers from Rabat and Casablanca about their preferences about applications they may need. This experience was very enriching as it allowed us to study the real need of taxi drivers which inspired us to come up with ChedliTaxi. According to our survey audience, here is the taxi-driver's wish list:I do not want to stop if the client is not getting into the cab.I need a way to know the client's destination before stopping.I do not want to be stopped by two people when I have only one free seat.I need a service that will tell me where the nearest next potential clients are.I do not want to make detours to reach to clients and find out they are going to a different locations. Unfortunately, all the applications available to users and taxi-drivers are based solely Google Maps and Geocoding APIs, which do not give precise information in Morocco (wrong direction, nonexistent streets.) Worse, although these services can be very efficient when used in developed countries, using them in Morocco just makes the driver's wish list longer.Our idea is to make use of the most powerful CPU in the business, the driver's brain, to judge whether a client is worth picking or not. In fact, the process was mainly inspired from the wish list above; ChedliTaxi lets you send a request with a vocal message to drivers that are on the same street as you, or at most 300 meters away from you. What ChedliTaxi doesThe application comes in a passenger version and a taxi driver one. The typical Chedli Taxi workflow is as follows:The application set the departure point to the current location of the clientThe client records a Voice Message about the destination and chooses the number of seats needed (1 to 3)The application's algorithm takes care of broadcasting the request to only cabs who are in the same street as the client, or those who are at most 300 meters away.The drivers receive the request, see the client position on the map and the number of seats, listen to the voice message, judge the route (as if they were stopped, but without wasting time) then either Accept or Decline the request.The client can track drivers on the mapThe client can choose to send a new request, in which case, the previous request expiresChallenges we ran intoAs we only found out about the project one month and a half ago, developing ChedliTaxi was not a straightforward job. As you may know, proper Android development takes time especially when dealing with a Real-Time communication application (synchronization of tasks...).In fact, we have received many returns with nonexistent streets and wrong directions that made the Exception Handling process very tiring. Accomplishments that we're proud ofWe are glad that the application made it through almost all the tests, from sending the request until having it accepted by a driver. The minimal bugs reported during the testing phase are to be fixed and patched in ChedliTaxi V2.What's next for ChedliTaxiActually, clients will fall in love with ChedliTaxi if there is a big number of drivers using it as well. The client would ideally use the application to find available taxis instantly. Therefore, the next phase is application marketing; we need to have as many drivers and clients using the application.

Our solution? FiB because  With 1.5 Billion Users, Every Single Tweak in an Algorithm Can Make a Change, and we dont stop at just one. ', 'Our algorithm is two fold, as follows:Content-consumption: Our chrome-extension goes through your facebook feed in real time as you browse it and verifies the authenticity of posts. These posts can be status updates, images or links. Our backend AI checks the facts within these posts and verifies them using image recognition, keyword extraction, and source verification and a twitter search to verify if a screenshot of a twitter update posted is authentic. The posts then are visually tagged on the top right corner in accordance with their trust score. If a post is found to be false, the AI tries to find the truth and shows it to you.Content-creation: Each time a user posts/shares content, our chat bot uses a webhook to get a call. This chat bot then uses the same backend AI as content consumption to determine if the new post by the user contains any unverified information. If so, the user is notified and can choose to either take it down or let it exist.

"Open Mind","A Chrome extension to combat fake news and expose readers to differing political viewpoints.","[3587, 'In a sense, social media has democratized news media itself -- through it, we have all become ""news editors"" to some degree, shaping what our friends read through our shares, likes, and comments. Is it any wonder, then, that ""fake news"" has become such a widespread problem? In such partisan times, it is easy to find ourselves ourselves siloed off within ideological echo chambers. After all, we are held in thrall not only by our cognitive biases to seek out confirmatory information, but also by the social media algorithms trained to feed such biases for the sake of greater ad revenue. Most worryingly, these ideological silos can serve as breeding grounds for fake news, as stories designed to mislead their audience are circulated within the target political community, building outrage and exacerbating ignorance with each new share. We believe that the problem of fake news is intimately related to the problem of the ideological echo chambers we find ourselves inhabiting.

Second, the user is given direct feedback on how partisan their reading patterns are, in the form of a dashboard which tracks their political browsing history.

Our people are distributed geographically and across many time zones, working on very large software projects around the clock. Most of the work is done by people that are not in the room with us - people who are awake when we are sleeping. This gap makes it critical to communicate vision, requirements, status and bugs as clearly as possible, or else we’re stuck having to wait until tomorrow to try again.We set out to design something that is a game-changer for remote team communication.  We needed HYFY to be as powerful as video conferencing but not require everyone to be online at the same time.  Our goal is to make HYFY the simplest way to record your screen & voice and share instantly so the team just “gets it.” With a single click, you can narrate a video story of your work and share it immediately wherever your team works.  In our case, that's JIRA and HipChat. "", ""HYFY is a Google Chrome extension that records your screen and voice along with your mouse cursor.  You just click the extension button, select Tab or Full Screen recording and select Start Recording. When you're finished, HYFY gives you a video link that you can copy and paste anywhere.  Viewers can see the video without installing any software.  HYFY also offers direct integration with HipChat and JIRA for sharing into your team's workspace.The FREE version can record a single browser tab for up to 4 minutes.  The PRO version ($5/month) lets you record your full screen or any individual window for up to 60 minutes.  Both versions integrate with HipChat for direct sharing to any group or channel, while the PRO version adds a JIRA integration that allows you to create new JIRA issues or update existing JIRA issues with videos right from within HYFY's share dialog.Here is a sample HYFY that shows you how to get started: Getting Started with HYFYWhat is it good for?Here are some great uses we’ve discovered for HYFY within JIRA and HipChat:documenting customer complaints, bugs and feature requestsproviding support assistance back to customerssharing feedback on a live application or set of comps/screenshotsnarrating a peer deliverable/code reviewrecording sprint reviews and status reportsexplaining product roadmaps or demoing competing productssending feedback to designer and UX prosHOWTOs, walkthroughs, help articles and product demospracticing video broadcasting for upcoming demonstrationstraining videostask list capture/bookmarking "", ""The extension utilizes Google Chrome's desktop capture API for initial screen and voice recording. We then use Chrome's native client capabilities to run native C++ code that encodes the video in a compact WEBM format.

"IRIS","Comprehensive Indoor tracking, control and monitoring solution","[7336, 'While working with one of our customers we realized several manufacturing facilities lack a comprehensive indoor tracking, automation and control system. Most of the available solutions are GPS based, which is not a viable technology indoors. We realized that there is a definitive need for a location based solution that can track, automate and monitor indoor manufacturing facilities. ', 'IRIS is a complete indoor automation solution which uses BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) Beacons and BLE Receivers to track movable assets inside an indoor facility.  Alongside tracking, IRIS aims at automating the different touch-points in a factory like entry and exit boom barriers, weighing scales and loading bays.IRIS also provides a comprehensive event view for the real time position and status of assets on a top view of the facility. The real time view obviously scores over a monitoring based on CCTV as it provides a detailed, qualitative and quantitative information like the weight measured, driver details of the truck, amount of finished good loaded, event history etc.Safety compliance is a major concern for manufacturing facility. There are not many automated ways for detecting non-compliance, thereby endangering the workers in the facility. IRIS uses  a live feed to detect anomalies based on pre-configured rules. A simple non compliance like not wearing a safety helmet is detected real time and an alarm is raised. This reduces the chances of accidents. ', ""There was no better way of demonstrating the solution than actually applying it to a scaled down version of a manufacturing facility.  The first step was to build a scaled down model of the facility with touch points that we could integrate and control electronically. Our scaled down model included functioning boom barriers, weighing scales, Unloading Bays, Parking Areas and Surveillance cameras.A boom barrier, for instance was created using a Servo motor and Ultrasonic Sensors connected to ESP 12E microcontroller. The boom barrier is actuated by commands sent over MQTT by a Raspberry Pi which doubles up as a BLE receiver and IoT Hub client. Each of these devices are registered in Azure's IoT Hub. When a truck (tagged with a BLE beacon) approaches the boom barrier, a series of parameters are sent over to Azure for authentication. The data is validated and an Acknowledged/Not Acknowledged command is sent back to the BLE receiver. Based on the response, the boom barrier is opened. This principle is followed for the weighing scale and loading bay as well.The data captured by the device is passed on to the gateway which is then passed on to IoT Hub. IoT Hub is responsible for passing it on to Logic apps which is in responsible for processing, storing events and responding to the device with commands. The entire model as seen in the video was built using a combination of Actuators (motors), Sensors, Controllers and Raspberry Pis. The weighing scale used CZL 601 Load cell, HX 711 sensor connected to ESP8266 node MCU and the unloading bay used a water pump motor connected to motor driver L298N motor driver, all connected to an ESP 12E NodeMCU.We used toy trucks to model movable assets and proximity BLE Beacons for location tracking of the movable assets indoor. There were several components like the buildings, roads etc that were built for aesthetics and were not necessarily electronically controlled.The compliance was constructed using Deep Learning.A camera is connected to a Raspberry Pi which is running an object detection model based on Google's Mobilenet_SSD. Whenever a human is detected, the frame of the live video is sent over to Azure's CustomVision.Here, we trained a model to check if the input frame consists of a Helmet and Vest, which are two essential wearables for safety. "", ""We became aware of the hackathon a few weeks before the deadline and naturally getting a working model built was a challenge. Right from procuring beacons and other electronics and putting it all together as a working model was challenging.We further ran into issues with interference from WiFi signals and other remote control based equipment which required adjustments in the receivers to siphon out the noise. While beacons are reasonably reliable as locating devices with significant distance between two beacons, in a scaled down model this was a challenge. The beacons had to be re-calibrated along with the receivers to sense two beacons a few centimeters apart.One significant challenge was to build a single script that would run on each of the Raspberry Pi's to make it a BLE receiver, communicate with Azure over MQTT and control other peripherals (boom barrier, weighing scale, loading bay) over a local MQTT network. We had to ensure that the Pi would be robust enough to handle the multiple data transactions, leaving no room for bugs or events that render the receiver in a locked down state. "", 'We were able to put together a fully integrated and functional solution in a short span of time. The scaled down model works as an excellent device to test how the solution could potentially function (or malfunction) in a real life scenario. Our ability to integrate the solution Azure IoT Hub end to end provided us the chance of using several components of Azure which made the back end integration reasonable seamless and simple for us. The client integration with Azure IoT Hub from Raspberry Pi can boast of being reasonably scalable and seamless. ', 'Azure provides a comprehensive ecosystem to connect devices and automate processes. With IoT Hub, Service Bus, Logic Apps and Functions it is possible to configure a new use case in a matter of hours as against days with other conventional approaches.While BLE is a promising technology for indoor navigation elaborate care need to be taken to ensure that the beacons and receivers are properly calibrated and necessary algorithm has been put in place to weed out noise because of interference from other radio sources. ', 'We intend to continue the development of IRIS in a full fledged project to cater to the needs of the industry. At Integration Wizards (www.iwizardsolutions.com) we have substantial experience deploying Industrial IoT solutions to several fortune 500 customers.

It is these realisations that led us to devise a solution for Urban Water management that holds the city dwelling folks accountable for their actions and is easily scalable globally. The solution aspires to use the power of technology to manage not just California’s but the world's water crisis problem and remind everyone that Water is a precious resource that needs to be used wisely. "", 'Our proposal to replace conventional water meters with Samsung ARTIK based Smart meters across California, coupled with a user friendly interactive dashboard with applied business intelligence in the background provides a completely digital and collaborative platform to effectively manage water consumption for consumers and water authorities alike. As the day starts, ARTIK installed in the home receives email from the water authorities and this initiates the filling of water tanks up to the daily limit of water allotted to a particular house. Once the water passes through the flow meter, an impeller rotates and toggles an output line which can be used to calculate the amount of water used. Each pipeline is installed with water flow meters to give water consumed readings for an individual activity. In addition, moisture sensor are provided to measure the moisture level in the areas like garden.An interactive dashboard is designed to provide real time water consumption data to the user. The data is also uploaded to the SAMI cloud simultaneously. In addition to providing live consumption data, the dashboard provides live Twitter tweets and customized water saving tips thus allowing the homeowner to make better informed decisions. The smart meter and dashboard also serves as a link between the homeowner and the water authorities. Homeowner can directly report leaks and other problems to the authorities thus reducing water wastage. They can also view their water bills. For authorities, they can easily track and manage leakage and complaints centrally. They can also easily roll-out new regulations centrally. E.g. The Smart meter can be set to automatically disable the irrigation system for specific postcodes on specific days. (With compliance to privacy laws). ', 'We took the word ‘Bulit’ so seriously that we actually built from scratch, a livable prototype model of a home having living room, kitchen, washroom and a garden area within our startup office space. The new home and bean bag is so comfy that nobody wants to work in their desks anymore!Next step was to make it a ‘Smart Home’. Wandering the market place in the scorching heats of Delhi and digging out the best deal for our sensors, we found that the prices for water meters vary quite drastically (from $250+ for industrial grade sensors to $6 for garden hose attachments that limit total usage based on rough estimates). We settled on a $6 water meter used for water heater (the YF-S201 Hall Effect Water Flow Counter) due to its accuracy, low price, small size, electronic sensing method that could be easily measured by a microcontroller (such as an Arduino) and obviously for its price too! Once we finished enjoying our milkshakes and admiring our new built home, it was time to get to the fun part. Firstly we embedded the water tank and all the pipes with sensors like water flow meters and outdoor garden areas with soil moisture sensor. Secondly, the conventional water meter was replaced with Samsung ARTIK 10. As MQTT has emerged as a standard messaging protocol for IoT, we followed the publish-subscribe (“pub/sub”) model here and ARTIK 10 plays a key role on the network as the ""message broker"". We set up an ARTIK 10 device with Mosquitto to become a simple MQTT broker and used Node-RED development tool to easily send and receive MQTT messages.Since we wanted to have an internet connected data-stream of our water usage from all the pipes, we decided to try out the Node-MCU with built-in WiFi and made them as our edge devices. Each water flow meter is connected to its Node-MCU module having a code for sending water flow readings to the ARTIK running MQTT server. We then subscribed them to messages published to the broker (i.e. ARTIK 10). Data was then sent to the server (i.e. ARTIK 10) at regular intervals when the water source was in use.In total we have used:One flow meter for kitchenOne each for shower, water closet and wash basin respectively.One flow meter for water inlet of tank and one flow meter for water outlet of the tank.Apart from it we have used two water solenoids with Node-MCU which can be controlled wirelessly through ARTIK 10 and being a server connected to internet, the solenoids can be controlled externally by the authorities. First solenoid, integrated with soil moisture sensor for turning on the controlled water supply used for gardening the plants and another on the inlet of water tank. Only gardening solenoid can be controlled via our interactive dashboard.To visualize the data and make sense of water usage patterns over time, we made a dashboard using iobroker.vis on ARTIK 10 to achieve user friendly interactive display. This allowed us to place a display next to the drawing room for immediate feedback, while still offering us a more holistic view to compare multiple sources and look at first-order trends. ', 'We think no HDMI input/output feature enabled on ARTIK 10 until the deadline of this challenge was the bigger challenge for us. This led to us having some problem creating and showing dashboard on ARTIK.While the dashboard was running on the ARTIK itself, but we have accessed it on the network on another machine. If HDMI input/output feature would have been there, we would have ran it locally. But we overcame this challenge by developing our own dashboard from scratch and running it on ARTIK server.Another challenge we faced is with Bluetooth connectivity. Initially we decided to send water consumed data from water flow meters to the ARTIK using ARTIK’s bluetooth. But due to frequent disconnections from the bluetooth we primarily relied on WiFi.We hope that ARTIK Developer community evolves more quickly and more developers start developing their solutions. ', 'We are proud of how we all pulled together as a team, created and tested a working prototype literally from scratch in the short time span. We are proud about all that we have learned in the process and all those late nights of brainstorming which we managed without much caffeine. Sure, there is ample scope for improvements, but the best part is that it proved to us that everything we have thought about and envisioned is definitely possible!  ', 'We have learned a whole new set of skills ranging from building a home to hearing about new terms like MQTT and Mosquitto. We have learned that ARTIK is a powerful tool with immense future. We effectively edited the mosquitto configuration file to listen on multiple ports so we could manage to connect 8 devices (edge devices) to the mighty powerful ARTIK. Working on creating dashboard gave us an insight into the effort required to come up human-centric design that is user friendly and interactive.Data analytics and intelligent cloud management on SAMIIO Cloud enlightened us with the IoT ecosystem and how data can be analysed more lively and intelligent insights can be processed.But most importantly we have learned that our solution has great potential and with teamwork and dedication a lot can be achieved. ', 'Link the dashboards with various Education and Outreach programs that are currently being rolled over in California. After all, learning starts from our homes.Locality / Community based Gamification and introduction of incentives. This will make the water conservation a more social and fun affair.We plan to integrate Ultrasonic sensors with the water pipelines of a street/locality to detect leakages in the pipes and alert water authorities.Making the water flow meters installed in pipes self powered using the flow of the water itself. This will allow to run it continuously without electricity. Develop in-built intelligence to allow ARTIK to take feed from Moisture sensors and compare it with live weather report from internet to make better informed decisions.Potentially collaborate with pipe manufacturing companies to launch new products in the markets which have in-built sensors embedded in them.To test, take feedback, improve and repeat the cycle.

Our talented team includes leaders in transportation management who have vast experience in using software and technology to improve our roadways. While the foundation for this app is already active in several markets, adapting it for this solution took a new approach. ', 'The first challenge we encountered was dealing with limited route options to and from Yilan. The long periods of heavy congestion during holidays are also more significant than what is normally seen in many cities. These limitations actually helped us by forcing us to think outside the box and add a new dimension to our travel-shifting approach. In addition to luring drivers to change their departure times and take new routes, we now also present our users with a list of top destinations that are close-by. In addition to saving them time, this approach goes well with our incentives and rewards program, as we’re able to offer our users a discount to these alternate destinations in exchange for visiting them that day. ', 'Pulling it all off! There was a considerable amount of effort put into this project. To start with, we had to run models and simulations to properly understand and address the fine details of the Taipei-Yilan congestion issue. From there we brainstormed ways to tailor our approach to this unique problem, and once we’d refined our solution the real work began. Plenty of programming and reprogramming (and reprogramming) have gone into this effort. ', ""Heading into this project, we knew that tourism travel is more flexible than the commuter trips Metropia normally targets in urban areas, but even we were shocked by the results of a survey on holiday traffic taken by Taipei drivers. Over 70% of survey respondents indicated that they were willing to travel at a different time, change to a different destination, or both if it meant avoiding the heavy congestion that plagues the Hsuehshan Tunnel. The pain of holiday and weekend traffic to Yilan was resounding, and the public's willingness to change destinations gave us a clear directive to pursue this new feature in our app.Aside from the additional reduction in traffic, guiding people to consider fun attractions around Taipei helps boost local tourism and creates a more vibrant economy within parts of the city that aren't typically seen as holiday destinations. "", ""Our carpooling feature, DUO, is just now reaching the public. We will next look to further reduce the number of vehicles on our roads with multi-modal features that make it easy for our users to take public transportation.

Our back-end was more of a challenge. First we had to analyze the photo we received from the phone. At first, we tried to use an LSTM based OCR processing tool called Tesseract. It seemed to work properly only half the time, so we tried to find something better. The big problem with OCR is that all the good systems are proprietary so we had to go with Azure's OCR offering. It works quite well. After getting the text out of the image we had to process it. We had made an attempt at vectorizing the words we got and tried creating a conditional random field model. The problem is that they mostly ignore the order of words, so it didn't work for us. Something like an LSTM would have probably worked better, but we didn't have enough data and it was outside the scope of this hackathon. So we resorted to designing a hand made tool-set that we used to process the words. Overall from a technical perspective the whole process works quite well.

As a lot of people share apartment buildings, it is indeed more convenient to share gardens than to have their own. ', 'With that in mind, we decided to create a smart garden platform that is meant to make sharing gardens as fast, intuitive, and community friendly as possible. ', ""We use a plethora of sensors that are connected to a Raspberry Pi. Sensors range from temperature to light-sensitivity, with one sensor even detecting humidity levels. Through this, we're able to collect data from the sensors and post it on a google sheet, using the Google Drive API.Once the data is posted on the google sheet, we use a python script to retrieve the 3 latest values and make an average of those values. This allows us to detect a change and send a flag to other parts of our algorithm.For the user, it is very simple. They simply have to text a number dedicated to a certain garden. This will allow them to create an account and to receive alerts if a plant needs attention.This part is done through the Twilio API and python scripts that are triggered when the user sends an SMS to the dedicated cell-phone number.We even thought about implementing credit and verification systems that allow active users to gain points over time. These points are earned once the user decides to take action in the garden after receiving a notification from the Twilio API. The points can be redeemed through the app via Interac transfer or by simply keeping the plant once it is fully grown. In order to verify that the user actually takes action in the garden, we use a visual recognition software that runs the Azure API.

"Marauder mApp V2","A community-based &amp; crowdmapping application that provides a virtual companion to enhance street safety.","[13317, '628,521… was the total amount of reported criminal attacks against students on their way to and from school in the US elementary, secondary & universities campuses on 2014. From this amount, around 40 were murders and almost 170,000 were classified as serious violent victimizations such as rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault [1]. We see these numbers more than a mere statistics but lives that were marked because of an unfortunate event.Also, between 2001 and 2013 on average 4% of students reported being afraid of an attack or harm on the way to and from school. This makes at least 2 million students in the U.S. (plus their parents) likely to be interested in using the application [1].So, how to improve our youngest’ safety? How to help them decide which is the safest path to their destination? Or even better, how to watch their steps remotely?We are living in a dynamic world in which everything is evolving at a very fast pace, even the way crimes are committed. We believe that people’s collaboration can make powerful contributions. Detroiters are already turning this belief into action by releasing the Detroit Strategic Framework Plan which is “a guiding blueprint for transforming Detroit from its current state of population loss and excessive vacancy into a model for the reinvention of post-industrial American cities” (Griffin, Cramer, & Powers, 2014) [2]. So the purpose is to design a community-based & crowdmapping application to enhance public safety by connecting you to a relative or friend by sharing your route so they keep an eye on you. As the security threats expert Marc Goodman puts it: “After all, public safety is too important to leave to the professionals”.Why is this app relevant to Detroit’s needs?Although this is an application for any pedestrian and/or driver located in any city, we identified the following reasons for which Detroit, initially, will be interested in this solution:Public safety is frequently addressed across the imperatives on the Detroit Strategic Framework Plan as evidence of citizen’s priority [3].At the Wayne State University & Wayne County Community College District campuses alone, an average of 87 criminal offenses per year were reported during 2012-2014 [4].There were more than 530 carjacking offenses, 2,600 street robberies and 9,100 aggravated assaults reported in Detroit on 2015 [5].There were 54,483 people involved in 22,833 crashes within Detroit in 2015 [6].Enables citizens to commute anytime and anywhere feeling safer, thus, increase economic growth, as “public safety plays a critical role in supporting economic growth and vitality by reducing the cost of crime and enhancing the desirability of communities as places to live and locate businesses”(Keeling & Cleverley, 2012) [7].Increase continuous improvement by creating a feedback loop empowering citizens participation by monitoring safety concerns within their neighborhood public areas.High people density with tech devices making them target to crimes.What it DoesMarauder mApp enhance security throughout your route (walking, public transport or car) by connecting you to a relative or friend by sharing your route so they can watch your real-time path remotely. It also enables you to foresee any security alerts, street lights that are not working or hazards raised by other active users. Thanks to this you will be able to find the best path with the least dangers.The application displays an emergency button to call 911 and it also features a panic mode which alerts your virtual watcher if you are in trouble (New feature). This panic mode is triggered automatically if you suddenly drop your mobile and/or run or while driving if a car door is opened or the airbags deployed (This feature is not included on the Demo yet). When triggered it will begin a countdown of 5 seconds allowing you to dismiss the alert in case of a false alarm. When driving the alert can be dismissed by a voice command (This feature is not included on the Demo yet). We envision the application to be compatible with smart cities initiatives, such as street lights that are equipped with motion sensors and cameras. This way Marauder mApp can give life to your route by enabling you and your virtual companion to watch your path in advance with real-time activity and pictures streamed from outdoor street lights --- this real-time data version is available on the demo.While driving, Marauder mApp provides traffic data along your route (New feature). This uses the GE Current street light data which provides traffic information such as the amount of cars in your route and the lanes used.What makes this possible?Although Marauder mApp can be implemented with smartphone technology alone, its experience can be enhanced by leveraging car hardware modules (e.g. OpenXC) and city infrastructure such as public lighting technology (e.g. GE Current motion sensors and cameras).The video streaming, pedestrian and traffic information rely on the GE Predix platform and its usage of GE Current street lights. The use of Predix and the GE Current street lights are not the only options to gather this information. Any cameras and other type of sensors with internet capabilities can be integrated with Marauder mApp. For example, the cameras installed on highways by the State of Michigan could be hooked up to provide video (http://mdotnetpublic.state.mi.us/drive).The panic mode feature can be enabled with current smartphone technology. Sudden motions such as the phone falling or a user running can be detected both in iOS and Android devices. The panic mode for the vehicle users can be implemented using the OpenXC platform. Marauder mApp can be connected to the car ODB-II port via Bluetooth allowing the application to extract information from the vehicle such as the doors, airbag status and vehicle emergency codes.MVP Testing Instructions & FeaturesGo to http://godetroit.iamweb.com:3000/Create an account --- you can use fake e-mail if preferred, test@user.com works.Click on ""Create Route’.Input ""365-399 Broadway, San Diego, CA 92101, USA"" in the From text box [a].Input ""1402 K Street, San Diego, CA 92101, USA"" in the To textbox [a].Let the Marauder mApp know if your are walking or driving.Click on ""Get Route"".MVP Demo ExplanationA map will show up displaying the recommended route. The traced path indicates the three GE Current streetlights available as dots. Every time there is activity within the LED sensor’s range a location marker will pop-up. If you roll your mouse over any of these markers, the total count of people in the area will pop-up.At the bottom of the screen, images streamed from the recommended route’s outdoor streetlights will be displayed. Share your route by clicking on ""Share"".If clicked on your cell phone will send the route link to any friend on Whatsapp [b].If clicked on a desktop browser, the share button will copy the route’s URL to the clipboard to be shared as needed.You can click the emergency button which will display the alert message your watcher would see.Additionally, there is a yellow “Panic Demo!” button. Clicking it will trigger panic mode and will display a dialog with a countdown.If the countdown goes down to zero an alert message that would be shown to your watcher will appear.You can click the “I’m okay” button which will stop the countdown and bring you back to your route.You can click the “I need help!” button which will display the alert message.Note a: This is the only route that works on this MVP as the LED sensors are narrowed down to this area.Note b: Whatsapp is supported as an example. Other messaging applications such as SMS, iMessage or Facebook Messenger can be added.What’s New on Marauder mApp goDetroitShare and watch routes not only walking but on car as well.Notify your virtual companion once you have arrived.New panic mode triggered by running, airbag deployment and other events.New 911 emergency button.Gather traffic data from the Predix platform.What’s Next for Marauder mAppCommunicate street light sensors to coordinate traffic lights for a rapid traffic flow.Trigger the panic mode if the user runs and/or drops the mobile.Leverage OpenXC while driving to trigger the panic mode by monitoring the user’s vehicle: Panic mode starts if the vehicle doors are opened or the airbags are deployed.Add a new “I’m nervous” button.  When clicked the user needs to keep it pressed. If the finger is removed trigger the panic mode.Enable active users to share real-time security alerts, street lights that are not working, accidents, and other hazards.Enable virtual companion to recommend pedestrian to change route.Filter streamed camera images by selecting streetlight on the map.Position the pedestrian being watched on the map. (Currently can be done but for demonstration purposes, since there are only 3 sensors in San Diego).How was the Project built?Marauder mApp is built on Javascript with Node.js, MongoDB and the Meteor Framework. This is used to create a lightweight web application that can be executed either on desktop or mobile and that can display information on real time.To display the information the GE Predix platform is used. The project consumes four Predix microservices: User Account and Authentication, Pedestrian Planning, Public Safety and Traffic Planning. GE’s Intelligent Environment Public Safety API service provides real-time and historical images/video from each intelligent LED light installed in a city.Accomplishments we are proud ofThe project is able to trace routes that contain the GE Current streetlights and Cameras as way-points so that the route you take can be watched. The real time sharing of information is really powerful because the pedestrian does not need to have the phone on the hand, and suspicious activity is noted by the watcher, a message or a phone call will make them change the route.Projected Use-CaseAlice wants to go from the University to her house late at night after a long study session. She pulls her mobile, opens Marauder mApp and enters her destination, she then decides to send a request to her friend Bob so that he can keep an eye on her journey home.While Bob makes himself a sandwich, he gets a few pictures of Alice getting outside of the University from his home computer. Dinner in hand, he checks some images from a couple of blocks ahead of Alice. Seen everything looks fine he goes back to his dinner and starts reading a book.Every few blocks the application asks Alice for a notification on how she\'s doing. Bob can look at images from cameras Alice has passed by while he enjoys his evening. (This feature is not included on the Demo yet)After some time into his placid watch, Bob gets a notification to his mobile. Turns out some pedestrian activity has been detected some blocks away from Alice. With a few clicks Bob checks the images from around that area. It looks like a couple took out their dog for a night walk. He decides not to change Alice\'s suggested path and goes back to his dinner.Once Alice gets home she sends a last notification to Bob thanking him for his watch. Bob sees Alice has arrived home safe while brushing his teeth, turns off his application and goes to sleep.ReferencesOffice of Postsecondary Education of the U.S. Department of Education & The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).Griffin, T., Cramer, D., & Powers, M.

From telecom towers, to hospitals and corporate offices and manufacturing facilities depend heavily on Diesel Gen-sets to provide for a power backup. In the as - is scenario, the Diesel generator manufacturers and owners depend heavily on manual scheduled maintenance to ensure that they do not malfunction and continue to operate optimally.  Needless to say a manual process is error prone and inefficient leading to malfunction of the Gen-sets. In the age of Industrial IOT Gen-sets qualify as critical infrastructure and a real time monitoring is necessary. ', 'Most of the Gensets come equipped with a controller that allows us an access to vital information. Lumos uses a device built on Aurdino and Raspberry Pi 3 that connects to the serial port and receives information via MODBUS protocol. The Raspberry PI has a GPRS module that allows it to connect to IOT Hub. The device runs IOT Hub client responsible for communicating information to IOT Hub seamlessly and securely. IOT Hub routes the telemetry received to Azure streaming. The telemetry is also separately stored on Cosmos DB. The visual layer of the application consists of Angular 5 with embedded power BI dashboard which is fed by Azure streaming to provide it realtime information about the Genset in question. Lumos can also be downloaded on iOS and Android devices as native mobile applications. The mobile app provides the capability of viewing the current and historical information about the Genset.

"IoT Fridge Saver","Reduce the consumption of refrigerators by just circulating the air in the rear.","[13507, 'The idea comes from one of the team members, when one day he discovered that his electric bill was too high. This led him to research to find some way to measure the electrical consumption of his house.Found the Open Energy Monitor website. It is a system that allows to measure the electrical consumption using Arduino. This changed everything because he did not depend on third parties to do an analysis of his appliances.Suddenly he looked at the refrigerator, what was happening? This appliance was the most consuming per day in the whole house by far.Investigating more in depth he discovered several interesting matters about refrigerators. But perhaps, the most important was that due to the heat that concentrates behind these devices, their electricity consumption increases between 15% and 25%.This was the seed of this project.How a refrigerator worksThe operation of a refrigerator consists of transferring the heat from the interior to the exterior. This allows the temperature inside the fridge to be much lower than the ambient temperature of the room.If there is not enough place to be exhausted, the hot air that expels the appliance itself condenses in the back, affecting compressor efficiency. This causes a longer time needed to cool and as a consequence, an increase in the electric consumption. ', ""A possible solution is to ventilate the rear through a fresh air flow. This can be achieved in several ways, giving more space in the back or moving the air with fans.But of course, all this makes no sense if we do not have consumption data and temperatures. This is where Arduino comes into play, where we will connect the temperature and power consumption sensors to transmit them to a database in the cloud.Posed the problem and a possible solution, we already had where to start the project.BackgroundBefore I get fully involved in explaining what the project is and how we are developing it, I will put you in a position.There are more than 7 billion people in the world. One in five has a refrigerator in their house. That's more than 1.5 billion refrigerators.This appliance is one of the few that is on 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. This means that each refrigerator consumes an average of 450 KWh per year. If we multiply the number of refrigerators around the world (1,5 billion) and the annual consumption of each, the total leaves 649 million MWh of annual consumption.If we look at it from another perspective, we can state that all home refrigerators in the world consume more than a country like Germany.Source wikipediaTherefore, supposing we could reduce the consumption of all the refrigerators in the world by 10%, we would be saving a total of 64.9 million MWh per year. If a KWh equals 0.62 kg of CO2, we would avoid pouring 42,185,000,000 kg of CO2 into the atmosphere.The mere fact of having consumption data of household appliances, makes your electric bill to be reduced by 10%. As we will see throughout this project, this device can be used for other appliances. This implies that we may have considerable electric bill savings . "", ""The central axis of this project is the Arduino 101. This board takes the Intel Curie microcontroller.It is a small but complete chip. Among its features it has a built-in IMU or Inertial Measurement Unit that has an accelerometer and gyroscope and Bluetooth connectivity through BLE or Bluetooth Low Energy technology.One important thing to keep in mind with this prototype board is that you have to have the most current Firmware possible. This is because what you are actually doing is emulating an Arduino.To update the Firmware follow these instructions.Going back to the initial approach of the project, we must do several things with the Arduino 101. Measure various temperatures, power consumption and control the fans to generate that fresh air flow in the back of the refrigerator.Particularly, we made the decision to measure back side temperature, front temperature, freezer and refrigerator. This gives us 4 temperature sensors and a sensor to measure the electrical consumption.For data collection, we used the DS18B20 temperature sensor and the SCT-013 sensor that measures the electrical consumption.It is not mandatory to use these models, any other similar sensor can be used to obtain the temperature and consumption information.DS18B20 Temperature SensorThe Maxim Integrated DS18B20 temperature sensor offers a temperature range between -55 ° C and 155 ° C, with an accuracy of ± 0.5 ° C.The model we use is the commercialized as a waterproof probe avoiding any problem inside the refrigerator or freezer. This sensor uses Maxim Integrated's 1-Wire communication protocol allowing the simultaneous connection of more than 100 sensors through a single pin.Electric consumption sensor SCT-013To measure consumption, we use a non-invasive current sensor. So we do not worry about having to alter the refrigerator power cord too much. The only thing we have to do is peel the cable and embrace only one of the two power cables, live or ground.This type of sensors are known as Current Transformers and one of the most common is the SCT-013. They operate under the principle of electromagnetic induction. The output of these sensors is an intensity proportional to that which passes through a cable or electric circuit.There are two types of sensors, which provide either a current or a voltage. The same thing you use, but the simplest is the one that offers us a voltage.FansFinally we connect the fans. Taking into account the consumption, dimensions and noise they can generate. We can use any model, but we must keep a close eye on these components since there are different models for different uses and not all are worth.The idea is to be able to adapt the project to use the typical fans of the computers since they consume very little and are very economic. Those who are testing José Manuel and Germán are Boxer Fan type.Connecting Arduino 101 to the InternetAlthough, as I said, it is a very robust and very useful plate, the big drawback is that it does not have an Internet connection. This forced us to look for solutions to send all the information acquired to a platform in the cloud.There are different options like using Bluetooth to connect to another device that has an Internet connection. But perhaps the simplest and cheapest we found was to use a NodeMCU.This development kit is based on the ESP8266 and is very easy to use (it is compatible with the Arduino IDE) and comes at a very economical price and have a library to configure WiFi like WiFiManagerAll logic of the project resides in the Arduino 101 and NodeMCU only makes bridge between the plate and Internet.Send information to the platform in the cloudThe data must be visible in real time at all times. Only then will we verify if the project is viable and we can make the right decisions.As a cloud platform we choose Firebase, then we will detail its features.One of its advantages is that it is very easy to use thanks to the REST API that incorporates. With only one HTTP call we can store the data obtained from temperature, consumption and use of the fans.All of this is sent in JSON format. Therefore, the integration between Firebase and NodeMCU is instantaneous.The Firebase databaseThe features we seek to integrate a cloud service into this project are ease and cost. At present there are many services that we can get to use like Thingspeak, ThingerIO or the Arduino Cloud itself. All may be a good choice.But perhaps because of our experience in web development, we chose Firebase. The first thing to note is that you have APIs for many programming languages \u200b\u200bamong which JavaScript is found.The database has limitations as it is a free account.It does not allow more than 100 simultaneous connections.You have a limit of 1 GB of storage.You have a limit of 10GB of download.With all this, our project after a month of data collection every minute of two refrigerators, we have a storage consumption of 3.9 MB and 158.4 MB of download.Web application for data visualizationWith everything previously mounted, there is nothing left to see the information in a friendly way on any device.If we want to monitor the data in real time, from anywhere in the world and any device, one of the faster options is to create a web application.Firebase has a Javascript API that makes it very easy to integrate a database from this platform into a web page.In addition we added the Bootstrap framework for it to be responsive. We have used an open template for this framework, SB Admin 2.All this has resulted in a website that can be viewed at www.iotfridgesaver.com. It consists of two screens.The initial screen shows a map of Google where we will be locating the different refrigerators that are used.Once you find the one you want to consult, just give the icon and click on info. From here you can access the historical temperature, consumption and use of fan. "", ""There have been many challenges we have faced in this project. First the integration of a board without an Internet connection.We solved this by using a board based on the ESP8266 as NodeMCU. Perhaps there is a much better solution but the simplest and fastest was this.At the time of performing rear ventilation, the problem that we have found is mainly how to make a fresh air flow to lower the temperature.We have followed different phases to decide when to turn on the fans.In a first phase we have done a data collection to analyze the information.They are then manually activated to check what happens in certain situations. This led us to think that the temperature difference between the back and the front was a good indicator of high consumption..However, as we were collecting data we realized one thing. The best time is when the compressor is activated and at the same time the rear temperature increases. It is much easier in terms of programming to control this situation.Undoubtedly, the back temperature is closely linked to the compressor activity.We need to do further investigation, but first tests show that there may be about 20% energy efficiency improvement activating air flow.We checked that, when blower moves air behind refrigerator, compressor activity and inner temperature reduction speed are significantly reduced.Accomplishments that we are proud ofWe are very proud to have achieved a system that is capable of two tasks. On the one hand control hidden parameters of the refrigerators to the users.On the other hand have been able to minimize electricity consumption in certain conditions.At a first stage, asigning temperature sensors to each point of measurement was difficult. We had to check their hardware addresses to identify them and write it into source code. Now, we use temperature differences to identify sensors automatically. This makes easier to setup the system.There is no doubt that there is still a long way to go in this project, but with the mere fact of having all this information we can help people reduce the consumption of their appliances.What we have learnedAbove all we have learned one thing, how refrigerators work. We have detected that in many occasions it is made an abuse of them.Just by applying a few modifications to the installation, we can reduce its consumption. But all this is not possible if we do not have analytical data to corroborate it.This is where open technologies come into play. They give us the possibility to create devices that adapt to our requirements. Without these technologies none of this would be possible.We have also found that there may be huge differences in the consumption of different refrigerators. This project can help identify the most efficient models.Only if we know the world around us, can we change it.What's next for IoT Fridge SaverThe following steps we have planned are as follows:Improve data storage through Firebase. One database per user.Make summaries of the histories to show them in the home.Make historical data private for each device.Change the device settings on the web through a form.Activate or deactivate fans remotely.Conduct a socio-economic study in different countries.Built Witharduino-101bootstrapds18b20firebasejquerynodemcusct-013Try it outwww.iotfridgesaver.comprogramarfacil.comgithub.com      Submitted to    Intel Hacks 2017Winner                Popular Choice                  Created by  One of the most consumed appliances in homes are refrigerators. At times, you can reach consumer peaks that trigger electric bills.It can be due to several factors but the one that influences more is the little air circulation in the rear part of the same one.By circulating a fresh air stream in the back, this consumption could be reduced.

"PowAgri","Your Dream Farming is Now in Your Power Hand","[6114, ""Couples of years ago we tried to develop a project which helps a farmer to choose appropriate crop to improve the crop production as well as the income. But due to the scarcity of data we could not able to develop that app. During that time we survey and talked with some our relatives who are directly and closely related to the farming. We observed that farmers choose a crop to harvest based on the previous couple of years crop production, harvesting cost and price. They choose a crop usually based on information available from the agriculture officer, the memorized data or information collects from their neighborhood peoples. Agriculture officer usually advice farmers based on some text based data. But retrieve useful information from the memorized data or a text based data cannot help a farmer to visualize meaningful information. Also these data set has limited data which is unable to effectively help any decision making process.USDA has several data set which has a lot of agriculture related data. By leveraging these data we can help farmers in choosing and comparing several corps. In PowAgri we leverage the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) to help the farmers to choose the most productive and valuable crops by visualizing data in the most intuitive way. The main target user of PowAgri are the farmers, so they want to use any tools which  can help farmers in the easiest way. We can visualize information by choosing many attributes, but this is not a practical way for a farmers. Keeping this issues in minds we design our app PowAgri which is an easy to use tools to help farmers in their decision making process. Just a single tap farmers can visualize the information and can make appropriate decision using these data.App IntroFarming is the greenest business. Like any other business, in agriculture farm, farmer keep a log of their crops or products productivity like how much they produce, price or harvested area. Keeping this farm logs or data will be worthy, if they can get meaningful information to improve their farm production. USDA also maintains several dataset to keep the agriculture related data. Except the researcher or a text based data is not very meaningful to farmer, because retrieving meaningful information or analysis is very troublesome for a farmer from these dataset. To resolve these issues, we develop a very easy to use app “PowAgri” to provide a meaningful insight to both the farmer and the researcher so that they can visualize all the data in a meaningful way.Key Features:  PowAgri is very easy to use tools for every farmers and researcher to select best crops or compare crops in several attributes. Just a single tap PowAgri visualize data to farmers for helping the decision making process.  PowAgri helps farmers to choose appropriate crops for a particular state based on some farming characteristic like yield, price received, area harvested or area planted.  Farmers can get insight about which crops is the most productive in their surrounding areas.  Compare crop tools helps farmers and researchers  to know which crops harvest better than the other crops in terms of yield, production, price, expense and other several attributes.  Price analysis tools helps farmers to know the market price of a particular crop in a particular state  PowAgri provide the expense information to the farmers for a particular states.Overall PowAgri leverage the USDA NASS data set to help farmers in their decision making process.How It WorksChallenges I ran intoThree years ago we tried to develop an app like PowAgri. But in that time we did not have enough information, as a result we could not complete our project. On the other hand, after seeing a lot of data in USDA datasets we faced a sweet problem: how to visualize the data to farmers for helping in their decision making process. There are several ways we can visualize data by choosing desired options. But it is not very easy way for a farmer. As our main target user are farmers, we spend a many many hours to design the UX of the apps. We studied a lot of survey, reports and agriculture guidelines to design our app. We also spend a lot of times to determine which information is very important to the farmers so that they can use this information to improve their farming. But at the end we successfully mange and visualize these to the user in the easiest way.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofAt the very beginning of the PowAgri development process, we were afraid that how to manage these huge dataset and how we can visualize these data to the farmers so that they can use this tool without any headache. We spend hours and hours to simplify the data visualization process. We spend countless hour and design a lot of wireframe to develop an user friendly UX and data visualization.

With our variety, we analyzed certain basic aspects (below) which led to the inspiration.Deluge of mails & managing is an herculean taskDisparate tools used to manage your team, activities, tasks etc. & they work in silosEmail is main media of communication & is not effectively used in projects Tools like MS project etc. are expensive, steep learning curve & does not trickle to the last team memberWork transition is a fixed handicap which normally consumes lot of resources## What it doesU@Work is envisaged to be a simple and light weight project management solution on top of Office 365 Outlook platform. So, from the email window, with intuitive user interface and menu options, Users for example can define project work elements, meetings, tasks, allocate resources and also track progress from a rich visual Dashboard.U@Work Creates a folder structure (as that of a Project WBS structure) across the team & any correspondence with respect to a specific project/activity/ will be routed to the recipient project/activity in the same order. Tasks can be associated to projects & activities, people can be assigned to activities and tasks, meeting action items can be tracked and health of projects monitored with data & metrics providing insightful infographics auto-rolled up to the Dashboard. This automatically adheres to ISO & COBIT.Task & Meeting lifecycle Management.Real time dashboard on various status of Tasks / Action items.Works on Office 365 & Outlook.com.A Patent Pending product, presently, U@Work is being realised as a product add-in, integrated to work with Microsoft Outlook Office 365 and Outlook.com email platform.Some of the project management features realised so far are; Manage Work: Users can create, manage by directly defining project, activities, sub-activities etc. and assign people to a project, activities from within the context of an email in Outlook. Allows multiple project creation and can be managed from user interface and monitored from Dashboard.Dashboard: U@Work add in provides a dashboard view where the users can view metrics of project summary, task status, meeting metrics and Gantt chart.Team on Same Page: Manager shares project details to team members with a single click. The sharing happens via email being sent to people whom activities, sub-activities etc. have been assigned.Auto-Organise folders: On receipt of first project email, similar project (folder) structure as configured by Manager will be created in every team member’s mail box automatically, thus bringing uniformity in structuring project & communication across team, ground up.Auto-Organise project emails: From UI, when any team member sends email with context set by selecting Project, Activity, Sub-activity etc., emails get automatically routed to respective folders in the recipient’s mailbox. Communication is organised ground up and saves effort and time.Manage Tasks: From UI, create tasks against project, activity, sub-activity etc., and assign to any team member. Team members can update task status and the data is rolled to Manager and dashboard.Manage Meetings: Covers elements such as invite, calendar, meeting minutes, track outcome, mainly decisions and action items. Meeting metrics are rolled up to dashboard.Resources: From UI, Team members can notify their non-availability, example leave, vacation etc. This detail is rolled to the Manager and also routed to the respective project folder and metrics updated in the dashboard.Note: For installing U@Work add-in on Outlook 365, side load the Manifest from the URL which is given in ""Try it out"" section below.

The APIs and plug-in integration approach is not the same and varies from provider to provider. This can be analogous to developing an application with same features and user interface to run on different operating systems.Getting to depth, The APIs and plug-in development and integration approach between Microsoft Outlook desk top version and Microsoft Outlook Office 365 is totally different. For instance, MAPI is used for Microsoft Office desk top version, which is different from using the latest & evolving Microsoft Graph technology for Exchange & Office 365, which is again different from using web hooks provided by Outlook APIs to directly interact with Outlook as part of Office 365.Plug-in technology is also evolving and not exercised by many so far. Initially, while examining feasibility options, lot of time and effort went in, even to make samples work. Also, lack of documentation aggravated the problem and debugged to figure out missing pieces and discover remedies. For example, first instance to make U@Work visible in the email window was a significant effort. Next steps to process user actions, when clicked, were no different.U@Work requires to interact with user mail box and email exchange server. As Microsoft Graph is also evolving, very few APIs are exposed limiting functionality that can be realised. Also, had to experiment a lot, due to insufficient technical documentation and usage examples. Another uncertainty is to battle possible changes to APIs, as they are still in beta and not released to production. Already faced a situation once, where change in API syntax broke U@Work. Presently, we use a combination of both Microsoft Graph and web hooks for Outlook APIs.Emails can arrive to any mail box at any point in time.

So, to synchronise and process in real time, (even when users have not logged into the mail box and U@Work) a separate service was built to run 24*7 to run in the background.With Microsoft Outlook Office 365, mail box can be accessed from popular browsers such as Internet Explorer, Edge, Chrome and Microsoft Outlook desk top versions (2013 & 2016). When it comes to user interface, size and form factor of the dedicated pane exposed for plug-ins to render varies between browser and desktop email clients. Also, there is no feature parity yet between browser and desktop version. For example, in case of Outlook desktop version plug-in can appear in the main menu bar.

"UPTEAMIST","A simple intranet platform for small and medium businesses","[4584, ""Our team has been an Office 365 / SharePoint consulting service for the last four years. We began to notice that small and medium-sized businesses were continually asking us for the same features: an Intranet platform that is simple to manage, able to quickly create content, and easy to use by people of all skill sets. Considering the short adoption rates of platforms such as SharePoint, we decided to provide a different experience that helps SMBs better adopt O365 and leverage all of its feature.What It DoesUPTEAMIST allows teams to quickly create and share announcements, pages, links, documents, and events. Additionally, users can manage permissions and tags so that content is always readily available to those who need it. The UPTEAMIST platform integrates directly with Office 365 so that team members can use their enterprise email addresses to access the system and start sharing instantly.How We Built ItUPTEAMIST is built on Azure and integrates with Microsoft Graph API, SharePoint REST API, and StripeJS. A Node.js application manages the subscription platform, while the user-facing portal is built on .NET with AngularJS. We have been working on the project since March 2017.Challenges We EncounteredAs UPTEAMIST integrates directly with SharePoint, most of the challenges emerged as we worked with the SharePoint REST API. For example, in the case of a document upload, UPTEAMIST needs to contend with not only its own built-in permission system, but also SharePoint's permission system. To effectively handle this, we needed to ensure that the permissions set on UPTEAMIST were mirrored in SharePoint.We had many internal discussions concerned with how to best simplify the interface and the actions provided to end users. If we made it too simple, the platform might not have enough features to make the service useful. If we made it too complicated, we figured we might as well just continue recommending SharePoint. With the issue of balance in mind, the design team went to work - and continues to adjust and update - to ensure that we are providing the right amount and type of features to our users.AccomplishmentsOverall, we are very proud of the work our team has done to get the platform up and running. The connection to Azure AD is working great, as is the connection to Stripe to manage subscriptions and payments. As of this application's date of submission, already two dozen alpha users are on the platform and providing us with insightful feedback.What We LearnedAs an agency that provides consulting services, we had to re-learn processes and procedures from the product development perspective. Although the design, development, and quality control methods were roughly the same, much more thought needed to be dedicated towards marketing, customer feedback, and support. We want to ensure that our product answers a community need, and that new feature requests are realized and implemented quickly. Our goal is to improve the tool so that it perfectly fits the needs of modern, small to medium-sized organizations.What's Next for UPTEAMISTFor the remainder of 2017, our plan is to continue to work with our alpha - and eventually beta - users to refine our product features. Our product road map for 2018 is arranged into quarters. In the first quarter, we want to move UPTEAMIST out of beta and into V1. The second quarter will be dictated by the feedback we receive from our initial users, and it will include the implementation / integration of Project Online and Dynamics CRM Online. The third quarter will include rolling-out an iOS / Android application developed using Xamarin. In the fourth quarter, we plan to work with the Cognitive Services API to integrate speech recognition so that users can interact directly with the Intranet via voice command.A quick introductionhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/EL4uo8tZ6LUBuilt With.netangular.jsc#graph-apinode.jssharepoint-rest-apisignalrTry it outsubscription.upteamist.comwww.upteamist.com      Submitted to    Hack Productivity 3    Created by  I contributed as the product manager and ensure of the progression of our first feature set and respect of the timelineKhoa Quach "", ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['graph-api', 'node.js', 'signalr', 'sharepoint-rest-api', 'c#', 'angular.js', '.net']","False","77","['quachhongak']","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/542/610/datas/small.jpg","True","9"

Front-end only frameworks tend to grow in popularity much faster than full-stack frameworks because there are so many developers with legacy apps that want to update the UI without rebuilding the entire app.A hosted service is good for an API provider who wants to provide a DDP API without doing more work, it can be thought of like a proxy. But a developer who wants to consume a REST API might not want to go through a hosted proxy and might want to be able to subscribe to REST API's directly within their app.So we would like to extract the core functionality into a package so that any Meteor app can easily subscribe to a REST API and receive live updates over DDP.

One day I had to move from one place to another in my city, normally I took me about 15 minutes but that day, the traffic was crazy and took around 55 minutes. That day I realized that the congestion was mainly caused by the people in their cars, because around a 90% of these were occupied by only one person. As soon as I realized that, I started to work next to a group of friends in these project so that we could promote a more sustainable mobility. ', 'Wheels is a social network for mobility, where members offer and demand routes with their friends or colleagues to share their cars, taxi services or bicycle plans. Thus, in this network users can take, for each route, a role: passenger, driver, taxi sharer or cyclist. This social network is a platform that serves to enable people to share their vehicles, taxi services or bicycle plans for its recurrent trips such as going from home to work or college and vice versa routes. However, unlike the various initiatives of carpooling in the market, we guarantee to the users conditions of safety and security because people never interact with strangers, but with known people of confidence from three main groups: friends (Facebook or friends who are in your contact list), colleagues (the university or work, can interact by having active institutional mail) and contacts (private groups for neighbors, private groups for people doing sports on weekends, etc). Thanks to Wheels cars, taxis and bicycles in the cities can increment the occupancy rate because the more we promote initiatives like carpooling, more people will start to shift their mobility patterns to start a new way of travelling. Also, we are aiming to work next to transportation agencies so that they can use our data to generate solutions in the cities. ', 'Wheels was created using the most advanced technological tools on the market (digital maps, mechanism digital confirmation of the information, algorithms to match, etc.) to offer a service that aims to improve the welfare of the society. In that sense Wheels operates for each of the different existing operating systems on the market (Android, IOS (iPhone), and in Web version. Thanks to the Wheels design, you can create a route specifying how much are you willing to walk, how much time will you spend traveling and how much CO2 are being saved by the users thanks to the use of Wheels. ', 'The challenges Wheels is running into are to massify our services in all the cities around the world, especially in the cities located in the emerging countries because it is there where there are big concerns with the mobility.

', 'We have learned that the most important thing to promote carpooling in an emerging market like Mexico, you must guarantee safety conditions to the users so that they feel motivated to interact and share their car, taxi services or bicycle plans. ', 'In Latin America, the economic growth in recent decades has led to a sharp increase in the rate of motorization, which has not been offset by the expansion of road infrastructure. This imbalance is heightened by the fact that during peak hours about half of the vehicles are mobilized with a single passenger, and cars generally move with a low use of installed capacity. Indeed, more than 400 million empty chairs in vehicles moves per day in the region. This allows to explain that the average speed of journeys has been reduced by about 50% over the past three decades in the main cities of the region. As a result, mobility has become a major economic, political and environmental problems, since in a manner harmful impact on productivity, adoption of public management and air quality.Looking ahead, this the mobility would worsen in the emerging economies since the planned expansion of the road infrastructure will not achieve the motorization rates significantly stimulate by this 3 causes: i) a sharp increase in global urbanization rates from currently 50% the population inhabiting the cities to 70% by 2030; ii) a significant increase in per capita income and iii) an acceleration in the transition to single-person households. Knowing that the problem will increase and that emerging countries are increasing the connectivity to internet and the access to smartphones, from Wheels we believe that there is a lot of potential out there to be reached.However we believe that technological products like Wheels will change dramatically the industry and will change the experience of the commuters.

"BUSSI","The van sharing platform for commute. We create crowdsourced routes, to build reliable on-demand transportation.","[4425, 'A year Ago in August 2014 I decided to join Mexico city and its entrepreneurial environment. Working in an innovation technology center (CTIN) and spending the rest of my day in communities for programmers and hackers (as DEV.F). trying to figure out a pain that most of people suffer and it’s funny because being in this city for 6 months is easy to think as normal spending 2 to 3 hours in transportation for join the office if you use a car, near to 1.5 to 2 hours in public transportation that is not comfortable, secure or even safe. That’s when I realize the pain I was looking for was there “A lack of quality in public transportation service over Latin America (not just Mexico)”. Transportation should be easy, affordable, comfortable, trustworthy, safe and customer first. That’s how the whole idea of combining on demand routes with Van sharing comes up.  ', 'Bussi is a transportation network that gives the possibility to transport groups in a Van, linking people with same routes. we make dynamic routes based on traffic behavior and people destination. Through a platform that gives unique user experience to people who wants to move between hard dense urban points to jobs and principal places in main cities with a mobile app. Our goal is to give an affordable cost service atmosphere with help crowdsourcing and on demand service. ', 'First we create a website where people share where they want to go, which days and what time. Then we make a city heat map and start to propose where the route should exist, the most voted route is the one officially opened. Finally the route is integrated to a very simple mobile application where users can see the Van in turn, check schedule and reserve a seat. ', 'There are so many challenges in starting a product, first and one of the most importants is Team. Bussi needs the right team right now we are a small group in deliver what people wants. we are probably not complete yet but we are still working on it.Second thing is convincing Van owners to try Bussi model, is a hard task we are accomplishing step by step, also we need to have user demand and making growth so both Van owners and users might be satisfied. This is probably a very common challenge in two sided markets.Third is cultural shock, most of people in cities like mexico city are custom to own a car but carpooling or van sharing is something they don’t understand at first, as well people thinks spending 2 to 3 hours in transportations services that lacks quality and safety. So comming with a solution that changes the game in order to penetrate these markets takes a while. ', 'Since very beginning Bussi has been well accepted for must of people, which make us strongly believe we are in the right path to something interesting. Also we have been present in important events like web summit 2014 in dublin.  Back in Mexico we have been part of Posible 2015 an event for entrepreneurs where we also provide a transportation service for more than 150 people. And currently we are working with dev.f in Mexico city to transport around 120 group of people. And now we have more than 450  active users in the last 3 months.

The key for us is traveling with our customers, see what they care for and keep going with what is important. everything else is a distraction. for very specific points, safety and economy is what most of our users care more. Also in case of b2b model, the way to organize events to move big groups of people is what matters. ', 'We are currently serving users with a couple of routes, with a very small mvp. To scale is necessary to improve our application, the way people join and ask for a route which also means to have more Van owners and reduce cost.

"BANANA viva Yilan","provide better driving experience by an android app","[5955, 'For many Yilan residents, the easiest and the quickest way to travel to Taipei and other parts of Taiwan is via Freeway No.5 and through Hsuehshan Tunnel. But the huge demand for the four-lane highway has resulted in heavy congestion, especially on the weekends. For a quicker, safer way home for all Yilan people, we propose a different toll collection system based on the current traveling speeds on different segments of the highway, the slower the speed, the higher the toll rates, thus encouraging drivers to travel through alternative routes when the highway gets too crowded. When the speed on the highway falls below 30km/hr, we set up the toll rate to be as high as 12 times of the original! We believe this system can effectively reduce the amount of vehicles entering the highway whenever a congestion occurs, thus raising the overall travel speed on the highway. ', 'We strive to come up with a solution that\'s not only feasible in theory, but also functions well in real life, so constructing an app for all android system users has always been our main goal in the project. After analyzing the traveler needs, we developed this solution app called ""UWay"". the The user can install UWay on their mobile phones and look for the traffic information of Freeway No.5 anywhere, anytime. Besides highway information, we also provide other traffic website links and traveling information of Yilan. The UWay app has six main functions:Road Condition InquiryHere, the app shows the synchronized traveling speed of six segment on Freeway No.5. The exact speed in km/hr is provided, with corresponding traffic status ""smooth"", ""average"", ""congested"".Travel Time EstimationThe traveling time in each of the six segments is provided. The user can add up the total travel time based on the sections he/she will travel by clicking on the ""checkbox""s of each segment.  Travel Cost EstimationThis function pre-calculate the travel fees on the six segments of freeway NO.5 according to the traffic fluctuation. We set the base toll rate at 1.2NTD/km, and the rate varies with the travel speed. The different rates are shown in the following: Travel speed  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Number of times of the original rateover 70km/hr \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0           X160~70km/hr \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0             X250~60km/hr \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0             X340~50km/hr \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0             X530~40km/hr \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0             X7below 30km/hr \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0         X12The system can also add up the total cost depending on the sections designated by on the user.Other LinksThis part of the app provides the links of other websites containing traffic information all over Taiwan. This may be very useful if the driver decides to take alternative routes to Yilan.Travel InformationThis link will direct the user to the Yilan official tourism website, providing local transit information and other upcoming tourist events.Incidents reportThis is a feedback function for travelers to instantly report back to the system on the current traffic status or road incidents.For further details please check out our demo video.How We built itWe divide our team into two groups responsible for programming and promotion video editing/web page managing.The app: developed by MIT app inventor 2.Travel speed data: Government database.App icon, menu icons: created through Illustrator and Photoshop.Animation: created by Photoshop with timeline function. App demonstration: operated on an android phone.Post-production: Power Director 14.Challenges I ran intoAfter we decide to reduce congestion traffic flow by raising the section toll rate, the first challenge we encountered is to determine the travel speed interval and the corresponding toll charge( how high should the charge get?). It took us a lot of discussion to finally set a 10km/hr interval and an increasing 2,3,5,7,12 times toll rates. Based on personal experiences, we all agree that the current toll fee is too low to force travelers to take different routes. A maximum 12 times of the original rate should be enough to compel most divers to take other roads.The second big problem is the data source. We encounter difficulties trying to directly download the instant speed data from the National Freeway Bureau website, so instead we focus on the downloadable Freeway No.5 traffic data of April, May June of this year(2015). We analyse the data provided by 157 cameras over the three month period first by removing the false/unreasonable data and then averaging the data during the same hour of every day, and finally locating the cameras closest to the current toll gates and use their data as reference speeds. Overall, it was a very time-consuming process due to the large amount of data.Accomplishments that I\'m proud ofAs a group as students, we\'re very proud of the fact that we created the ""UWay"" app all by ourselves!

"Kickback","Effortless, fire-and-forget Amazon refunds when prices change","[3144, 'Amazon has a policy stating that if a product you buy from them has a lower price within a week of your purchase, you are entitled to a refund of the difference. Unfortunately, many aren\'t aware of this policy, and even if they are, it goes unused as it\'s a real hassle to do all the required legwork.Kickback is something that people could and should actually use.  A few days before LA Hacks, I bought a scooter. Just yesterday, the price dropped $10. Because the application hadn\'t yet been built, I had to go through the ""traditional"" process of verifying what I\'d paid, checking the new price, finding the dates to see if I was eligible, and finally the tedious task of contacting Amazon. This experience made me realize how needed this product was.Kickback has literally no downsides to the consumer, and offers huge potential upsides.How it WorksUsers log in through Google in our mobile application (or soon via a webapp), which also serves as a beautiful list of pending and successful refunds. We check your Gmail Inbox for new Amazon orders, and watch for fluctuations in price. If something drops (monitored via Amazon\'s Product Advertising API), not only do we recognize that you\'re owed a refund, but we also send an email on your behalf (from your account using the Gmail REST API) to Amazon, requesting that the difference be refunded to you.Your only interaction with Kickback will be to sign up once, and then receive push notifications whenever we\'ve saved you money.AccomplishmentsWe\'re pretty happy to have made a simple way to passively take advantage of a great policy that you may not have known existed. In terms of technical achievements, we were able to build a relatively scalable MVP in a short amount of time; we organized worker execution with simple in-memory schedulers that could probably handle hundreds or thousands of users as is.We also made a really pretty app.What\'s next for KickbackThis service could be very easily scaled; as more and more people automatically monitor products and get refunds, request overhead goes down due to overlap.

"EDDI - ElectroDialysis Desalinator for Irrigation","Removing the salt effects of drought catastrophes. One ion at a time.","[6442, ""When we first joined the hackathon, we began by researching the various large-scale changes that happen during a drought crisis and how they affect the humans and ecosystems that are susceptible to changes in water abundance. We began with California but wanted to keep an open mind about how this may apply to other parts of the world where drought is an issue. We quickly found that drought caused far more changes than just a simple shortage of water: it was responsible for an increased salinity in groundwater and quicker soil runoff rates, meaning the water that is applied to the soil doesn't stay put. This poses a major issue for farmers who have to resort to overwatering, which becomes increasingly expensive, and less efficient with a decreasing water supply. Additionally, farmers see a decrease in crop yield when their plants are in a saltier soil. "", ""We decided to give farmers another option: remove the salt before they irrigate. With this option, farmers can use electricity to separate the salt from their water, allowing them to use only the water that they need to grow their crops at the maximum yield they can achieve.In short, we built a desalinator for individuals, and it's called EDDI. EDDI is an appliance. Its size makes it perfect for smaller farms, and it connects into existing utilities. EDDI is scalable. Simply add more layers and voltage, or chain two devices together and you can increase your desalting capacity.EDDI is intelligent. You can control it and monitor it from any internet-connected device in the world. With the EDDI web application, you can easily visualize your water's salinity, and how much salt is being removed. You can even download a spreadsheet to analyze your groundwater and plan for your next year. "", ""We used a technology called Electrodialysis, where an electric field is used to separate salt ions from neutral water. This technology uses a series of water channels separated by ion exchange membranes which allow only a certain kind of ion to pass through them. We designed and built our own stack of these channels and membranes as well as all of the plumbing and circuitry that goes into controlling the flow of water. We also built circuits for introducing the electric field into the desalination stack, and switching the polarity of the stack in order to prolong the device's lifetime. We also integrated salinity and flow sensors to detect the state of the device.The Artik acted as the brains and communicator for our device. We utilized almost every GPIO pin of the Artik (it has a lot!). We used a C program with unix sockets to monitor the sensor readings, and we used Node.js to control the circuitry. We used Firebase to store and read our sensor readings and user settings in real time. We designed and built a custom web application for the EDDI. The application is entirely a frontend app made with React.js. The app is designed for ergonomic use and ease of understanding. We've provided an easy way for farmers to visualize and understand water salinity, which is not an immediately intuitive idea to grasp. "", 'As with all hardware projects, what we built took a much longer time than we anticipated. We ran into several roadblocks along the way in all parts of the process.During circuit building, we were just learning how to use transistors, so we tried many circuit designs and blew many transistors before we were able to use them correctly. During the mechanical design, our biggest difficulty was preventing the device from leaking. There were many points where we had to drastically change our design in order to prevent leakage. We also had difficulty in figuring out how to cut the materials, but eventually found a few methods that worked really well. ', ""We didn't electrocute ourselves!But seriously, we are all so proud that we were able to pull all of our individual contributions together and make a device that works the way we set out to make it work in a very limited amount of time.

"APP+Website台灣雪隧疏流","We build a real time and potential software to help both residents and official to reduce and control car flow. ","[8899, '   According to ""Impact analysis of transportation capability by speed limit in xueshan tunnel"",the loading capacity in hsuehshan tunnel is 2400 car numbers per hour, but now it often over 5000 car numbers per hour. The car flow in highway greatly exceed the capacity, which cause serious traffic jam. To solve this problem, there are two aspects that we can do. First, reduce the car flow in traffic. Second, control the traffic flow in hsuehshan tunnel. The detailed information is as followed.1. Reduce car flow   In traffic transport industry, modal switching is a great way to decrease traffic flow. However, there are several disadvantages to ban users from these methods. For example, it is too inconvinient. Users have to search buses, trains and all kinds of public transport ways and they even have to find out how they move whey they are in Ilan. The result is they just give up and drive their own cars. Besides, people don\'t know what they get if they switch other modals, such as, how much time or money they can save. This is a huge problem because bus can afford 5 times of people compared with private cars. To sum up, we want to be a platform that resolve inconvinent problems. We will collect all kinds of information they need and provide some discounts to add incentives. These can encourage people use public transports system and alternative ways to reduce car flows.2. Control car flow in highway   According to  ”Franks Self-organized lane formation and optimized traffic flow in army ants,” if the car numbers per hour exceed 3000, the traffic jam will naturaly happen. We have to control the car flow to prevent natural traffic jam. Reservation system is a good way to control and estimate the car flow for concerned authorities to make further decisions. We can distribute the flow and warn people the expected jam. If we accumulate enough data, we can even give more information to residents. Thus, we want to distribute the flow into reserved lane and normal lane in some serious times like holidays or weekend. Buses and people who reserve on our app can drive on this lane (like high occupancy vehicle lane). Peolpe who want to save time and don\'t follow the rules drive on reserved lane. We will punish them with the help of eTag and License Plate Recognition System.    In conclusion, our idea is using carrot and stich approaches. On one hand, we encourage and make it easier for residents to use public transport ways. On the other hand, we strictly control flow on highway and give severe punishment who want to save time and break the rules. These income can use for subsidy of local residents. ', ""We are a software that are useful for both people transports between Taipei and Yilan and concerned authorities. For people transports between Taipei and Yilan, they can easily grab needed information and compare all ways in our app. For example, they can see which way is faster and cheaper now. Besides, we even provide discounts and booking system in our software. We can give some incentives to seduce them using public transport system. If they want to take the bus, they can book it immediately; if they decide to drive, they can reserve for reserved lane. They can use our services with app and website anytime anywhere.   For concerned authorities, we are a real time supervisory control system. We can collect how many people book for reserved lane and they can make further modification. For instances, if they know around 2000 cars will influx into the system, they can distribute the lane or even suggest some users set off earlier with our serivce. They can also combine it with eTag and  License Plate Recognition System to get some important parameters or charge higher with these users. We can control it better but not like now depend on police officiers' instinction.In conclusion, we are a two-way solutions for users and officiers. There will be a synergy effect if we can connect users and officiers with our services.   "", 'There are three stages we do.   First, data collection, including Field research, collection of scientific papers and so on. We visit Ilan to observe the problem for over 5 times. Besides, we interview 2 professors who know transportation information industry throughly and read over 20 papers and articles.   Second, policy development. We discuss for over 10 solutions like lower interval, combination with OpenXC and so on. We discuss with more than 10 local residents to make sure find out a great solution.    Third, software construction. We write a ""real time"" app and website. In front-end, we first draw manuscripts and discuss UI/UX for 2 weeks. In the back-end, we host a server in Amazon, and run a NoSQL database.  We build a real time connection with web socket that can change information immediately when the database change. We also developed a web crawler to crawl information from official websites.  ', 'The largest challenge we met is how to apply theory into real world. We are students from transportation management and chemical engineering and have some experences in software development. We have to figure out the problem first and apply what we learn in class to solve the problem. It s really a great challenge because real world is not that easy. For example, we want to apply transport formula to calculate capacity. However, the turbulent system do not follow the parameters. When we personally observe in the highway, we found that many parameters are wrong in real case. We concurred a hard time to find out a solution with support of theory.    ', "" We really involved into this project and challenge ourselves. In order to solve this complex problem, we not only investigate it from several aspects like transportation management, policy, chemical engineering, software and psychology, we also run through almosot the whole process of a product's develpment. For example, although we study chemical engineering, we tried to use the knowledge of fluid mechanics into solving this complicated traffic flow problem. We thing out of the box and solve the problem with Interdisciplinary cooperation. Most important of all, as a resident in Luodong, we can solve our own issues and help the society is a great honor! "", ' First, we learn that to solve a huge problem, we have to combine all kinds of professions. Only with cross-border cooperation, we will earn the opportunity to deal with tough issues. This project encourage us to learn more and build our professions to help the world be a better place with our strong abilities. Second, of course, we realize more about Hsuehshan Tunnel and Ilan. We are more connected with our mother land. Besides, scold is easier than construction. We should not scold the government or others because it is really difficult to construct a good policy or solution.  ', 'The logic will not change. Reduce or control the car flow in highway. First, we think that goverment should have a stronger execution. For example, raise the road toll is an effective solution but goverment do not choose this because afraid of lossing the vote. For another example, high occupancy or reserved vehicle lane is also a great solution that many cities use. I think the goverment should be bold! Second, if talk about help with technology. We believe, combination of wisdom mobile system and big data are the future. For example, interval is a really critical key point in solving traffic jam, if intelligent system can automatically control interval between cars, the problem will greatly solved. For another example, with the help of big data, we can predict the car flow and make furthr decisions like distribute car drivers into several differnt times. Last but not least, we think local goverment should do more about local public transport system, many people drive their own cars but not buses because they think it is too inconvinent in Yilan.

"FeelsChat","Twitch chat sentiment analysis for streamers","[5261, 'I have been wanting to get my feet wet with extensions for a while and this was a really fun experience. I thought it would be fun to try to build an at-a-glance twitch chat analysis tool for streamers and viewers alike to see the general mood of a chat. ', ""In essence the application is a chat monitor that performs analysis using some javascript and the AWS Comprehend NLP engine. The once the streamer has the extension open, it will begin to read chat, submitting 2 minutes for processing. Once results are received, the extension will show:Sentiment AnalysisUsing Comprehend, the overall sentiment of the last 2 minutes of chat. The UI shows an emoji consistent with the chat sentiment and some text on the sentiment return. As a note, emojis are excluded from analysis as they may skew the results. Under the simple at a glance sentiment there is a small line graph showing the sentiment of the session in relation of positive sentiment score, the higher the point, the more positive the chat was, this can be expanded in future iterations.Profanity PercentageThis card will show the simple percentage of lines that contained profanity. Again, emotes are excluded from this list to avoid skew. Unlike sentiment analysis this is a running percentage for the session. The anaysis is a regex filter that looks for common 'bad words' and makes the occurrence per line. The measurement is the percentage of chat messages containing at least one bad word.Repeated LinesThis simple comparison is also a running percentage of the number of repeated lines in a segment. Emotes excluded again this is a very simple text comparison. In future iterations I would hope to be able to take advantage of a better (and cheaper :)) text analysis tool to better compare text lines for similarity.Emote SpamThis simple calculation shows the percentage of chat lines that were emote only and contained more than one emote. No hard calculations here as I am able to grab the emote tags to determine if emotes are present and how many and this becomes my counter. "", ""The front end of the extension is built using react. There are 2 main views for the application, the broadcaster's live dashboard and the panel portion of the channel page. On the dashboard the view will execute the polling of the broadcaster's chat and will submit collected chat lines every 2 minutes. The analysis of the chat is centralized to a lambda endpoint that is hit with a POST request. This endpoint will first verify the JWT of the caller and then break off into the 3 major analysis threads. The sentiment analysis is an API call to Amazon Comprehend with an array of chat lines with emotes redacted. Additionally, there are 2 node functions that will complete the analysis for profanity and repeated lines. Once all 3 have completed, the lambda will broadcast a pub/sub message to all connected clients. Once the clients receive the messages, they will update the UI to reflect the information. Another note is that the dashboard will persist the information for the session, meaning if a client comes into the stream late, they will still receive the most recent information, thus keeping all clients in sync. The analysis data points are also kept in DynamoDB for future analysis and trending tools for streamers.  "", 'Getting up and running with the developer rig was somewhat challenging as this was my first foray into the tool. After some getting used to, it turned out to be a great resource. I had worked with Lambda and AWS quite a bit in the past but working with the comprehend API was another learning experience with this project. The biggest challenges I ran into were performance at scale. I wanted to make sure my pack size and response sizes were small so this could scale up. I made some major architectural adjustments to account for performance as well as some potential issues with pub/sub limitations.  ', ""In all honesty just having an extension that is functional and does remotely what I set out to do is something I am very proud of. This was a 'nights and weekends' project for me and I loved working on it and learning about extension development. "", ""I learned a ton about twitch extensions in general as well as some of the inner workings of amazon machine learning APIs. I learned about the twitch API and how twitch's JWT validation works. There was also a good amount of performance tuning and webpack config fun that was a good experience.  "", 'In the short term I would like to expand some of the available information including potential new measures of chat. As mentioned earlier, I would like to expand the text matching capability as well as to add some information around key words and phrases. Finally, trending over time is something I am very keen to expand.

"Chat Translator","Open up your stream to a global audience and break down language barriers with real-time translated chat for viewers!","[7030, ""Chat Translator started out as one of the many open-source Twitch-integrated projects I build live on stream with viewers at the Coding Cafe as Instafluff because I had viewers from all over the world that could speak Czech, Spanish, Dutch, German, and even Japanese but were limited to chatting in English. We created ChatTranslator the Chatbot and turned it into a global Twitch bot and it currently resides in 112 different channels and has translated more than 47 million characters since September 2018. I wanted to take the lessons learned from the chatbot and make it much more natural and integrated with less chat-spam for my community and others as well, and Twitch extensions were a perfect way for me to make it happen.DevelopmentI am a huge AWS fan and have used many of its services for almost a decade now in my own startups and in consulting for other businesses as well, but if not careful, it can get expensive. Chat Translator is a showcase to how, with the good architecture, AWS can be extremely cost-effective for even the penniest of the penny-pinchers.The Chat Translator extension was built using the Twitch ComfyKit with HTML/CSS/Javascript and its backend was built using NodeJS and ComfyTranslate running on the smallest instance of AWS Lightsail, which is a flat $3.50 / month, and one of these instances using the smart-caching system I built for the translations in combination with the $15 / million characters pricing of AWS Translate APIs should be able to currently handle hundreds of small/low-activity channels, about 20 medium-sized (~50-200 viewer) channels, or one really large channel for a total of less than $20 of overhead per month. With further development of the caching and language-detection system, this operating cost could be even lower. When done right, AWS can really make tight budgets go a long way.Technical ChallengesThere are several significant challenges that Chat Translator overcomes that might not be as obvious at first.Keeping the translation API calls budget-friendlyScaling real-time translation of active chat to multiple languages at the same timeHandling Twitch Emotes in the translation processSockets and real-time broadcasting of the translated message to viewersListening to Timeouts/Bans of users and broadcasting the deletion of corresponding messages.Designing to look like the familiar Twitch chat with status and sub badges, username colors, showing emotesAPI Limits & ScalingThe precursor to this extension, the ChatTranslator Chatbot, was already pushing the limits of a 15 million character monthly quota when I began working on the extension for this challenge. I made several improvements to the caching system because this extension may translate to 5 languages at the same time in a single channel so that I could keep the API costs low.The extension connects to the translation server via web sockets, but automatically connecting every viewer to the server will overload it quickly, so I made adjustments to also keep the connection count low and only translate languages as necessary.Twitch Chat QuirksTwitch chat messages are not normal text. It includes emotes represented as reserved keywords and replaced at render-time to images and translation APIs do not understand the emote names and often comes back broken. Chat Translator specially handles the quirks of Twitch chat messages in the translation process in order to preserve the meaning of the original text.Also, when a user is timed-out or banned from a channel, all messages from that user in the chat's history is deleted. Chat Translator is able to listen for these events and react as well.Lastly, in the native Twitch chat, users often have badges reflecting their role in the channel or a special status, such as moderator/bit-cheer/subscriber/etc. including channel-specific badges. Chat Translator's design keeps these badges and other aspects of chat intact so that they do not lose any social value or cause confusion for the user compared to the native chat.Chat Translator's FutureEven with the smart-caching and other systems put in place to help keep the API costs low, it is still a significant operational cost for one person and the bit monetization model doesn't necessarily fit well. After the challenge, I may look into a subscription model to be able to cost-scale the extension, but really the Chat Translator experience makes much more sense directly integrated into Twitch.I believe that Twitch is a truly unique platform because of its social aspect and is strengthened by the connections made on it, which becomes even clearer at events like TwitchCon where people who have only met through the platform can meet in-person for the first time and still celebrate their long-time friendships. This is one of the reasons I love Twitch and believe that Twitch and all of the streamers and users on it would greatly benefit if they could expand their audiences and their social circles beyond language barriers.If this extension were to win the challenge, among other things, I would like to spend the time with Twitch leadership to advocate for its native integration into Twitch before one of its competitors do.Built Withamazon-web-servicesaws-translatecsshtmljavascriptlightsailnode.jsTry it outchattranslator.instafluff.tv      Submitted to    Twitch AWS Extensions ChallengeWinner                Third Place                  Created by  Pizza and coffee fueled the development of this extension.

We chose the “xsalsa20-poly1305"" encryption scheme because it provides great security with fast processing and “TweetNaCl” because it’s a small, auditable high-security cryptographic library.Decryption requires BOTH a master key (stored as a property of a JIRA issue) and individual keys that live on Team Secrets servers.

Initially, we used simple daily emails to gather individual status summaries.As a logical next step we built a prototype responsive web app. Seeing the upcoming Atlassian CodeGeist competition we prepared the web app using AtlasKit and React.

"Penyusuar by  Penyu Ranger"," in order to save sea ecosystem, we cant miss a single part of it. #saveTurtle","[5462, 'Sea turtles demonstrate the ultimate lesson of ecology – that everything is connected.Sea turtles are a part of two vital ecosystems: beaches and marine systems. If sea turtles become extinct, both the marine and beach ecosystems will weaken. And since humans use the ocean as an important source for food and beaches for many kinds of activities, weakness in these ecosystems would have harmful effects on humans.Though sea turtles have been living and thriving in the world’s oceans for 150 million years, they are now in danger of extinction largely because of changes brought about by humans. If we alter the oceans and beaches enough to wipe out sea turtles, will those changes make it difficult for us to survive? And if we choose to do what’s necessary to save sea turtles, might we save our own future? (credit : www.bonaireturtles.org )one of the threats for sea turtles is egg poaching, During the nesting season, hunters comb the beaches looking for nesting females at night . Often, they will wait until the female has deposited her eggs to kill her. Then, they take both the eggs and meat. unfortunately the number of egg poaching are increasing every year, in Sangalaki, a small Island in Indonesia, this case increased by 120% compared to 2013. a local intitute, Yayasan Penyu Laut Indonesia (YPLI) said that almost 1200 egg are stolen by poacher per month in Pasemut Island during a nesting season.Sea turtles have played vital roles in maintaining the health of the world’s oceans for more than 150 million years. These roles range from maintaining productive coral reef ecosystems to transporting essential nutrients from the oceans to beaches and coastal dunes.this case successfully made our heart sink, so we hope this little tool we made can help out to ensuring sustainability of sea turtle\'s life. It is the right time for us to protect sea turtles and rebuild their populations to healthy levels as a vital step in ensuring healthy and resilient oceans for the future.The Problem, and The Solution we offerEgg Poaching is one of the major causes of Sea turtle Extinction. Since it happened a lot in Indonesia, then it become our responsibility to stop it. as a Computer Science student, we believe that by creating a Tool  and a System that could Initialize and start a Crowd/community based movement to protect Turtle\'s egg from poaching can do a little help to prevent Sea Turtle from Extinction.How it worksThis Penyu Ranger (Sea Turtle Ranger) Project consist of the tool, and an android app. we called the tool as ""Penyusuar"" (inspired from Mercusuar, an Indonesian Language for Lighthouse) made of Raspberry pi, a proper web cam and PIR sensor. this tool was built to help Rangers (a name we gave to those who volunteered as turtle conserver) protect eggs from poacher, it can detect if there are threats around the nest of turtle\'s egg. we divided the threats into three conditions, condition one, if there\'s predator(animal) around the nest Penyusuar will play a dog-barking sound to drive away the predator. condition two, if there\'s human around the nest our tool will define them as a threat or non-threat, if they\'re considered as a non-threat our tool will only detect their faces and upload it to our dropbox. and condition three if Penyusuar define the human as a real threat, if they approaching the nest and stay there for a certain distance and amount of time our tool will upload their faces to dropbox (as suspect) and inform all rangers  via SMS so rangers can make sure if there\'s a real threat and take care of it. The android app made to help rangers in order to manage the Penyusuar (located in each turtle nest) it will record the data of the Penyusuar installment including coordinate of the nest and Penyusuar location(automatically added), date of installment, number of eggs on the nest and the species of the turtle. this app will also give a reminder to the rangers on the 60th day since the installment that the egg is about to hatch, so Rangers can move the eggs to the conservatory and perform a semi-natural hatching. within our app rangers can manage Penyusuar record, show it in a Map, view uploaded photos, and also give rangers a statistical information about the number of threats per day shown on a chart.Challenges we ran intohow to help Turtle Conserver against Egg Poachinghow to develop a system that can save turtle from extinction.Accomplishments that I\'m proud ofWe can work in pressure, and also in teamWe can contribute to save turtle from extinctionWhat we learnedWe learned that in order to save sea ecosystem, we cant miss a single part of it.

"Hermes Managed Tire Services - an ioT enabled business","Mileage pricing for Truck Tires supported by ioT. Cents per mile, not $per tire. Increase Fleet productivity.","[10683, ""Internet of Things primarily makes granular information more accessible in real time. However for ioT to take off, we need to show case the technology within a business scenario that can generate a multi-fold return on investment, so that the technology adoption can take off. Business CaseInformation availability in real time alone doesn't add value, or may not add sufficient value to justify the costs and risks associated with an ioT project. To get around this we researched industries and where a combination of an innovative business model that could be executed only through the availability of real time granular data.We looked around for business situations where the availability of granular information can add substantial value. We found that in the after-market automotive care. We further narrowed down the industry to only large trucks and only one part of the truck which is the tire. Tire manufacturers carry very high levels of tire inventory and so does the channel. We analyzed a few companies and found that the inventory holding was in billions. A good example was Good year Tires which had 10.5 Billion sales with over 2.6 Billion in finished goods inventory. The past three years were in the 2.4 to 2.6 billion range as well. The cost of holding inventory in this industry seemed to be between 40% - 55% according to our analysis. This meant that the carrying cost was over a billion dollars and cutting even a small percentage of the inventory will translate into a multi-million dollar cost savings. We created a business model that is based on usage inspired by Amazon Web services. AWS has allowed businesses to pay for IT infrastructure based on their usage. We realized that we could replicate this for a completely  different industry. When customers pay based on usage, their incentives are usually aligned with that of the Managed Service Provider.To align the incentives of the Fleet managers with the managed service provider, we created a usage based billing model for Fleet management. While initially the model will be a simple cents per mile model, more complex measures could be derived that would provide an incentive to the managed services provider to continue lowering the running cost per mile of a truck as long as they get a share of the cost reduction. Solution ArchitectureThe AWS solution architecture is shown below  Business NameHermes is the greek god for roadways and is also considered to be associated with Merchants and Luck. We therefore named the business  Hermes Managed Tire Services  Aligning IncentivesThe Fleet Owner or customer wants to maximize the miles and uptime on his trucks as they are a proxy for his revenue. The managed services provider also has the same metric thus aligning the incentives of the supplier and customer.What it takes to Manage a fleetManaging a fleet of trucks means minimizing the downtime, optimizing the fuel efficiency both of which depend a lot on tires. The business model we are proposing is inspired by the Amazon Web Services but to revolutionize the fleet management and make it a mileage based pricing instead of pricing it based on tires or specific parts.A fleet management operation wouldn't worry about what the condition of tires are and will pay the managed services company on miles traveled.  "", 'A managed service business of this kind would need to maximize the tire usage without affecting the truck downtime. To do this we will use AI based predictive and forecasting Models that predicts when the tire wear is likely to happen and then create a preventive maintenance schedule. The tire wear prediction engine going into the future is built on top of an IOT sensor base which collects data from each truck every second or minute through out the day including mileage, Truck load, Temperature, picture of the road, Tread depth, Tire pressure. Using this granular data, windowed aggregates are computed that include velocity of the truck, acceleration events by level, braking events by level, tread wear per load miles, road condition category from the picture and then computes the expected wear of the tire for the next week and if any of the tires need replacement. This data is then aggregated at the fleet level to calculate the number of tires that require replacement in the coming week, create a maintenance schedule for these trucks and then send the maintenance schedule to the fleet management company. ', 'We designed it in such a way that all of it could be run on AWS with a complete serverless architecture. Since real time data from the trucks was essential for the demo, we built a data generator that simulated a fleet of trucks each with a serial number and initialized them with mileage. To reduce costs of course we only put one truck per customer and had two customers/fleets and initialized the customer data.We  simulated a set of sensors providing the tread depth at sub-millimeter resolution that is inbuilt into every tire. Each tire on the truck has a unique identifier that allowed us to track the mileage, tread wear at the tire level. The tires also had a position indicator to indicate where the tire is installed on the truck (steer wheels need to have more tread than the rear wheels).Accrued Mileage was collected from the truck every second. We used Kinesis Analytics to calculate various features such as average velocity, acceleration, deceleration, braking events, rate of tread wear using rolling and tumbling windows. ', "" Hierarchy of Things Our use case demanded that each truck was a thing which had some sensors as well as there were some things that were connected to the thing in this case tires. Ideally we would have registered the things in a hierarchical fashion but there is no such capability in AWS IOT.To accomodate this challenge we introduced an edge device. We tested a raspberry pi connected to multiple sensors getting the data and persisting on the raspberry pi and then syncing the data. This introduction of edge device was also helpful in building a more tolerant logic that could live with network failures. Issues with Kinesis SQL It took us time to understand the syntax for Kinesis sql. The Kinesis SQL syntax was unlike general SQL and took  a little bit of learning Curve as the Kinesis SQL was case sensitive. Lack of Logging Kinesis SQL  application doesn’t provide any log in Cloud watch. This meant the only means for testing was through trail and error when the application didn't work as expected. Debugging the Parsing Errors Kinesis SQL parsing error messages were not very intuitive so we needed to perform some trial and error on sql queries before figuring it out. API Throttling Errors Within AWS we ran into issues when we tried to analyze images using Rekognition at a high throughput and encountered API throughput exceptions. We requested for throughput increase to ensure that the lambda pre-processor output was working. "", 'The architecture was completely serverless.We used ioT, Kinesis, Lambda and Rekognition extensively. An entire business model managing multiple fleets of trucks and charging for tires by the mile could be scaled up with very limited changes to the design. We did face some issues like API throttling, but we eventually overcame those. ', 'Learnt a lot about tire engineering, available sensors, tire life, factors involved in tire design, tire features for different types of trucks and their usage profile. Played with raspberry pi and tried to integrate data from multiple sensors. Finally for the demo we simply created a simple data generator that could create data coming from all of the tires and at the truck level in a single json which would have ideally come from an edge device residing on the truck. ', 'We ran the numbers and we believe that making the managed services business into an insurance which covers all types of truck maintenance with a truck uptime SLAs would become extremely viable. Once self-driving trucks start hitting the road the variable labor cost is eliminated making the transport miles per truck per day a priority. Currently limited insurance products are available for trucking companies and building these SLA guaranteed insurance products can be hugely profitable for both fleet management and insurance companies.  Currently the Geo-location parameters are not being obtained, but having GPS feed would also give the location of the truck and can be used to integrate weather information. The sensor data in this project generated from the trucks, when combined with the GIS data and fuel consumption can be extremely valuable for tire manufacturers, especially their product engineering team. It will give them the ability to custom design tires for different geographies and load characteristics.  Packaging the data and selling it to manufacturers can also be a valuable revenue source.Extend this information exchange all the way to the manufacturer so that they can manufacture in small batches only the required number of tires and build a connected supply chain. Tire manufacturers have high levels of inventory close to 3 months of inventory and any decrease in inventory can add to the bottom-line. We estimate that if Goodyear Tire was able to reduce their inventory by 10% they would be able to add an additional $105* million dollars to their bottom-line.  We are reaching out tire companies, after market dealers and other industries where usage based billing would be of great value, giving companies the incentive to create products that can improve usage value of the product.* Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GT/balance-sheet?p=GTassuming a carrying cost of 40%.

"Fireflies","We connect people that want food delivered with others already at nearby restaurants using the Alohar Mobile SDK","[6580, 'We are college students that recognize the value of using our time efficiently. We want to empower students to make money while helping their peers. In essence, we see the college campus as a dense network of people who can share resources and time to create a powerful community. Fireflies is our way of redefining the sharing economy on college campuses.  ', 'My friends and I often stay up late at night for exams. We miss out on eating dinner, and after midnight, ordering food is no longer a possibility. At the same time, there are numerous students that are out and about at that time. They pass by restaurants, grocery stores, or even coffee shops. Using the Fireflies app, I can request a meal from Taco Bell or any other local restaurant that does not have its own delivery. The app leverages the Alohar API and notifies someone inside the restaurant, passing by, or just around the corner. With the granular details Alohar provides, our algorithm quickly matches students requesting food with people in the vicinity of that restaurant. Once a match is found, the transaction for the food goes through and Fireflies escrows the money using Braintree. Once my peer brings me the food, the payment is released.  ', 'We built Fireflies with Alohar as a native Android app from scratch for the very first time this August. We aimed to leapfrog off of other existing solutions, and accordingly we integrated several APIs and material design strategies to really vibe with our users. Additionally, we tinkered with delivery ideas in the past and created mockups and surveys to understand user behavior. However we never were able to build a comprehensive solution till now. Until we found Alohar, there was no good way to efficiently track our users and develop a context specific algorithm to enable delivery. We are excited to release this app, complete with designs based off actual user feedback, Alohar integration, and payment systems. ', 'One non-obvious challenge that we ran into while building Fireflies was that our users really didn’t know what to expect when we did user testing. The idea of our app was originally much broader, and we gave users lots of control in the app to to order anything and get it delivered anywhere. (One use case was getting problem sets handed in by peers for their classes). We left a text box for the users to enter what they needed and how much they’d pay. However this was challenging in that the users didn’t know what to put in the text boxes, and if they did, they didn’t know how much to pay. We solved this by eliminating user inputs and giving them a few options with predetermined prices. The app became much smoother, and we noticed a visible improvement in user happiness. This sort of standardization required that we do a lot of work on the backend. When we integrated locations and routes along with pricing, we needed to automate the process to be extremely precise. Alohar provided the information we needed and helped us apply it well within the context of the problem we were trying to solve.  ', ""Getting the most out of the Alohar API is something we are extremely proud of. Alohar provides us with insights on where a user's home location and work location could be. We use that data to extrapolate where the user is going. By taking into consideration several contextual nodes such as time of day, user's past transactions, direction user is heading, and other deliveries being done at that moment, we create optimal matches that saves buyers time and money. In the same way, we optimize routes for deliverers so that they can make the most money possible and complete several deliveries in one go.  What started out as a simple hack ended up providing convenience for people ordering on the go. The app is also a quick and efficient way for other student to make money without going out of their way. Our team is extremely proud of the fact that we can bring people together, empower them to earn, and provide this instant convenience at the tap of a button. We have placed a lot of attention on a seamless user experience. The way we integrated the Alohar API drives our real time, context-based deliveries. Compared to other conventional food delivery applications, we save time and money for the people who order. Likewise, we are extremely proud of nurturing a community where people can mutually benefit from helping one another. In many ways, we are reinventing the traditional supply chain of ordering and delivering. Thanks to Alohar, we were also able to build on existing user behavior rather than forcing users to change what they do and where they go everyday. We are proud of championing Fireflies as a seamless convenience that makes communities stronger.  "", 'As active entrepreneurs, we are constantly hit with an abundance of advice and strategies in creating a product. However, we have found that the only sure way to absorb this advice is to actually go out to the market, talk to our target audience, reflect on our own experiences as potential users, and iterate based on the data we collected. We have obtained insights that we never could have gotten from listening to people speak. We have a persistent, never-give-up attitude and are excited to launch Fireflies equipped with Alohar at college campuses around the country.  ', 'We will launch Fireflies at MIT and Drexel for Fall 2015. As we scale and gain traction we will expand to other schools in Boston and Philadelphia. Our goal is to reach a certain number of daily transactions at each campus we launch at before expanding. We will want to build a rating system and partner with nearby restaurants to make ordering food even more convenient. A long term vision we have for Fireflies is to expand to other communities on a global scale. We see communities that are well connected among neighbors, friends, family members, coworkers, and more. Colleges are a starting point, but we want to keep building, pivoting and tailoring this service to empower different communities across the world.

', 'Our main aim of the project is to control the flow of water using the Samsung Artik board. Since a large amount of water is wasted in terms of sewage, our idea is to use this water filtered in our kitchen garden so that water can be used for growing crops.

Our system also allows to connects multiple users and share their crops over the internet. A marketing system allows the users to sells their crops over the website.

Since we are working on the different parameters of crops, and a large number of crops had alot of parametric data which had to be accounted for. Since we live in India, it hard to go over the authenticity of the facts of California, and this made it quite a time consuming process for us.

So, when we heard about the hackathon, about the amount of data provided by VDOT and Smarter Roads, we as Computer Science students knew it right away, that we can contribute to this cause and decided to come up with a Machine Learning model to predict the number and the type of crashes. ', 'In this design we used 789,914 car crash records to build a performance judging system to analyze the cause of each car crash and predict the number of car crashes on a particular road in future.To do this, we build a classifier and a regressor with machine learning techniques. The classifier was built on the crash records dataset using the Random Forest algorithm.When user, inputs the road features and real time conditions (like weather, time, etc..), 2000 estimators work to evaluate the possible cause of this crash.While the Classifier tell the user about the type of the predicted crash, the Regressor tells the user, the number of predicted  car crashes in the future on a particular road.To build the regressor we cleaned and refined all the datasets and created a new dataset which records the crash and road statics of roads in Virginia. The regressor was built using linear regression algorithms. When user select the road and give the forecast weather in the next month, the regressor will return the expected crash numbers that will possible happen on this road in the near future.Challenges Team ran into:We collected a huge amount of data from the websites and combined several datasets, but still, we were, in need of more data to refine our model. Most of the data was raw data which need to be cleaned. To deal with these problem, we found several open database from the local government and ran statistical analysis on those data and create our own datasets.What Team learnedWe learned an enormous amount about the traffic conditions in the state of Virginia !We learned a lot about data analysis and team working. We are excited about the future of autonomous driving and smarter roads and believe the future of AI and IT techniques in transportation.What’s next?We have built our classification model and regression model and made a web application for it. In the future, if we get more data, we can refine our model and predict more accurate analysis and predictions.

Users can paint unconstrained with 81 colors.","[5950, 'Many artists, professional or amateur, struggle with getting their ideas to the public. Innovative technology such as virtual reality (VR) brings a new set of options to these artists, making the opportunities to express themselves limitless. With VR, the artist’s room becomes his or her canvas where the artist can explore his or her ideas boundless. VR revolutionizes how the artist creates and sees his or her artwork and allows he or she to be himself or herself, respectively.The goal of this project was to develop a VR painting app that creates a comfortable, calming environment to create artwork and improves the quality of life of the user. Specifically, the app targets users who like to draw by improving current technology available to the users. The app includes features such as a 360˚ canvas, an extended color palette and brush selection with activation by a controller, and the option of undoing strokes. The app supports the idea of VR painting by also giving artists who have limited mobility the chance to create works of art once again. VR is a medium where there is an equal chance for all kinds of artists to create art. It is an environment where users can explore their creativity and imagination. This app is designed to give a chance to all who dare to try it. ', 'The 360˚ canvas allows the user to paint anywhere he or she wishes to with just a tap of a button. The user is able to paint anywhere he or she is able to see. This ability unlocks possibilities of painting on the sky and ground, creating no boundaries to stop the user’s creativeness. The app also allows the user to paint unrestricted with the aid of multiple color palettes and brush types otherwise not found in other free commercial available options. With 81 possible colors and the ability to change opacity, depth, or size at the swipe of a button, the user’s options to paint with are limitless. Undoing is a simple feature that requires a press of the app button. One press undoes a part of the stroke whereas holding it erases the whole painting, allowing the user to start on a blank canvas. ', 'The framework of this app is from the github repository android-sdk-googlevr. Code that relates to setting up the VR environment, initiating sensors on a Daydream ready phone, and enabling the controller handler events are all from Google Inc. Additional elements added such as extended color palettes, different brush types (opacity, depth, size), erasing, and saving are created by Varnika Sinha, Sarah Dogar, and Cameron Harvey.Android Studio was the app development environment we chose to work in. We coded the app in Java and C++. ', 'We had some problems with saving. At first, we tried saving it as a 360˚ panorama, but there is no available technology in the phone capable of taking a screenshot in the VR headset without an external camera. Then, we tried saving the vectors created from the strokes in an input file, which would be stored internally on the phone. When the user wishes to access the painting, the file would be read into the app. ', 'We are proud to master such a new technology. The Daydream was released last November, and the developer tools were released this February. In such a short time, we have created our own piece of technology without any help of apis or apks. ', 'Most of the group did not know C++ beforehand. The software used, OpenGL, is coded in C/C++, which required the developers to learn it. We also researched a lot of about the current technology with VR. ', 'An additional feature that could be added in the future is the ability for a user to animate their creations. The animation feature would require the implementation of a frame-by-frame painting process.Another additional feature that could be added is user art-sharing. Users of the app could visit other artists’ galleries and view the paintings they have created. Paint by head tracking allows even users with physical disabilities to experience the joy of painting in the comfortable, calming environment of VR. The option of activating paint options with voice command prompts also opens doors to those who are unable to access or use the Daydream controller. We decided we will also expand this app to other VR headsets and launch this app on Google Play.

"AVGS (Active Vision Guiding System)","Drive with active light guide for best speed and safe distance in tunnel","[9838, 'Hsuehshan Tunnel is the best road for connecting Taipei and Yilan. However there is always traffic jams which increases the driving time on holidays. This proposal focus on eliminating the factor of traffic jam to solve the problem. From our experience of getting stuck in traffic jam, the car speed is usually slow when entering a tunnel, and gets higher and higher when approaching the exit. Why?  There are three main reasons we have concluded as follow: People can’t always keep driving at the same high speed because of the difference speed information showing on the dashboard between different cars. People have difference concepts of safe distance for driving. Improper brake slows down the car speed behind and causes the chain reaction.That is, if all the drivers can drive at the best speed with a suitable safe distance, the rate of traffic flow in tunnel can be higher. As a result, how to guide drivers respectively to drive at the best speed with an appropriate distance is the main purpose of the proposal.雪山隧道是目前台北與宜蘭往返中，最便捷安全的路線。然而，此路線在假日常常造成堵塞的問題，使得行車時間大為增加。本提案提出一種可行且有效率的方式，根除造成堵塞的因素，解決雪山隧道塞車的問題。從我們自身的塞車經驗觀察到，通常進入雪山隧道時的車速很慢，但漸漸靠近出口時，速度越來越通順。探究其主要原因，是車輛沒有保持最高速度前進、或者不當的剎車動作，造成後方連鎖反應。因此，如能讓所有車輛在安全前提之下，能保持最佳的前進速度，隧道的車流量可以達到最理想的狀況。然而，最困難之處在於每輛車儀表顯示的車速會有落差，加上每位駕駛主觀認為的安全車距皆不同，因此如何導引每位駕駛至最佳的""車速""與""車距""，是本提案最主要的目標。 ', 'Considering the expanding ability of equipment for cars and the adaptability of new technology for drivers, it is not easy to build a new system on cars. For example, it is inconvenience to update old vehicles or make all the drivers learn new technology devices or new APPs. The efficiency will be decrease much if not every driver take part in the system. Considering the compatibility for all the vehicles and drivers, and also the driving environments of tunnels are simpler than those of other road types. We design a simple vision guiding system which is able to be installed in the tunnel. This system can provide clear information to guide all the cars moving at the best speed with appropriate safe distance between vehicles. It is the best solution we think! We call it ""AVGS” (Active Vision Guiding System)考慮到車輛的設備擴充能力，以及駕駛人對於科技方式輔助的適應能力，直接建構在車輛上的控制方法是較為不易的。例如，老舊車輛可能有升級擴充的困難，或者部分駕駛人不習慣使用新的科技配備、手機APP等，若無法使所有駕駛人都參與紓解塞車的系統，效率會大打折扣。考量到車輛與大眾駕駛人的相容性，且隧道相較於普通道路，是單方向、不可隨意變換車道，相對單純的環境，我們提出一種可建構於隧道本身的視覺導引系統，直接在隧道增加一個簡單直覺的駕駛導引方式，讓每位駕駛可自然的參考視覺指示，維持在最佳的車速和車距狀態，我們稱為主動式視覺導引系統""AVGS (Active Vision Guiding System)""。 ', 'First of all, we set sensors along the tunnel. The sensor can be IR, light sensor, radar, supersonic or others which can detect the passing vehicles. Second, we set LED array on the road. Lastly, a host computer calculates the car speed depend on the sensor signals and drives the corresponding LED array. The LED array can be a vision symbol, indicating the drivers respectively and reminding them of making some adjustments if they need.The LED indication will move with vehicles and change types depend on the driving condition: Green arrow - You are moving at the best speed (90~100km/h) with an appropriate safe distance (E.G.30~50m) range. Twinkle Green arrow – The speed is too slow, please speed up. Red arrow – The speed is too high, or safe distance is too short, please slow down.PS: the ideal speed and safe distance range can be modified by control center.首先，將感測器(可以是雷射/IR/磁感/光敏電阻/超音波...)裝設於隧道沿線中，藉以偵測移動的車輛。其次，於路面中間沿線鋪設LED符號，最後，利用上位的電腦或PLC裝置，根據回授訊號，即時推算出每台車輛的速度與距離，並驅動對應的LED陣列。LED陣列為一個視覺指示符號，並且各別地指引駕駛，若駕駛行為需要做調整時給予提醒。這些LED將會隨著車輛移動，並根據不同的駕駛行為給予不同指示:車輛在最佳移動時速(如90~100km/h)與車距範圍(如30~50m)內，保持恆亮綠色箭頭。若車速過慢，綠色箭頭會持續閃爍提醒駕駛人加速，直到正確車速後恢復恆亮綠色箭頭。若車距過近或超速，箭頭顏色會變成紅色閃爍提醒修正，直到正確車速後恢復恆亮綠色箭頭。PS:行控中心可依照當下路況動態調整各種參數範圍。 ', 'Since installing the system in tunnel will use lots of sensors and LEDs, it is an important consideration to decrease the cost with reasonable effectiveness. At first, we have evaluated and tried various kinds of sensor, some cost high and some need more time to develop. Lastly, we think the photo sensor is a relatively low-cost and good functionality choice. In practical application, the response time of sensor must be considered to be able to precisely detect the car speed which is over 100km/hr. Because of the large amount of LEDs, it is necessary to select reliable drivers to keep the constant lamination and stable. Moreover, the system has to deal with a lot of information of moving cars, so the hardware core needs good ability of parallel computing such as CUDA. It is also a good way to use multi control units to handle some information respectively, and the host computer or control center will communicate with these control units to monitor the whole tunnel. 因需鋪設許多感應器與LED，如何降低成本又能達到效用是很重要的考量點。起初，我們評估、嘗試了很多種不同的感測器，不是成本高就是開發時程較長，最後我們實測發現，光感測器的方式是相對成本較低，但又保有功能性的好方案。實際裝設時感應器的種類選擇很重要，反應時間需考慮近百公里的車速。由於隧道中的LED數量龐大，硬體需要搭配可靠的驅動器，以維持恆定亮度，並提升穩定度。此外，因為須同時處理大量車輛移動的資訊，核心控制硬體需要較強的平行運算能力，可使用CUDA架構，或者使用多個區域控制核心進行運算，最上位的監控電腦或行控中心蒐集所有資訊後，再進行全隧道的監控。 ', ""It is a very simple and clear way (vision guiding system) to solve the traffic jam problem in the tunnel. 這是一個非常單純且簡潔的方案(視覺導引)解決隧道內塞車的原因。The system can be built in tunnel directly, so it's compatible with all vehicles and drivers. No need to learn or update any equipment. 系統直接建構於隧道本身，設計與運作環境單純，不需要駕駛學習操作且通用於所有車輛。Provide sufficient messages to each car, minimize the factor of traffic jams. 針對個別車輛的問題給予個別指示，將塞車的可能因子降到最低程度。We have designed the software in C, and the control logic is able to be transplanted to larger real system in tunnel with little modification. 我們用C完成了軟體設計，控制邏輯僅需部分微調，是可以移植到真實的隧道系統中。 "", ""To find out the effectiveness of the system installing in tunnel, we have driven   to the tunnel many times. We believe the LED icon should be placed on a noticeable position without distracting the drivers. The best location is the front ground of driver. That can make driver not only concentrate on the driving situation but also notice the LED icon. 為了得知系統放置於隧道中的效果，多次開車進入隧道，我們認為視覺導引圖示出現的位置需要在明顯但不容易使駕駛分心的視線方向，最佳位置為正前方稍遠地面，讓駕駛在專注前方車輛與路況時同時可以感知到提醒。The type of LED icon was discussed and modified several times to make drivers understand quickly and easily. 視覺提醒的種類，經過多次討論將數量降到最少變化且使用清晰易懂的設計。There are many types of sensors, considering the cost, response time and developing time after some tests, finally we choose the best solution so far - photo sensor. The photo sensors can be applied in real tunnels. 感測器的種類繁多，經過多方嘗試後，考量到成本、反應時間、開發時程等等因素，選擇目前最佳的方案-光感測器!此感測器可實際應用於真實隧道中。What's nextDifferent types of vehicle would activate different numbers of sensors, the software have to take it into consideration. 不同車種的長度將會遮蔽不同數量的感應器，背後程式需要可以判斷差異There are lots of dynamic data updating at the same time, so the reliability verification of software and hardware design is required. 實際隧道內會同時產生大量動態數據，軟硬體設計與運作可靠度需要驗證How to transplant the prototype to the real application in tunnel? A PLC or an industrial computer can be used as the control center instead of the ARM microprocessor. By using communication way like RS485 or Ethernet, the control center controls the LED drivers and local control units which sense the sensor signal and calculate the car speed. 未來將如何移植原型系統至隧道的應用之中呢? 可以使用可程式邏輯控制器或工業電腦取代原型中的ARM微處理器。藉由通訊如RS485或者Ethernet的方式，行控中心控制LED驅動器以及下位的控制單元，這些控制單元將各自處理部分的感測器訊號並計算車速。In the future, the AVGS system can be implemented with big data based on the traffic information over the years. According to the current time, car quantity or other factors, establish an algorithm to calculate the best traffic flow in the tunnel and give a best car speed command to control center or host computer. That way, the effectiveness of the proposed AVGS can be the best. 未來將可與大數據做結合，由數年來的交通資訊，根據目前的時間、車輛數等各種因子，建立出即時隧道的最佳車流量的演算法，下達最佳的車速命令給行控中心，將可以將系統的效能提至最高For real application, the installing location of LED is flexible depending on the professional study of user interface and difficulties of construction.實際隧道內系統燈號安裝位置可以經由更專業的使用者介面研究與施工可行性判斷後微調。Working sample DemoSince the actual system installed in tunnel will be too large, instead we develop a small prototype system with the same control logic function. We use 15 LED array to arrange red arrows and green arrows. The sensor we choose is photo sensor which is really cheap and effective. Each sensor is put next to each LED arrow, and it will be triggered when the light is covered by the passing car. Besides, we also design hardware including the driving circuit for LED and interface circuit for sensors. The control unit we use is ST Microelectronics STM32F3 discovery board with ARM Cortex-M4 CPU, and it is developed in C language. The system structure is as the following diagram. This prototype can truly accomplish all the functions of this proposal, and also simulate the control center to change the car speed command by using the knob.

"RAMEAR","We can get data out of your computer wirelessly - even if you don't want us to!","[5039, ' ', 'RAMEAR is combination transmitter and receiver designed for transmitting signals outside of standard computer interfaces. The inspiration of RAMEAR comes from the following GSMem paper  presented at USENIX.We have taken a standard Ubuntu PC, and managed to wirelessly transmit data from it - even though the PC has no Ethernet connection, no WiFi and no Bluetooth.This is accomplished by bashing the Data Bus of the computer - the main communication avenue between the RAM and the CPU of the computer. We use a special assembler instruction to transmit 128 bits in parallel to the RAM, bypassing the cache. We repeatedly run this instruction to transmit random data over a period of 500ms, effectively increasing the radiated RF power from the bus substantially.A ‘1’ transmission in our system corresponds to a period of high activity on the Data bus, and a ‘0’ transmission corresponds to average activity. On the receiving end, we calculate the amplitude of the signal and process it [5 stages] to decode the waveform. We developed the transmission system from scratch in order to fit our needs, including both developing noise rejection code ourselves and automatic clock synchronisation. ', ""On the transmission end, we used standard hardware to emulate a wall-gapped-system, potentially inside a secure facility. We wrote some low-profile code in C which hits the data bus at its maximumum frequency - on this computer, approximately 513Mhz [that's 513 million 128-bit transactions per second]. The code has a very low memory footprint [as it writes to the same location continually], and also has a very low CPU footprint - as the memory frequency is much lower than the CPU frequency.On the receiving end, we use a python script to process the RF data from the bladeRF. During the course of the hackathon we developed our own transmission protocol, and our own algorithms for automatic clock resynchronisation and noise rejection. In order to reject noise, we did have to maximise the transmission period, such that our data rate is approximately 2 bits per second. However, for an example use case of transmitting a 512 bit secure key from a remote air-gapped computer, this only takes 4 minutes to transmit, which we consider reasonable. "", 'We get noise from the frequency channel of our RAM. We had to do a lot of signal processing to reconstruct the data we send to our RAM.The main challenges were involved with the RF processing (we had no prior RF experience) and decoding of the signal. We are dealing with extremely noisy data with no synchronising clock, and therefore the decoding algorithm was complex. However, we are comfortable with how it performed at the end - in several tests it managed to transmit 40 bytes consecutively without a single error.   ', 'Actually managing to make it work was a challenge - especially when it came to data decoding. The data decoding automatically resynchronises the clock on high quality pulses, and then relies on this timing when the signal becomes worse in quality. Secondly, the system automatically keeps track of the high and low signal powers, and continually readjusts the thresholds to ensure that a drift in power still remains readable.  ', 'How to use the BladeRFHow to integrate assembler instructions into a C programHow to calculate the power of a I/Q RF signalHow to roll-your-own clock resynchronisation ', 'At another hackathon we would love to increase the power of the system and improve its range. We believe we should be able to achieve substantially greater ranges by incorporating more RF knowledge into the project - using tools such as increasing the gain in hardware.We would also like to hijack the mobile baseband in your phone to pick up these signals automatically - without the need for a Software Defined Radio (SDR) like the BladeRF.

"wake","The alarm that actually gets you up","[3157, ""If you've ever hit the snooze button again and again and again only to realize hours later that you should have been up long ago, then you've felt the pain that we have felt. Driven by the need for an alarm that genuinely got us up, we set out to create wake. The app itself is simple. Instead of tapping or sliding a button to disable it, the user must get out of bed and walk a certain distance away to disable the alarm or vigorously shake the alarm for twenty-seconds. These physical triggers engage the user in a way that alarms have not done in the past. Leveraging the GPS and Accelerometer features of modern smartphones we created wake. Additionally, typical snooze features enable users to form bad habits by continuously snoozing an alarm. Instead, wake provides a unique form of negative reinforcement. Users can choose to enable or disable the snooze feature, but there's a catch. The snooze feature must be linked to the user's bank account, and every snooze donates a pre-set amount of money to an entity of the user's choice, such as a charity or political campaign.How we built itThe application was built in Objective-C for iOS devices. We leveraged iOS’s NotificationCenter, AudioToolbox, AVFoundation, CoreLocation, and CoreMotion frameworks to implement all the features for this application.

Additionally, the UILocalNotifications that we used for the event triggers were uncooperative and sometimes would not fire — so we also built a standard timer to alleviate this issue.Unfortunately, due to the lack of an Objective-C wrapper/library for Plaid, we were unable to complete integrating their payment processing system.Accomplishments that we're proud ofWe were proud of the UI animations, flow, and functionality of the app. We wanted to make the app not only be functional but also to look/feel great.

"MemoryEye","Help those with Alzheimer's remember their loved ones.","[4661, ""The future of tech is accessible, so we wanted to leverage the resources offered by Hack MIT to make our first step towards that direction. Since the hackathon's theme is hack for a reason, we decided to hack for a cause that affected both our team members and many others: the Alzheimer's disease. And with the Alzheimer's awareness month right around the corner (November), we thought that Hack MIT 2019 was the perfect opportunity to build something cool and start a discussion around this disease. "", ""MemoryEye enables the user to easily create a memory by taking pictures of an object or a person that they want to remember, and adding a description of the memory. When the user comes across this person or object again and can't remember exactly who or what they are, they can take a picture of the person or object, and the app will use computer vision to pull up the memory that they recorded earlier so that they can relive that memory and remember again. "", ""Once we had a general idea of the solution to the problem we were trying to solve, we split-up our team into front-end and back-end sub-teams. We then established a list of required goals, as well as a list of reach goals that we worked on for the rest of the weekend. The result was a native IOS app made with Swift on XCode, utilizing Microsoft Azure's Custom Vision API for computer vision functionalities. "", 'We wanted to challenge ourselves by using a new tech stack for HackMIT 2019. For most of us, it was our first time developing a native app for IOS. Therefore, gaining sufficient context on the IOS programming practices was an important challenge for all of us.One specific challenge that we overcame was deciding how we would provide the Custom Vision model with enough pictures for it to be trained properly, without requiring the user to provide an absurd amount of pictures of their memory. Our solution was to require four pictures from the user, then manipulate the images to create new pictures out of them. This not only solves our problem of needing more data, but also increases our data variety to cover different angles, thus creating more robust classifiers.

"Agro Companion","App that allows USA Farmers to visualized their idea crops and also allows information exchange via a social network","[11681, 'As an IT Scientist, I have little knowledge on Agriculture based on Agric Science I did in Secondary School but thisknowledge wasn\'t enough so I started interviewing Farmers,Agricultural Lecturers and Students within my area and In my school on what to do to ensure excellent farming, maximum crop yield and to ensure thatall this information are passed from one generation of Farmer to another without alteration. The average resopnse I got were stated below.1.) If appropriate planning are in place regarding financial Capabilities,production cost,crops yields things will be okay.2.) Testing of soil propertises need to be done to know the crop suitable for a particular Areas.3.) The major problems faced by farmers are mostly drought, weeds and Insect Attacks. If this can be mitigated, then maximum yield can be expected.4.) Most Young Agricultural graduates and Farmers lack interest in Farming because of unavailability of Informations onModern trends in Agriculture. All Professors and all Agricultural Students and graduates in various Universities Points out that If USDA Dataset can be collabrated with Social Network for purpose of Dataset Analysis, Data Visualisation,information Exchange(Just like in Facebook),it will make farming/Agricultural Studies one of the most interesting disciplinein the world. For Instance a Young Graduate trying to setup a Soyabeans Farming can immediately leverage USDA Datasets andcan share his knowledge, ideas or issues with other Users(Farmers) via a social network thus ensuring information propagationthrough an unbroken succession from one generation of Farmer to another. Farmers are ensured that any issues on farming can easily be resolved by leveraging USDA Dataset and by other responses from Farmers from various Farming disciplines within the Social Network.What Inspiration & Interview Lands me into.USDA Dataset is Very Broad though the API Call for each dataset is very simple. Thanks for the USDA Enginneers.From Inspiration above, we all knew that Water(H2O) and Air(O2) are two essential commodities that support human lives.While Human uses Oxygen(O2), plant uses Carbondioxide(CO2) for Photosythesis as can  be expressed mathematically inthe Photosynthetic Equation BelowFrom the Photosynthetic Equation Above, You can Visualize the quantity of Water and Carbon(iv)Oxide needed as a reactant toyield a Product called Sugar.So from this equation, you can understand that water is very essential for plants growths andcrops yield. Consequently, lack of water commonly known as DROUGHT can be disasterous to plants as it can inhibitsphotosynthesis in plants and can lead to little or no crop yield or the plant may even die off due to lack of water.What I builtAn app that allows American Farmers to visualized their idea crops,predicts production cost, knows the favourable state for growing a particullar crop, visualized the amount of water needed(eg. Irrigated Water,Ground Water, Surface Water) and quantity of crops yields in Bushels over time.The app also allows information exchange between Farmers via a social network. The App leverages Irrigation Technology & Water Use (ARMS DATASET 1999-2006).What this App DoesComponents A: USDA Data VisualisationsThe App leverages Irrigation Technology & Water Use (ARMS DATASET 1999-2006). From the USDA Dataset above, we picked uptwo crops (Soyabeans and Corn) so we started with Soyabeans as a case study via the API Call.so the app were able to integrate all Planted Acres, Irrigated Acres, the ground water usage, surface water usage and irrigated water used on the crop(Soyabeans) and amount of products yields(Bushels) per application over time(eg 2006,2002,2000,1999 etc..). This datasets were collected for every statesin United States. All this datasets were dynamically created via API Call to deploy Data Visualization components and statistical graphs were ploted using Bar Charts, Column Charts,Aggregated Area Chart and Pie Chart distribution Analysis over time.With this Graphs Visualization Components, Farmers can be able to Visualized graphs Dataset on each states in USA on crops Yields(eg.Soyabeans) over time(eg year 2006,2002,2000,1999 etc)For instance in Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska etc........Farmer can graphically visualize over time,A.) Amount of surface water used vs Crop Yield(Eg. Soyabeans in Bushel)B.) Amount of Ground Water Used vs Crop Yield(Eg. Soyabeans in Bushel)C.) Amount of Irrigated Water Applied  vs Crop Yield(Eg. Soyabeans in Bushel)D.) Amount of planted Acres etc...From this graph Visualisation statistical Analysis, Farmer can be able to know the quantity of water(Eg.Ground,Surface,Irrigated)needed and amount of crops that can be produce with it with respect to time(Eg. year 2006,2002,2000,1999).For instance in Nebraska state in the year 2006, the average Arms Datasets were as followsGround Water Used: 90.472 Percent of Irrigated Acres.Surface Water Used: 9.528 Percent of Irrigated Acres.Water Used Per Irrigated Acres: 9.715 Per Inches.Irrigated Acres: 2369.147 Per 1,000 Acres.Planted Acres: 5050.109 Per 1,000 Acres.Crop Yield Per Irrgated Acres: 61.98 Pounds(cotton), Bushels(all other crops).All this statistical Data will help Farmers in decision making process like checking production cost, crops yield and Business Profitability The app also provides Dataset Graphs Visualisation Components that allows Farmers to Compare and visualize data at State Levelonthe amount of planted Acres per state, the amount of Water needed(Eg Irrigated, Surface and Ground Water) versus Crop Yield etc per state.This will help USA Farmers to know the States that consumes more water and amount of crop yields(eg. Soyabeans).For instance, graphs data visualisation on state level comparison eg in year 2006, shows that INDIANA consumes highest Groundwater(about 100.00 percent of irrigated acres and crop yields was 40.561 Bushels) whileNEBRASKA consumes lesser Groundwater(90.472 percent of irrigated acres and yield the highest crop in the year about61.98 Bushels)Based on Production Cost,You can see that Nebraska in the year 2006(ARMS DataSets) consumes lesser water and produces thehighest Crop Yields(Eg. Soyabeans) than its counter part state Indiana that consumes the highest water in the same year but produces a lesser Crop Yields.The Inference from this Arms dataset 2006 makes Nebraska one of the best state in USA suitable for Soyabeans Farming both in production cost and crop Yields.Components B: Social Network Integration with 1-to-1 Chat System with Photo Sharing OptionMy Interview with Farmers, Professors and all Agriculttural Students and graduates in various UniversitiesPoints out that If USDA Dataset can be collabrated with Social Network for purpose of Dataset Analysis, Data Visualisation,information Exchange(Just like in Facebook),it will make farming/Agricultural Studies one of the most interesting disciplinein the world. For Instance a Young Graduate trying to setup a Soyabeans Farming can immediately leverage USDA Datasets andcan share his knowledge, ideas or issues with other Users(Farmers) via a social network thus ensuring information propagationthrough an unbroken succession from one generation of Farmer to another. This Social Integration are design to function just like facebook.it will help farmers exchange informations between themselves. Farmers, Agriculturist can be able to Share and post status updates, post photos, post and Share Videos, send like & comments etc. about Agricultural modern trends and for educative puposes. Farmers can be able to send friend request to their fellow Farmers, Makes friends and chat with one another on 1-to-1 chat conversationswith photo sharing options. Users can be able to search Farmers based on their names,email address, phone number and Farmersfarming specialization. For instance if you are looking for a farmer that speacialized on Corn Farming to have a conversationwith him or her, you can just type corn in the search box and all farmers that specialized on corn farming will bepopulated.....If you know how to use facebook, this social integration will be easy for you as everything were implemented using facebookliketechnology and user friendly UI designs.How it WorksJust call up the application and make one time registration. Login to start accessing the app.To visualize USDA Datasets, click on AGRO PRODUCT, select soyabeans as a case study and then navigate. On the landingpage, you can be able to access the USDA Datasets on different states overtime eg(year 2006,2002,2000,1999), If the states you are looking for is  not loaded,Click on LOAD MORE US STATE button to load more state.Every Populated states immediately shows average Planted Acres, ground water used,surface water used, irrigated water appliedand amount of crop yield over time.To be able to visualize datasets statistics of a particular state eg ARKANSAS,NEBRASKA etc... you can click onClick on View State StatisticsTo be able to compare datasets statistics for all states at state level, click on Compare All States flanking each state.Once you are there first select the year eg (2006,2002,2000,1999) that you want to compare and visualized, and the graphsdata will be loaded for each year choosen. For further details reference the demonstration video or email me.For Social integration, everybody is already facebook fans, so just assume yourself to be accessing facebooks where you canpost Status Updates, Post Photos, Post and Share Videos on Farming and Agro-Educations. Can Send Friend request, Makes friends,Like and Comments on every post being Shared, can search and connect to any Farmer in United States. Among all can be ableto Chat with other Farmers in United States on 1-to-1 chat messages with photo sharing option..Challenges I facedSome Datasets has null values when making API Call to USDA ARMS DATASETs. NUll simply means that the value in Undetermined,unknown or Not available. I implore a module on my server backend that converts all null values in the API to zero to make statistical analysis more efficient.Again Building a Social Network with Facebook design with all techonogical components and features to make the app userfriendly and integrating it with USDA DATASETS for Data Analysis and Visualization took much of my time to be precise(32 days)What NextWe will adding other remaining crops and its datasets one after the other via the API call and allows data Visualisation on the fly while ensuringthat all datasets are in place.we need to expand social aspect of the Apps to allow farmers to start creating Farmers Groups, Farmers Page just likein facebook. Eg A farmer can create a group on titled ""Rice Farming"" and other farmers who are interested on Rice farming canfollow up.Comming SoonAndroid Version in less than 14 days. IOS and Windows version can be coded in less than 30 days if there is a need for it. All resources is just set for coding.Technology Upgrade coming soon......1.)

"PedSafety","Every pedestrian's companion","[4333, 'Every year hundreds of pedestrians and cyclists become victims of road accidents. We truly believe that technology can reduce this number very easily and PedSafety aims to do that. PedSafety helps pedestrians in numerous ways and ensures that they obey the traffic rules. It is the perfect companion app for pedestrians.We obtained the inspiration of the idea from two sources:Existing Look Up applicationThe ordered movement of animal groups in nature ', 'To use all the features of this application, Bluetooth beacons need to be installed on the traffic lights. The bluetooth beacons are very economical and can be easily installed on the traffic lights.  When a person with the PedSafety app reaches a traffic intersection, the application can detect the bluetooth beacon. If the person is crossing the road, the application would disable the phone functionality and display a ""Look Up"" overlay on the screen. It helps users to keep their eyes on the road and not on phone while crossing. Once the user reaches the other side of the road, the application detects the other beacon and provides reward points to users for using the zebra crossing.This encourages people to use the zebra crossing and not cross the road on any other points. This application is very useful for the Government authorities as well. The app can be used to send anonymous pedestrian and cyclists traffic information to the authorities. The bluetooth beacons can detect the intersections with high pedestrian density and routes with high cyclist density. These statistics can help authorities take informed decisions and build subways/overbridges and cycle lanes wherever required.The application also includes a floating camera which helps the pedestrians to see the sidewalk in the phones itself while using the phone. This nifty feature ensures pedestrians don\'t collide and avoid pits.  ', 'We started by observing and listing down the problems faced by pedestrians and cyclists. Lack of pedestrian and cycle lanes is one of the biggest issues. We started to build this application with the aim of solving this problem and the problem of pedestrian road accidents.We looked at various existing solutions and found that a very simple solution already exists. It was called Look Up. In our application we added that functionality and various other features.To gather pedestrian and cyclists data, we thought of using bluetooth beacon for higher accuracy. The authorities can also easily program the beacons to send awareness messages to all the pedestrians and cyclists. ', 'We had to come up with a low-cost solution which can effectively solve the problems of the pedestrians and cyclists. We all know that in ordered animal movements, every agent tries to optimise the movement of the team. The existing traffic solutions try to imitate this for humans by ordering their movement. The challenge we had was to gamify the existing system in a way which can ensure that pedestrian and cyclists obey the traffic rules.We believe that the current reward systems can easily be transformed into a redeemable award systems. This would give people more incentive to obey the traffic laws. ', ""We built one nifty feature which allows pedestrians to look ahead on the path while using their phones. We think that it is one nice thing which we built which we have already started using in our everyday lives. What's next for PedSafetyWe have thought of various features which can be integrated in this application in future.

"HN - frenly","Building a friendlier web community with sentiment analysis.","[3454, ""The web is just toxic because you and I can be toxic. The Problem of InternetEveryone hates that the internet can be really mean. Everyone hates the cyberbullies, the keyboard warriors, the irrational haters that contribute to this issue. Yet, everyone can easily become a bully, a hater, a keyboard warrior because people may get angry and act on anger without thinking twice. Hence, everyone is in this vicious cycle of internet toxicity. Creating it, spreading it and hating it all at the same time. As a conclusion, the internet needs to have a sort of measurement, that could not only think twice for us but also help us to think twice. We need a “frenly™” internet.Solutionfrenly™ is a Chrome extension that vows to end the vicious cycle of internet toxicity in the web, by proactively preventing toxicity from spreading and creating. Features as below:1. Read Post / CommentsWhen our backend sentiment analysis engine detects potentially toxic comments in the loaded web page, they will be censored by an overlaying color block. The user may choose to reveal the negative comment at his/her risk.If the page contains too many negative comments, we will request the user to consider to leave the page.By smartly detecting the web content, user can be in a more active position countering internet toxicity. Whatever is spread, can no longer harm. 2. Write Post / CommentsWe introduce a toxicity meter on the comment textbox. Before a comment is being posted, it is sent to our backend sentiment analysis engine to evaluate its polarity.If the polarity goes too negative, the system will pop a window to advise the user to reconsider his/her word choices.By initiating respectful reminding alerts, user can no longer fall easily for the emotional trap. Whatever is toxic, can no longer be created. 3. Post / Comment Wrap-UpA health check summary is provided to the user to assess his/her average negativity and subjectivity of input history.Implementation wise, we pull the active user's comments and posts using Facebook API and Twitter API and feed them into our sentiment analysis engine for evaluation.Tokenization is performed on the user's comments and posts to find out the top 5 most significant words used in each social media platform.By actively studying user’s internet speech, user can learn more about him/herself and cultivate the right mindset.Together with all 3 aspects, we hope to create a lightweight, yet powerful tool to help to build a nicer, friendlier web community.What's Next For frenly™frenly™ is now supported to run on Facebook, Twitter and Youtube. We hope that it could be extended on other social media platforms to continue its effort on combating cyber negativity.frenly™'s backend sentiment analysis engine could be improved to achieve more precise detection on negative and potentially harmful comments.TeamTan Hao HaoGary Lai Jun HongHeng Ming JiBuilt Withcsshtmljavascriptnatural-language-processingpythonsentiment-analysis-onlineTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    Hack&Roll 2019Winner                Top 8                  Created by  Heng Ming JiTan Hao HaoFinal Year Computer Science Student @ NTUGary Lai "", ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['javascript', 'css', 'html', 'python', 'natural-language-processing', 'sentiment-analysis-online']","True","49","['heng0178', 'gudgud96', 'onwardgary']","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/743/244/datas/small.png","False","0"

"Task Tracker","Everything we do is driven by time. Get more out of your time with Task Tracker","[10401, 'Many people suffer from the habit of procrastination which results in them falling behind and losing control of time. They aim to accomplish so much in such little time but fall short in doing so. This problem of procrastination is growing as serious rates, likely due to the introduction of new and improved distractions that are even harder to ignore. In fact, according to Dr. Steel, Phd, a physiologist at the University of Calgary, the population suffering from chronic procrastination increased from 5% to 26% between 1978 and 2007. Also, in a different meta-analysis experiment, Steel found that 80-95% of 2007 college students admitted to procrastination that negatively affected their classwork.  ', 'Task Tracker  is a solution to this problem that aims to attack it from all directions. The app helps users with achieving balance and becoming more productive by showing the user a comparison between how long they expected to spend on each task and how long they actually ended up spending. The app also puts every task into one of five categories, which are also compared for balance. Lastly, Task Tracker sorts the users tasks in the order the user must complete them to be most efficient based on information the user inputs about the task.The user can use this information to become more productive by decreasing the difference between the expected time and real time spent and can also become more balanced by trying to match the amount of total real and expected time put into each category. They will also become more efficient by completing the tasks in the order for most efficiency.  ', 'We built the app using MIT app inventor. This was minor challenge we faced during development of the app was learning the block language that we were unfamiliar to. To learn the language quickly, we spent some time looking through tutorials and creating the sample apps to learn the functions of the app inventor and the basics of how to code. Once we knew these, we began to program our app and used the guess and check method to overcome other programming hurdles.Most of out functions were programmed through complex decision structures that we created through the guess and check method and repetitive testing. An epitome was programming the sort function to work in all cases despite similarities in priority and expected time. We did this by adding multiple tasks with the same and different priority levels and programming the app to repeat the sort method between every 2 consecutive tasks until it is fully organized. The program uses one of our several algorithms, sort using an if...then case structure with variables programmed to change values for every run based on the given index.   ', 'Time constraint: One major challenge was completing the app and all necessary parts for submission prior to the deadline. We heard about the competition and applied late and had less time but solved this issue by splitting up the tasks and working together.MIT App Inventor language: A minor challenge we faced during development of the app was learning the block language that we were unfamiliar to. To learn the language quickly, we spent some time looking through tutorials and creating the sample apps to learn the functions of the app inventor and the basics of how to code. Once we knew these, we began to program our app and used the guess and check method to overcome other programming hurdles.Sorting: When developing the application, the sort function was a problem due to the complexity of the algorithm and the required knowledge of programming. To solve this problem we used the guess and check method. We developed several algorithms, and learned how they processed the information. we finally were able to make the current algorithm for sorting using a if...then case structure with variables programmed to change values for every run based on the given index.  Pie Charts: The last major programming challenge we faced was with the Pie Chart APIs. MIT app inventor does not have a function for charts and diagrams so I had to learn how to program and recreate APIs that I plugged into the show charts section of the Compare pages. These APIs take real time data from the app and convert them to show the information. I had a hard time formatting and setting up these charts but learned through online resources.Scalability: The scalability of the app was a minor setback in the design development process. The app was originally designed for mobile use since we were only able to test with the Samsung Galaxy S4. The text and buttons sizes and placement was based around this device. Towards the end of our process, we began testing using the Lenovo Yoga Tablet. Due to the large variance in size, the app was not able to format properly and we had to rescale everything using percents to match both tablet and mobile devices. ', 'We are proud of the many of our features that we were able to create despite the time constraint and our lack of knowledge of the language when we started the app. One major example are the Pie Chart Apis on the compare pages. For these we learned how to program, format, as well as embed live API charts into a web viewer of the app that could take changing real time variables within the app and use them to compose the charts. As side from the sort function, the update page functioning was also an accomplishment. Since there is no given timer, we programmed the stopwatch on our own and created many split functions to make the app able to add to the time already existent on the app. We also were able to program the app to allow people to stop the timer, take breaks, and then start the timer again and still allow for the time to compile under the actual time of the same task.  ', ""The development of Task Tracker demonstrates our ability to improve learn quickly and apply our knowledge. For the challenge, we had to learn a new language and create many complex functions using it in a small time period. As we developed this app, we experienced the entire software development life cycle. Which is we gathered requirements.  First we had a big picture of what we wanted to develop. Then we brainstormed among this group and with other students and documented what features would be useful in the app. Then we went through the list of features and determined which are feasible and could be developed in the timeline. After this we went into Design mode. Where we designed each page of the app and functionality of each page. How many buttons will be present and what each button would do. We also created sketch of each page to determine the look and feel of the App. Once we have finalized the design it is time to actually build the app. We started with building pages and adding blocks to each page for the intended functionality. Some of the functionality was straight forward and could be coded easily. Some of the functionality like sorting et., needed more research and learning before we could add the code. Once a page is developed and is supposed to be functional, then one of use (other than the person who developed the code) would test that page and document and defects (where the functionality didn't meet the design). Then the developer would go back and fix the code to work correctly. There were several iterations of coding and testing of both page display and code blocks before we could get to the page working exactly as deigned. At the end we tested the overall app end to end making sure that every single page is tested int he entire flow. Now we have an app working as designed.

"Purrpurino","The new way of embracing emotions","[7709, 'We wanted to create a tool that would help parents to educate their children, enhance empathy and reinforce positive values, while having a toy that would not bore kids.We wanted to create the first interactive toy for kids able to display emotions through colors, able to act autonomously or be controlled by parents via a mobile app, in order to help kids in their emotional and social development. We wanted everything to be built using the new wave of the internet of things, and create a toy that kids will see as something more than than a toy, a friend that they will spend the nights with! We had some goals in mind for the development of Purrpurino, which could benefit society in several ways: · It would help parents reinforce good behaviours in their children. Parents can set Purrpurino\'s emotions, and Purrpurino will act depending of that state. For example if the toy is sick it will expect a kid to take care of him, and if it is playful it will expect the kid to play with him. · It would help kids sleep at night, with dim lights that will keep company and help them stop being afraid of the dark! · A system to help parents waking up their kids, gradually increasing Purrpurino\'s led brightness in the morning and using the stepper motor to make the kid wake up with a smile.Purrpurino comes from a combination of different words - Purpurina (Spanish word for glitter), ""Purr"" (like the purring of cats) and the suffix -ino obviously comes from Arduino.  ', 'Purrpurino (purr-pur-ino) is a new plush toy that uses different sensors to interact with a kid, allowing them to learn from emotions and reinforce positive values. The way Purrpurino teaches about emotions is using different lights -  which correspond to different moods that are triggered depending of the actions of the kid. Purrpurino has 7 different states to display emotions: shy, awake, sleep, happy, sick, playful, angry/sad and has a lantern mode. A parent or guardian can modify the mood of Purrpurino through the app to project emotions in Purrpurino.  ', 'We used an Arduino 101 (Genuino 101 here in Europe) as the core brain of Purrpurino, and different sensors of the Grove Starter Kit. Using the Arduino 101 was crucial because it made it easy for us to create an app to communicate an Android app with the board, using the board integrated Bluetooth.The Grove Starter Kit Plus sensor set was a perfect fit as it had the main components that we needed to make Purrpurino come alive: · Light Sensor : To control if it is dark and make Purrpurino go to sleep.· 3 Axis Sensor : To know if Purrpurino is getting dizzy or if he is playing.· Piezo Vibration Sensor : To track if someone is petting Purrpurino. · Stepper Motor : To make the purr effect. And from ""standard"" components not from the grove sensor kit we used :· Push button : as a way to switch on / off lantern mode.· ws2812b 5050 RGB Leds :  to display the emotions and states of Purrpurino through led lights. Instructions of usePurrpurino starts in a shy state where he gets to know his new owner. His cheeks are blushed in this state and he needs to be petted to get used to the new owner. After some caresses, the light of Purrpurino will turn green while purring delightfully as a cat, as that indicates the happy state. Now the functions of Purrpurino can be showed.The new owner can play with Purrpurino, shaking Purrpurino gently to have a good time, but if he gets shaken too much, he will become dizzy. Some petting will fix his dizziness and he will be happy again.A parent or guardian can modify the mood status of Purrpurino through an app designed to do so. This way a parent can reinforce positive behaviours in their children or make them realise of a bad behaviour and teach them not to do so.If Purrpurino get angry, his owner can caress him to make the rage go away.Purrpurino can go to sleep when no light is detected, purring softly for a set of time that will allow the kid to sleep while feeling protected.Purrpurino has a button in his right paw to enable ""lantern mode"" so no matter if he is sleeping you can use it to brighten the room. ', 'We had never created before a connected app using bluetooth with a hardware device and it took some days before we could send data between devices. Plug-and-play hardware are not always easy to set up! We had some trouble with some parts of the hardware, that took us more time that expected to make it work properly. For example, the stepper motor was not working as what it was expected from the documented examples and it was a lot of trial and error to make the piezo vibration sensor to get the petting feeling that we wanted. We had some trouble when we had to fill everything inside the plush toy, as the components are rigid and we were fitting in a soft space, that continuously was being pressed, which led frequently to malfunctions and cable disconnection when we were testing the ""live"" prototype. ', 'We specially love the purr effect that you get when petting Purrpurino, as it reminds us of our cat. We are really proud of having created a working prototype of a toy that could be used to play, educate, and promote good behaviour on kids, but above all we are really proud of having created a toy that our test kids LOVED!  ', 'We have now a greater knowledge of Arduino and how to interact with different sensors, and we have learned how to communicate an Android app with an Arduino 101 board using Bluetooth! We have also learnt that recording videos with kids is really hard and we can barely use some minutes from the hours of footage that we have with them. ', '· Sound : Purrpurino right now is mute, adding sounds to empower emotions and states would be a really nice addon. · Real Time Clock : We want to keep track of time so we can implement new functions, like knowing when Purrpurino should wake up in the morning or start going to sleep autonomously. · In-app options - We want the parents or guardians to be able to set the wake up time or the time that Purrpurino should go to sleep.· Power management : This part needs to be tested carefully as it is really important to have the less possible consumption to make Purrpurino last longer with a simple charge. We want to set Purrpurino in deep sleep mode when he is in the sleep state.  · Rechargeable battery : We need a way to charge Purrpurino easily and if possible without having to open the toy. · More states and sensors : We will need to implement more ways to interact with Purrpurino, creating more states and adding more sensors to different parts of his body. · Data, metrics and graphs : We can get some sleep patterns and get the analytics of how a kid uses Purrpurino to check data like when is the toy most used, if the kid uses it at night among other things!

"Save A Life","Save a Life is an application that teaches you CPR in a modern way, and empowers you to help save someone’s life!","[6433, '70% of Cardiac Arrest happens outside of the hospital. The first few minutes are critical to organ function - it is imperative that the patient receives immediate assistance, which can mean the difference between life and death. We believe everyone in the world deserves access to the best CPR education available. Effective CPR can double the chances of survival and preserve vital brain function. ', ""We teach CPR in a modern, interactive way. We train people on how to administer CPR by providing conversation geared education on both a messenger and a web application platform. Our application teaches CPR for infants, children, and adults using varied learning tools such as speech, gifs, and language translation in order to be accessible to all as well as to keep users engaged, whatever their learning style may be. Within the app, users can leave comments, share the lessons they’ve learned, and use the social plugin to spread the message to Facebook's timeline. Our web apps can also show locations of Automated External Defibrillators within the U.S., and there's more to come. With modern Facebook Analytics, Google Analytics, and a user community, we can track the effectiveness of the interventions around the world, and perform analytics on our metrics from the many users our platform quantifying the impact we are having. With the user community, new ideas can be shared, and more lives can be saved.  "", 'We carried out research on different methods of conducting CPR and broke it down into 3 different groups: adults, children and infants. We found current applications that exist were very isolated, dry and outdated. We consulted an industry expert,   Trauma Nurse, and Police Officers. We received feedback from them about how vital an application like ours could be for them in the line of duty and how we could further improve Save A Life. We worked with talented developers to create a unique platform to connect individuals through healthcare - you will always remember the person who saved your life, or a family members life. We wanted to make it easily accessible in order to reach a wider audience, especially people in underserved communities and in developing countries. People in these regions may have limited access to electronics, and might only own a cellphone.

"DeFiZap","Allocate your assets across multiple DeFi protocols in one transaction. Save time. Save gas.","[9156, 'Since publishing educational guides about popular DeFi tools (DeFiTutorials.com) and observing early-users’ simulations on DeFi Strategies, we were inspired to create an easy way for anyone (no matter how much they know about using each DeFi tool) to get instant access to multiple DeFi protocols. Right now, DeFi is just a buzzword to most people. We even noticed someone taking advantage of the DeFi community\'s current traction. They set up ""DeFi"" tokens to make gains through the unawareness of other people who believe \'DeFi\' is an asset they can invest in through these tokens. People see ETH locked in DeFi going up and think, “How can I get exposure to that growth?!” We are putting education at the core of our approach to make sure this doesn\'t happen to anyone. ', ""Zap is a smart contract that auto-spreads incoming deposits across Compound, Fulcrum, TokenSets and others, in a single transaction and based on pre-set allocations - bypassing many manual steps. You can send ETH to a Zap contract of your choosing and receive allocated tokens. For example, Lender Zap allocates incoming deposits 90% to cDai and 10% to dLETH2x. Therefore, if you send 1 ETH to this Zap, you will receive 0.9 ETH's worth of cDai and place a 2X margin trade with 0.1 ETH on Fulcrum (giving you exposure to 0.2 ETH). Lender's Zap is interesting because, within a year, the interest generated from cDai could completely cover your margin trade purchase.Think of it as trading with your future interest earned. We have also created a 'Zap Generator' to help end-users filter available Zaps based on their investment goals and risk profile. Users answer a few multiple-choice questions to see which Zap might fit their needs. Some combinations are still being finalized so please do not take this as investment advice. During this hackathon, you can view almost all available Zaps generated, but only Lender Zap is live on the mainnet. *** UPDATE: We deployed ETH Maximalist Zap - open BTC short & ETH 2X margin trades on Fulcrum in a single transaction. Learn more here.Lender.DefiZap.eth and ETHMax.DeFiZap.eth are registered on The Ethereum Name Service so that transacting on Compound + Fulcrum is as easy as sending a deposit from your wallet.Ultimately, we intend to allow our users to be able to create their own Zaps, based on their custom requirements. In the meantime, you can submit a custom Zap request here. "", 'For the LenderZap (see here), we have 3 Smart Contracts that deploy the investment received from the user into cDai and dLETH2x.  The primary reason to write 3 different Smart Contracts is to keep all the Smart Contract code modularised, keeping security as the prime goal.  The first contract with which our front-end interacts (see here) accepts ETH does the necessary allocation of ETH and sends it to the two(2) Sub Smart Contracts that make the investments.  Both our Sub Smart Contracts (see here and here) have a function which then makes the investment.  The Key Points to be noted over here are:-The investment functions take the address of the investor from the Main Smart Contract as the Address to which the assets are to be bought and sold;-For ETH to WETH to DAI, we use the Kyber Network’s Proxy Contract using the swapEtherToToken function; and-For the investment in Fulcrum, we talk to the Fulcrum Interface and interact with the mintWithEther function.-Keeping Security in mind, our Main Smart Contract and the two Sub Smart Contracts have a fall back function which also makes the investment once an ETH is sent to their address.-Since both the Sub Smart Contracts do not do any allocation of ETH they are modular plug and play and can be used behind any smart contract which does a different allocation.Keeping Security in mind, our Main Smart Contract also has security toggles that can stop the function of making any investments. ', 'Work in Progress with Token Sets: The Major Challenge that we ran into was working on creating a ZAP on top of TokenSets.  Sadly that is still work in progress.  Sadly their entire smart contract infrastructure does not simply accept ETH to mint the necessary rebalancing Sets.  For this purpose, we had to create a Smart Contract that works with the Provable Oracle to call for the price of the Set every time investment had to be made.  However, even after solving that major hurdle, we learned that every investor who had to interact with the Sets Smart Contract had to have not just WETH (for which we were using Kyber Network) but also any other component asset that they have defined in their smart contract - adding to this, there was NO way to determine how much quantity of either of the component assets were required.  This threw a major ball into our direction.  We are now working with the Token Sets team to resolve this issue so that we can add that as a product offering really really soon.Lost USD50 worth ETH due to wrong interaction with the Compound Protocol: While doing our first round of testing on the mainnet, our Invest2cDAI function interacted with the Mint Function of the Compound Contract and accepted uint as a return.  This uint should be the cDAI tokens that are minted.  We then straight-away asked for the Compound Smart Contract to transfer the output uint received.  We realized, the hard way, that we were wrong.  The returned uints were not being picked by the transfer function thus locking our assets.  Thus, we had to re-do a new contract which would first check our updated balanceOf and then do a 100% transfer of cDAI.No sync on Test Nets:   We could not, unfortunately, Test our contracts on Test Nets due to main reason that the DAI and WETH tokens that the Kyber Network, Compound Protocol or bzx Protocol recognized were different (their own custom addresses).  Due to which the interaction between multiple protocols on the Test Net was a challenge.A Global Team: Our team is spread across 5 cities from 4 different countries with 4 different time zones. Singapore, Mumbai, Pune, Peru, & New York. We all come from various individual backgrounds, but ended up working as a team for this hackathon. We range from Accountants, to Entrepreneurs, to Developers, to recent Computer Science graduates. Despite all of our variations, we acclimated to seamlessly communicate and actualize the product from the ground up effectively. ', ""-Accessing DeFi protocols through Zaps, costs less gas than individually transacting on each one to attain the same result. For example, going from ETH to cDai on Compound and ETH to dLETH2x on Fulcrum will end up costing you ~$5-$6 in transaction fees. Lender's Zap helps you acheive ETH to cDai + LONG2xBZX in a single transaction, for ~$0.86-$1.76. -Registering Lender Zap on ENS, now investing into Compound + Fulcrum is as easy as sending a deposit from your wallet to Lender.DefiZap.eth "", 'We learned a lot about different investment strategies that could be ‘remixed’ with available DeFi tools and how to calculate overall ROIs.

"Guardian","The number of firefighter injuries has increased by over 28% in the past 30 years. Our team sought to tackle this issue by creating a novel helmet utilizing IOT to improve firefighter safety.","[7574, 'We believe that the impact of ideas is the foundation on which we should build our world on. Our team was inspired to take on a challenge that would improve the lives of those around us while remaining true to our roots. When the Fort McMurray fires of 2016 destroyed over 3244 homes and caused 9.9 billion USD in damages, the lives of our team members were transformed. Coming from Alberta, the effects of the fire left a lasting impression on our views of how technology can be used for good and helped us discover a newfound sense of purpose. We sought to use new and novel technologies to make this a reality. Guardian is a novel helmet designed to advance current firefighting methods. By attaching various crucial sensors on the helmet, we are able to gather important vitals about the environment such as temperature, CO2 levels, atmospheric pressure, volume of total organic compounds, and much more while simultaneously sending this data in real-time over the Internet of Things platform to a remote database. We then retrieved this information and created a unique web user interface that responded to the real-time changes in data to relay information across all individuals over watching the situation.  ', 'The Guardian firefighter helmet sends and retrieves information by using six sensors connected to a central microcontroller capable of connecting to nearby WiFi networks. When information from the environment is extracted, we are capable of sending this information using WiFi following the IOT protocol to a remote real-time database where it is stored and processed. When this information is retrieved, it is used to create a web user interface that displays the information in a real-time framework to show changes as they happen. This interface allows all subscribers to the web app to monitor the situation different firefighters are and providing assistance when needed. ', 'The microcontroller we used for this project is the NodeMCU board which is an Internet of Things enabled board built on top of the Arduino framework. We then attached several sensors to the board (DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor, CCS811 Air Quality Sensor, BME280 Atmospheric and Pressure Sensor, and VEML6070 UV Index Sensor) following the I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol where we used a multi-master/multi-slave architecture to allow sensors to publish and receive data to the bus system. When the data is received by the NodeMCU microcontroller, the data is sent over WiFi to a real-time Google Firebase database where it is categorized by sensor and type of data. This information is then retrieved and displayed on a web app user interface updated in real-time. The web app is built using the Vue.js framework to process the real-time data. Other areas of the web app such as the front-end design are built using the HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. Additional features were implemented using Bootstrap, and ApexGraphs.  ', 'Throughout the project, our team ran into several challenges regarding the hardware aspect of the implementation of the helmet. As this was our first time using the IOT framework, we found it difficult in the beginning to find a method of connecting to WiFi. When we initially tried to use an Arduino Uno board and connected an ESP8266 WiFi module to it, we found that the setup required to connect to Google Firebase required several external frameworks that we were unable to implement. As a result, we switched over to the NodeMCU board which had the ESP8266 WiFi chip already built into the board. However, since this is a much smaller microcontroller, the number of input and output data pins was half of that of the Arduino Uno. In order to counteract this, our team members learned to use the I2C protocol which allowed us to connect several sensors to only one bus and save the input and output pins.  ', ""As a team, we overcame multiple challenges in order to produce a fully functional product. We were able to integrate both hardware and software into this project. On the hardware side, we implemented a total of six sensors: temperature, carbon dioxide concentration, total volatile organic compounds. We are very proud of connecting most sensors through the I2C protocol, making the product lighter and more portable. On the software side, we implemented real-time database using Google's FIrebase. By uploading real-time data collected from the sensors to the database and retrieving them to the web application, operators behind the screens will have an accurate picture of the fire scene. They will be able to make appropriate decisions to better exterminate the fire and possibly safe the lives of the firefighters. "", 'This project taught us the importance of communication protocols. Since we had team members working on the software side as well as team members working on the hardware side. It was crucial for us to establish a communication protocol early on in the project as it is difficult for both teams to work on the project simultaneously if the software team was not retrieving data from the hardware team. In order to overcome this, we made sure to establish a solid form of communication of data so the software team knew exactly how to fetch the data and what format it would be in. By doing this, as the hardware team was integrating more sensors, the software team was able to generate their own faux data following the same communication protocol before real data was provided. This made integrating the two sides of the project at the end very easy and efficient.  ', 'In the future, we plan on implementing a full master-slave protocol between the web app and the microcontroller. Currently, the microcontroller is capable of sending information to Google Firebase and the web app is capable or retrieving it, however, the opposite is not possible. Having the web app alert firefighters of unstable or dangerous conditions is crucial in the safety for all parties involved, as a result, in the future we will want to implement the ability for the web app to publish to Google Firebase as well and allow the microcontroller to retrieve this data and provide feedback to the user. For example, if one helmet detects a dramatic increase in CO2 gas, a notification will be able to the sent to all helmets after the data has been parsed and sent to the web app.  ']","['iot', 'arduino', 'vue.js', 'javascript', 'html5', 'css3', 'c', 'c++', 'firebase', 'google-cloud', 'i2c', 'hardware', 'bootstrap', 'apex-charts']","True","47","['maxonezhou', 'tpinto7', 'ericfeng', 'darrylwu']","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/840/765/datas/small.png","False","0"

"Project Dumpster 1.01","Picking up litter...gamified. Integration of game mechanics to encourage large scale trash collection.","[4326, 'The Roomba and Pokemon Go. We wanted to combine the idea of an autonomous robot that collects trash (humans are better for this) and the fun of an augmented reality game to utilize gamification strategies in a socially beneficial manner. ', ""There are 2 main components to this project. Service Bots, the autonomous, trash seeking robots, and the mobile application. Service bots roam around looking for objects that have similar physical attributes to trash (objects that are typically low to the ground). Once a service bot detects an object, it drops a pin to the google maps activity in the application at the coordinates specified on the communicator android phone which is on the bot. It is up to the user to look for this trash to redeem points, the user must take a picture of the object while in the app which then sends the image to the Google Cloud Vision API, which returns probabilities of the object in the image being some other image. The application is looking for high similarity hits of certain objects that we have predefined to be trash (water bottle, glass bottle, etc). If the user's image has high likelihood of being trash, the user will be credited. "", 'I, Sean Connolly, a Computer Science major from Northeastern University, and my friend from high school, Conor Boston, an Aerospace Engineering major from Pennsylvania State University teamed up to take on this project. This is our first time working with an Arduino (definitely not our last), there was a hefty learning curve for both of us.Conor handled the electronics and hardware components of the project: Arduino 101, Uno, Motorshield, Ultrasonic Sensor, Solar Panel and external power supplies. Conor has had experience working with robots in the past, this is why I recruited him to the Project.I worked on building the software for the Android application and both of the Arduinos. I had built android apps before this project, but mostly simple tic tac toe games or soundboard apps. So an augmented reality game was significantly more challenging, and rewarding. Also the allure of learning a thing or two about hardware was very appealing. ', 'As mentioned before, the learning curve was the challenge. Coming from no experience with Arduinos or micro-controllers, it was very intimidating at first to begin, however, online resources and ease of use of the Arduinos on board capabilities such as the accelerator, made this manageable for us.

"Butler for Trello","Automate Trello in plain English.","[4188, ""I used Trello to track my development projects. At some point, I realized I was doing a lot of repetitive actions, and decided to look into solving it.I created a simple bot that would allow you to do a few Trello things automatically, and made an announcement in the Trello subreddit. It had a very positive reception, which made me think there was a need to be covered.But the bot wasn't integrated in Trello and it was hard to use. So I decided early on that I would write a Power-Up, but it took me a long time to figure out how to fit automation into the Trello UI. Eventually, it clicked: the Power-Up experience is all about integrating fully with the UI, and one of the most powerful capabilities that Power-Ups allow is the integration of custom buttons in the UI.So, using the experience learned on the bot, I built the Power-Up relatively quickly, and we finally launched it in June 12th this year with very good feedback. "", 'The Butler Power-Up lets you add contextual buttons to Trello that, when clicked, perform automated series of actions. For example, a button show in a card can move it to the ""To Do"" list, add me as a member and post a comment.I also added actions that are not available in Trello. For example, you can copy or move one or more cards randomly selected from a list, or sort a list by due date, title, time in list, labels or a custom field.Importantly, you don\'t even need to create the buttons. The Power-Up is able to gather statistics of your Trello usage and recommends buttons specifically for you and for each particular board.Buttons can be shared with other team members so teams can apply consistent processes and everyone can improve their productivity with minimal effort. ', ""The server runs on node.js on AWS Lambda. I don't tend to use many frameworks or libraries so most of it is hand-written JavaScript. I make full use of the facilities provided by the Power-Up API, such as  data storage at the board and team level. I store other data on DynamoDB. "", 'Trello is surprisingly flexible, and from the early start it was obvious that every person uses in their own way and wants to automate different things. So a big problem was how to provide all these options without creating a monstrous and hard-to-use user interface. I solved this by using a natural-language user interface, in which the user basically writes English sentences describing what she wants to do. ', ""I'm proud of the level of integration accomplished. The button experience feels natural and being contextual is pretty darn useful. It's a testament to how well the Trello Power-Up API is built that I was able to integrate this deep.I'm also proud of the flexibility and power that the product offers. It's relatively easy to create single-function power-ups, but it's extremely hard to make something that allows so many combinations with a reasonably simple user interface.  I don't think there's anything like this in any other project management platform. "", 'As mentioned before, Trello hides surprising power and flexibility in an apparently simple package. I learned a lot from seeing all the different ways people use Trello for different applications, from managing household chores to organizing small assembly lines. Our users include lawyers, estate agents, car repair shops, virtual assistants, software project managers, ... you name it! ', ""We will continue to expand what it does, in particular the range of actions that it can perform.There's also going to be major new features that will make it even more useful. Without giving away too much, we plan to add the ability to show or hide buttons depending on certain conditions, such as which list the current card is in. Also, the ability to automatically add due dates to cards based to text typed in them, and have commands that are triggered by due dates.

"EthOptions","A decentralized ERC20 Options Trading platform to hedge against your crypto investments by leveraging profits and managing risks.","[5627, 'The cryptocurrency market saw a dramatic fallout throughout 2018. With Bitcoin falling from a value of $17,000 per coin in January of 2018 to around $3,500, many traders incurred losses since the start of the year.Whether you are a trader or an investor, your objective is to make money. Your secondary objective is to do so with the minimum acceptable level of risk.Now Derivatives are financial instruments that aim to increase returns and reduce risk. A Derivative is a financial instrument that derives its value from an underlying asset, in this case, cryptocurrencies. An Option is a contract that gives an investor the right — but not the obligation — to buy/sell an asset at a certain price within a certain period of time.The idea behind ETHOptions is to introduce options contracts over the blockchain, for traders to hedge against their crypto investments beyond Bitcoin. Bitcoin Options do exist, however as the market share of ERC20 tokens have grown to 91% due to the daily trading volumes and number of projects existing on the Ethereum Blockchain, Options contract for ERC20 tokens will have a huge market outreach.All the major crypto players are getting into Bitcoin derivatives. Whereas, derivatives for Ethereum based tokens is still an untouched market.We’re providing a new Crypto Asset class that can potentially have a market size of $42 Billion. ', ""We have created a decentralized ERC20 Options Trading platform. On our platform, the option Maker can create an order, filling out the details which are added as an order to our Orderbook making it available for everyone to access. Along with the details, he must also give the allowance to transfer the BaseTokens to the escrow to be released when the option is exercised.The Taker can choose the most profitable option in the Orderbook according to his judgement and fill it. To do so, he would be prompted to pay the premium for that option in the QuoteToken. Using Kyber, traders can swap the required ERC20 at the time of payment and pay with whichever ERC20 tokens they have. They receive the ERC721 OptionTokens for the corresponding option order filled.Before the expiry time, the Taker can choose to exercise his Option by giving his OptionTokens to purchase the locked BaseTokens at the Strike Price, in terms of QuoteTokens. This will be possible after verification by the smart contract wrt to expiry time and Market Price of the BaseToken according to a Chainlink Oracle which takes the price through a Coinmarketcap API. Using Chainlink, we were able to ensure the integrity of data sensitive to the trading. Taker can then sell BaseTokens in the market, thereby making a profit of (MarketPrice - StrikePrice) per locked BaseToken.Challenges we ran intoOne of the major challenges while conceptualising the platform was that it would be difficult to make the platform popular as people would need the corresponding ERC20 token for the option they choose, restricting scalability. While exploring Kyber, we realised this problem will be solved successfully by integrating Kyber with our platform and allowing users to pay through it.One of the implementation challenges was writing the contracts such that no bad user input can get through, i.e., learning basic auditing to create a secure implementation. Also, another challenge was testing on public networks since we needed data from public networks like Kyber and Chainlink.Accomplishments that we're proud ofWe’re proud that we have managed to create a seamless user interface on top of the complicated smart contracts to successfully implement our vision. We believe our platform can help propel the mass adoption of ERC20 tokens and hence of blockchain by encouraging investment in more tokens. We are thus proud of having positively impacted the DeFi and Web3.0 space. What we learnedMaking this project has been a truly amazing learning experience, from learning about the decentralised finance space and how options work to learning about decentralised oracles and swapping protocols. Moreover, we learnt how to successfully write multiple inter-dependent smart contracts in sync with each other. We also learnt to properly use the Truffle Suite, to deploy contracts and write tests, and hence create a robust DApp.What's next for EthOptionsFor the future of EthOptions, we intend to extend the functionality by also introducing Put Options. We want to make the OptionTokens tradable so that one can sell their position. Also, we intend to extend the asset class our platform caters to, beyond ERC20 tokens by using the Synthetix platform. Besides the longing and shorting of Call and Put options, we intend on integrating popular Option strategies such as Covered/Married Call, Bull & Bear Call/Put Spreads, Iron Condor, etc. to benefit from all sorts of market movements. The platform will allow for a Plug-n-Play approach to easily form option strategies.For amateur traders, ETHOptions will show the possible strategies based on the market conditions that the trader can benefit from.

"", ""The idea behind the service is very simple. First, you define what a perfect weather means for you at a given moment in time. Currently, you can filter by temperature, wind speed, precipitation type and probability of precipitation. Then, the service does the rest and you are presented with the best matching destinations. The results are sorted by the amount of perfect days, those matching the original query, found in a week for each city and limited to top five. Perfect days are also marked with a different background. Currently, only 100 touristy cities in Europe are supported.Let's see how we could use the service for the use cases defined in the previous section.Set the wind to be between 16 and 32 km/h ideal for flying a kite, small chance of rain, comfortable temperature.Set the min temperature to be warm enough for you, set the chance of rain to 0%.Set the temperature to be around and below 0 C, choose snow as a precipitation type and the chance of precip. to be high.Set the wind speed to be less than 16km/h, little rain and clouds as you want to avoid it being too sunny and have the fish go deeper in the water, comfortable temperature.Choose whatever conditions you want to have for your multi-day cycling trip.If you wish, you can easily check out how to get to your chosen destination,as the application comes integrated with a travel search service SkyScanner.

"Modified Dijkstra algorithm for optimal navigation ","Modified algorithm to assign most optimal path for better navigation","[4305, 'The 21st century ushered with it the age of smart and predictive technology with the optimum use of resources to make life easier and take preventive measures against predicted mishaps. In accordance with this trend, the proposal is an automated (SAE level 5) mode of transport using a modified Dijkstra’s algorithm with concepts of Ant Colony Optimization, big data analytics and cloud computing for number crunching to arrive at the destination based on the traffic and the number of drivers on the road, in the shortest time possible instead of the usual shortest distance algorithms. The analysis of the time saved by the drivers for different map types is recorded and compared and the results are found to be more efficient with respect to time as compared to the time taken by the original Dijkstra’s algorithm. ', 'Start: the user is logged into the system as soon as the car is turned on. Choose the destination: The source and destination are chosen based on the current position as identified by the GPS system and the input by the user respectively. The path is set for the shortest travel time: Using the proposed modified algorithm, based on all the users currently logged onto the system and their current position and destination the route that takes the shortest time to travel is set.Automated transport: Using the grid based system where the inaccessible roads are blocked out by giving a very high value and the weight is taken in accordance with the speed the car can achieve on the particular road, the user is transported from source to destination. Arrive at destination: With minimal sensors, this automated mode transport uses big data analytics and cloud computing to ferry people from one place to another safely.Stop: Once the car is stopped, the user has logged off the system.The first part of the prototype consists of the modified Dijkstra’s algorithm in which the shortest path is determined based on the time taken and not on the distance between the source and destination. (how many people own cars) (statistically how many people would want to go to the same place at the same time in a particular place) If the shortest route is to take the I-16 and turn north towards the bridge, and all 100 people take the I-16 and turn north, then imagine the traffic jam a vehicle would be stuck in with the agonising honking and bumper to bumper trafficThe whole ground can be represented as a grid or a matrix. A path can then be plotted based on the parts of the grid that are free. For example, if there is a pothole then that part of the grid can be made as inaccessible and will not show as a viable route that can be taken. Similarly to all the places that are on either side of the road. ', 'We built it using C++. ', 'To identify the parameters that were required to be considered and to make sure that the time complexity of the algorithm is as less as possible. ', ""The trial runs performed for a number of matrices of varying sizes and the time saved by each of the drivers were taken as an output and for a small map size of 10x10, the combined time taken was reduced by close to 26%. As the map size increases, we can observe that the time saved for each driver is increased. This shows that with the increase in map size that the real world scenario will have, the time saved will increase thus proving the efficiency of the modified algorithm and ensuring high performing automated cars.What's next for Modified Dijkstra algorithm for optimal navigationThe future work would be to build a prototype of the model and go over the safety features in the case of a failure with a fine comb and to build a real-time web version of it.Built Withc++      Submitted to    MHacks NanoWinner                All Submissions                  Created by  Mashrin SrivastavaSaumya SuvarnaGarima Gupta "", ' ', 'The future work would be to build a prototype of the model and go over the safety features in the case of a failure with a fine comb and to build a real-time web version of it.

"If-Found-Lost","No need to write your contact information on the things that can be lost or misplaced again.","[4072, ""Here is how I got the idea. I once forgot my laptop charger at the library in University. It took me 3 days to find it at the end, because there is no way to contact me, for a person who finds it. I could have written my name, mobile number and contact information on it, but it is embarrassing because every sees it. So I thought how can I solve this problem and are there any existing one. I could find that there isn't any existing solution. So I focused on it. What I need is something everybody can easily see, but cannot contact me or bug me throw it. I think it may look like a encryption problem too. I alway enjoyed compiling innovating solutions to problems, so I got a solution and here we are. "", 'When a user create an account in If-Found-Lost.com he get a globally unique numeric id which is short to be easily rememberable and writable. So if the id is 7766 it makes a URL, www.If-Found-Lost.com/7766. So instead of private contact information this is what he writes or prints on his items. For example he can write it in his books, in the keytag of his backpack or in his quadcopter. The name If-Found-Lost is there to make the intuition that what should you do ""if you found this lost"". So lets say Ann found my charger so she just has to go to that link and need to enter the best way to contact her as it asks. She does not need any login or create an account, just to go trough a captcha. Then I will get the message right away to my inbox in If-Found-Lost, saying Ann has found this and this is the way to contact her. So I am the one who decides whether to contact her or not. So I am directly contacting Ann and getting it, and I did not expose my privacy details to the public.Here is another thing, I thought how to expand this as a business. For an unique id given by the website, we\'l say it as IFL(stands for If-Found-Lost id). So If my packpack or music player coming with an IFL built-in, I do not have to write my id on it. Just as we login to warantee information, after buying that item we go to If-Found-Lost.com and link that IFL with our account. This gives manufactures a competitve advantage, becuae lets say switss gear is joining with us and with every backPack it comes with a uniqueID printed and it makes their backPacks globally findable without exposing the privacy of the owner. ', 'I am using MeteorJS and mongoDB for databases. Using semantic-ui to give it a nice look and some fast rendering. Using google recaptcha for authentications where it does not need to sign in. Created the website to look and feel simple as possible which makes users happy. ', 'I had to build this on my own without teammates, because we are having an exam tomorrow and everybody is busy with that. So I worked straight 24 hours to implement this. Meteor makes is great and most importantly fun to develop. I was familiar with C++ and Java before, so this was a real fun to do. It took me time to make videos and stuff because I did all individually in a limited time. But the hackathon was one hell of a fun. ', 'If-Found-Lost is now a fully working product.

Next plan is to build a userbase for the website and to talk with backpack, purse, quadcopter, etc; manufactures to sell them the service of If-Found-Lost.com at a price per IFL.

Max capacity for cars to go through Hsueshan Tunnel is 2,400/hr and the average weekend car flow is 71,000 cars. There have been a wide range of discussions on how to tackle the issues from providing instant monitoring to leveraging the public transportation to reduce the total car flow. Are there any other options we can leverage to reduce some pains and time spent waiting on the road?

"Build Meister","Trigger &amp; get the status of your builds with your voice, without having to log into a computer!","[3788, 'We wanted to improve the performance and efficiencies for Development Teams. We were looking to increase development performance by loading build status requests and trigger new builds, using a self-service setup. This led us to build a new Alexa Skill; We call it Build Meister. ', 'The Alexa Skill queries build tools through a proxy node service and retrieves build status information. It then triggers new builds on an associated project. If the project and plan keys are provided, the Alexa Skill would be associated with a particular plan. If not, the Alexa Skill would query information across multiple build plans within a project and provides the results of the top 5 most recent builds. From there, the Alexa Skill requests that the user chooses an option number. The user can then select an option by saying the associated number. To end a search, the user would use the commands, ""Stop"" or ""Cancel"".Get Last Build Status This query retrieves the last build status from the project key provided in the CI Proxy service. If the build plan is not specified in the config file, then Alexa would provide the user with options to choose one of the build plans.Get Last Successful Build This query retrieves the last successful build from the project key provided within the CI Proxy service. If the build plan is not specified in the config file, then Alexa would provide the user with options to choose one of the build plans. Last failed Build Retrieves the last failed build in the plan.Trigger New Build Triggers a manual build in the plan.How We built itThis Alexa Skill queries a proxy node service that runs on the client server. The node service connects to their internal CI tool (such as Bamboo or Jenkins), and queries build status information and has the ability to trigger new builds. Since the node service runs internally, users do not have to provide CI tool credentials to the Alexa Skill. This is because the Alexa Skill and the proxy node service share authorized keys that allow requests from the Alexa Skill and blocks all other requests.Challenges We ran intoOne of the main challenges that we ran into, was that we decided to use the Serverless Framework to setup our Alexa Skill, as well as the API Gateway and Lambda connections. During the setup of the API Gateway, we chose to use Lambda as the integration point from API Gateway instead of lambda-proxy. This meant that we were required to setup some items manually within the API Gateway to allow the requests to work. This caused an issue when we tried to move the project from our AWS Dev account to our Production account. We had to duplicate the manual steps instead of being able to do it with Serveless\' CLI functionality.Proud AccomplishmentsPreviously, all of the Lambda functions were created manually by compressing and uploading through the Amazon portal.

"OrchestrAI","An improvisational AI that unleashes the creative power of an entire orchestra to music producers and artists","[8539, 'News outlets today are quick to publish how modern AI is literally superhuman in most fields, driving systemic change in the way our societies and economies are organized. Despite its far-reaching impact, AI has never felt less accessible. It seems like somewhere in the process of beating Go, captioning our images, and driving autonomous vehicles, AI has paradoxically lost its human touch. We want to bring that connection back in a way that fosters creativity and recognizes the strengths of both man and machine. We believe that something as powerful as AI should have a soul and, most importantly, expand human souls.  We want to empower music producers, artists and enthusiasts, giving them access to an entire orchestra of artificial agents to compose, create and improvise music. Rather than using AI to replace human talent, we see this as a means to augment and supercharge existing human facilities and intuition, allowing human composers to reach creative heights that were never possible before, both through real-time improvisational cues and procedurally generated sonic compositions.  ', 'We have built an AI orchestra, capable of improvising musical pieces in real time, inspiring and adapting to the humans it is playing with, and generating completely new songs based on its experience. We organized these three capabilities under two distinct pipelines within our platform. Ad Hoc improvisation and procedural generation is accomplished through our Neural Pipeline. The pipeline itself is driven by two different models. One consists of a character generating Recurrent Neural Network, capable of reading audio MIDI files and learning their structure. This network can then generate creative pieces on the piano, violin, cello, and trumpets. The songs we created sound both euphonic and aggressive, very different from what a normal human would compose. After seeing these results, we became very interested about what networks designed by actual music theorists can do. This caused us to also incorporate elements of Hexahedria’s Biaxial Recurrent Network within our pipeline. This model explicitly learns pieces by using music theory and multiple recurrence dimensions (temporal and note spaces) to generate beautiful music. Those results made us very excited, thinking about the different kinds of music that different AI architectures can create. Real-time adaptive playing is accomplished through the Improvisational Pipeline. This consists of an Arduino and two microphones (one from a set of Apple ear pods) mounted to a classical violin, which pick up the notes being played on our violin. We isolate these notes by sampling based on the beat. The note itself is determined by running a Fast Fourier Transform on the signal received and then extracting the most prominent frequency (a note is essentially a particular frequency). Finally, these extracted notes are mapped to new notes based on Music Theory, using concepts such as the pentatonic scale, perfect fourths, etc. ', 'This project made extensive use of the WolframAPI and Mathematica, mainly to convert signals from the violin to midi files. We also use Mathematica to output the processed notes as various instruments in our improvisational pipeline. Finally, our Neural Pipeline took advantage of the variety and abundance of built-in instruments within Mathematica to generate distinct sound profiles for our orchestral compositions with the RNN.The Neural module was built in tensor-flow, making extensive use of the RNN modules that were available then. The char-rnn architecture used to compose some of the songs takes into input textualized MIDI files and processes them through 2 hidden layers. After the training process, the network is able to generate textualized MIDI data, which then can be converted into actual music through the Wolfram API.  The biaxial RNN consisted of two vertical stacks of LSTM-RNN nodes who were interconnected, the note and time networks, each with two hidden layers. The input would consist of a vector consisting a vector’s MIDI note alongside some information on the note’s vicinity and the history of notes played. The input would then be passed through a vanilla recurrent time axis, in order to learn some structure. Then, the output of the time network would be passed to the note axis, who makes recurrent connections alongside other Note nodes. This ensures that the network is able to learn connections between different notes and their relationship to each other throughout multiple musical piecesThe Improvisational pipeline was powered by digital signal processing. The fundamental technique in digital signal processing is the Fast Fourier Transform, a O(n log n) algorithm that is incredibly versatile in its scope and application. In our project, it allowed us to filter different notes just through their frequencies. Since FFTs are just something that the three Computer Science majors in the group had studied in theory until that point, it was incredible to see its power when implementing it to build our application. ', 'Even in our demos, lag consistently hampered our efforts to sound euphonic. The best way we found to mitigate this was timing the delay so that it is always behind by a factor of the beats per minute of the violin composition. This is a fundamental limit in all sampling based approaches and requires a more sophisticated predictive model to completely eliminate.The neural networks also had issues. The most basic one was training time since the neural networks took 10 hours to train on all of our datasets. The most crucial challenge was out of our hands though. We had several problems in making the char-RNN learn musical structure, as it would often play awkward combination of notes, spend large amounts of time not playing anything and then compressing dozens of notes in a few seconds. More training epochs helped remediate this problem, but the architecture still needs better forms of representing musical structure in order to be more effective. ', 'Hardware – we literally hacked hardware to make it bend to our whims and needs for this project. Our hardware wizard (Azra) spent an incredible amount of time working with microphones and signals Artificial Intelligence – we had very little experience with non–traditional neural network architectures, especially exotic ones like the double weaved biaxial recurrent neural network used by Hexahedria. This project enabled us to understand how small architectural changes in neural nets can produce gigantic differences on a network’s output. ', 'Neural Nets take forever to train and it’s hard to predict their behavior after training. We also learned a lot from our mentors at Wolfram, especially regarding on how music can be made and represented by computers. ', 'We would love to use more advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques even in our improvisational pipeline, provided delay is not a limiting factor. We would love to integrate ensembles of neural network models and see how they would play together with each other, besides adding in better ML models to the pipeline. We also want to find more ways to connect this pipeline to the human element, by maybe providing more ways for the AI to help a human generate/create music.

"Limbr Reports for JIRA Cloud","Slice and dice your data with powerful custom reports, directly within JIRA - no spreadsheets required","[6777, 'Through my consulting practice, Limbr, I help software and marketing teams become more efficient and more effective through the application of lean and agile methods. I implement the Atlassian Cloud stack (JIRA Software, Tempo Timesheets, Confluence, BitBucket, HipChat) for each of my clients, customized with a set of battle-tested conventions and configurations that I\'ve honed over the last 5 years. While the setup works well overall, I have always found that the reporting capabilities left a little to be desired - far too frequently, a client asks me ""how do I find out... "", and my best answer has been ""run such and such JQL query, export the data to Excel, and manipulate the spreadsheet this way and that way"". This works, but presents a real hassle for users for simple ad-hoc reporting needs.For example, say I want to know the average velocity of one of my Scrum teams over the past eight sprints. I could either run the Velocity Report included in JIRA Software and break out my calculator to manually sum and average the shipped Story Points, or I could run a JQL query to filter for the relevant issues, export to CSV, and add aggregation functions to the spreadsheet. Furthermore, I want to calculate this figure before every sprint planning session in order to inform the team\'s commitment for the upcoming sprint. What a pain!I thought there must be a better way, and searched for viable solutions in the Marketplace. Unfortunately, while there were several reporting and business intelligence add-ons available for JIRA Cloud, they were all predicated on exporting JIRA data to an external BI tool. These tools are no doubt powerful, however needing to leave JIRA to perform basic segmentation or aggregation was exactly what I wanted to avoid. Additionally, I needed a solution that was both accessible and intuitive to grasp for a wide range of JIRA users, which was at odds with the requirement of buying and learning a sophisticated external tool.Thus, Limbr Reports for JIRA Cloud was born.  ', 'Limbr Reports essentially bolts a reporting engine directly into the JIRA user interface. Users can easily create a report, and then customize the presentation with a variety of configuration options. Each report sources issue data from a base query, constructed with JQL. The user decides how to slice and dice the data, sorting and grouping with unrestricted levels of nesting. Additionally, the user can configure aggregations (sum, average, minimum and maximum) on supported field types (numbers and dates, initially), and the report will calculate these aggregations at runtime and summarize the data at the report and group level. ', ""The add-on was built with the 3REE stack - React, Redux, RethinkDB and Express. The reporting engine runs completely on the client-side, and uses React for the views and Redux for managing application state. The client fetches report data directly from JIRA using Atlassian Connect's AP library.To ensure that the client complied with Atlassian Design Guidelines, I ported a good chunk of the Atlassian UI library to reusable React components. I hope to further polish this library and release it open-source it in the future for the benefit of other add-on developers.The client needs to talk to the add-on backend in order to persist report configuration metadata. To accomplish this, I built a series of JSON API endpoints, exposed by Express and backed by RethinkDB. I leveraged Atlassian Connect Express to help with JWT auth, installation lifecycle, and a few other functions. The API runs on Heroku and the RethinkDB instance is hosted with Compose.io.  "", 'Much of the technology stack I chose was new to me (I intentionally chose bleeding-edge), and the learning curve was pretty steep. This was my first exposure to server-side JavaScript, to functional style programming in general, and to Redux and RethinkDB. Attempting to learn and correctly apply sane architecture, idioms and best practices was demanding and often frustrating. I ran into numerous technical issues along the way, including the need to fork and modify both Atlassian Connect Express (improved compatibility with Express 4.x) and a storage adapter for RethinkDB (added authentication support).Technical challenges aside, the largest challenge I grappled with was deciding on the feature scope of my minimum viable product. I have a laundry list of features that I wanted to include in this first release, and found it painful but necessary to aggressively cut scope in order to make the hackathon deadline.  ', 'My ""day job"" is technical consulting, and although I\'ve worked on and with software teams over the past eight years and write a bit of code here and there, I don\'t consider myself a developer. This was my most significant (by far) attempt at writing an app for commercial use, and I\'m frankly extremely satisfied that I was able to complete it unassisted and create something of value. Regardless of the eventual popularity of the add-on in the Marketplace, at minimum I now have a viable solution to a problem that, until now, my clients have faced daily. I consider that to be an success by any measure. ', 'I learned way too much to list - some of the major ones include:Discovering that I actually enjoy working with JS, after ES6/ES7, Babel and Webpack perform their magicFirst time working with Express and server-side JS in generalFirst time working with RethinkDB and with a JSON document store in generalFirst time working with Redux and Flux architecture in generalFirst time applying functional-style techniques in earnest, influenced heavily by idiomatic Redux ', 'I have a significant roadmap for Limbr Reports, including:User- and group-level access control for reportsBetter support for Agile custom fields and a handful of remaining system fieldsSupport for other report data sources (e.g. worklogs, sprints, releases, projects, users)Configure advanced filters, over and above JQL filtering capabilitiesSegmentation by custom bucketsCalculated columns (e.g. display a column that sums the values from two other columns)Scheduled report delivery (e.g. email a report out on a weekly basis)Export reports to PDF, HTML, CSVData visualizations and chartsExpose reports as dashboard gadgets ... and much, much more!Thanks for reading!

"Tandem Medical","Tandem is a software startup that will revolutionize hospital communications, with an initial focus on the ER.","[4466, ""Tandem was built by a team of people obsessed with solving big problems in healthcare.  We were first inspired to tackle the problem of inefficient internal hospital communications last spring, when researching how existing communications systems lead to high patient length of stay, ambulance diversion, left-without-being-seen patients, and other key KPI's.  To get to the root of the problem, we partnered up with Dr. Alex Mohseni, the Chief Innovation Officer of Emergency Medicine Associates, spent over 100 hours over the summer observing, shadowing, and interviewing staff in every role in a hospital at Doctor's Community Hospital in Maryland.  At the end of the summer the Managing Director of that hospital joined our team as an advising partner and we designed a solution to the problem of inefficient internal hospital communications (starting with ER and ancillary departments) in partnership with our advisors and numerous clinicians. Shortly later DCH and our advising partner Puneet committed to pilot our solution. "", 'Tandem has two core features that make it completely unique in the healthcare communications space: Role-based communication: Providers rarely (if ever) know the names of the people they need to communicate with in other departments (i.e. Lab, Imaging).  Systems such as pagers, phones, and HIPAA-messaging products require users to find out the name/number of the person they need to contact, a process that requires them to either waste time looking for that person or sit on hold for 20 minutes.  Tandem integrates with EHRs and hospital scheduling systems to automatically distribute messages based off on role, saving providers around an hour per patient (a multi-million dollar proposition for even a small hospital).Task-based communication: Task-based communication is the structuring of messages in a queue-based ticketing system, which pulls in the relevant parties automatically and gives them the tools they need to quickly resolve tasks.  This system allows providers to focus on the messages that require their input, reducing communications overload and driving efficiency. ', 'Tandem is hosted on a HIPAA compliant cloud provider, Healthcare Blocks, and is built with PostgresSQL, Node.js/Express.js, and React.js. The initial design was developed with two doctors, who now act as advising partners. A prototype based off the initial design was completed in early January, and since then we’ve been collecting feedback from medical professionals, nurses, and doctors to iterate our product. Through Healthcare Blocks, we’re also using Mirth Connect to interface with EHR systems. We intend for our pilot version of the app to be fully HIPAA compliant and integrated with EHR, which should be completed by end of March.

Combination of social channel & engaging chat-bot empowers team members with ease of access to scrum management tool and thus task status update is no more a problem as it can be done on the move. This will assure current project health can be monitored and risks can be mitigated in timely fashion. Chat-bot* is a smart software, which along with AI can connect with end users via “human like conversation”.  ', 'We have leveraged power of following technologies for overall solution.   Amazon Lex: We have used Amazon Lex for building conversational chatbots with natural language understanding (NLU) to recognize the intent of text. Lex enabled us to build applications with highly engaging user experience and lifelike conversational interactions. Lex’s deep learning allowed us to quickly and easily build sophisticated, natural language, conversational bots (“chatbots”)  Amazon Lambda: We have used Amazon Lambda as the backend for validating user inputs to Lex during conversation and also for fulfilling user request to update task when all valid inputs are provided  Enterprise connectors like (Rally/Version One): These enterprise connectors are integrated with Lambda to fetch & update data from Scrum tool residing at enterprise backend. In this case, validation Lambda via enterprise connector would be fetching user stories & tasks details from Rally to validate user inputs. Lambda will update the task status and other info once they are available during the concluding fulfillment phase.  Slack Bot App: We have leveraged the Slack app to enable it as front end of our chat bot. Slack is one of the ideal channel with it’s collaboration and team communication capabilities. It is perfect fit for a team (software project team in this use case). We have created Slack app virtual scrum master app and added it’s bot to software project team slack channel.

The tourist can then view the profile of a tourguide to judge whether or not he/she would be a good fit for them. Even if the tourist doesn\'t wish to contact the tourguide, they can even view the list of reccommended events, places, or experiences to adventure at a certain location. They can then decide when/where they want to meet up, if they decide to do so, and the tourguide can be tipped by the tourist.How We built itOur entire tech stack revolves around meteor.js which combines client and server side code into a single easy to deploy system. Meteor uses MongoDB for the database, and a templating language of HTML5 for the frontend. Much of the dynamic client interfacing and backend interfacing is written in javascript.Challenges We ran intoBefore this hackathon 36 hours ago, none of us had ever touched Meteor.js or had extensive experience with javascript.

With the advantage of using graphs being quite evident; applying machine learning algorithms on graphs can be used for tasks such as graph analysis, link prediction, clustering etc.Graph Embeddings are a way to encode the graph data as vectors that can effectively capture the structural information, such as the graph topology and the node to node relationships in the graph database. These embeddings can then be ingested by ML algorithms for performing various tasksHOW CAN GRAPH EMBEDDINGS BE USED?Graph embeddings can be used to perform various tasks including machine learning tasks.For example, embeddings of two nodes can be used to determine if a relationship can exist between them. Or, given a particular node and a relation, embeddings can be used to find similar nodes and rank them using similarity search algortihmsCommon applications include  knowledge graph completion and drug discovery where new relations can be dicovered between two nodes.

"faceband","Play the band with your friends using facial instruments","[4430, ""Recently more people are using Video chat apps such as Snapchat and Snow. However most functions such as filter and games were used more personally and lacked the concept of communicating. The fun of Video chat is that you can show your emotion at the moment and music is a powerful content to build a win-win connection between artists' creativity and general users' everyday life as if 'Instagram Music Sticker' has done since May 2018. (https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/instagram-stories-music/)Facebook already has dominant active users in social media market. Especially, WhatsApp and Messenger are the first and second globally popular mobile messenger apps, so a multi-play experience can intrigue more engagement from users and communities. Our team thought if people could play with their faces and make something in harmony as a band, it would be much more fun. "", 'faceband is basically a rhythm action game using facial movement effects from facebook or instagram. You can use your face as an interaction to play the notes like opening your mouth or winking. Each player can choose an instrument and build a sort of band and they can play a single song making harmony. ', 'Using Spark AR Studio, we tracked facial movements through the facetracker, and connected them into interaction. For example, a simple wink is a continuous action of, one eye closing and opening/ while the other eye is opened. Then we added a music script, so that when these facial actions are performed in the precise spot, the score would go up. We designed the Graphic elements and layout with sketch, and modeled the instrumental assets with cinema4d. In order to import 3D objects, we used AR Library in Spark AR Studio after uploading them to sketchfab. ', ""There were many obstacles in building the faceband but one of the interesting challenge was deciding which actions we could use, since the actions were limited to the head. When we tested 'shaking your head at the beat' we all got dizzy in a few shakes and thought it would be more like torturing, so we changed the action to slightly tilting the head.We wanted to make a multi-play AR experience, however currently Spark AR Studio doesn't have any feature and resource for an (independent camera user's) multi-play effect. If coming updates can provide creators with such assets and resources, faceband team will definitely use them for the next milestone. "", ""By extending the effects of the camera app, we proposed the possibility of a game implementation, and furthermore, adds communication elements that can be enjoyed together, such as competing by sharing each other's images or combining them into a single content. "", ""We've used Spark AR Studio, MuseScore, MusicXML, and many other tools for the first time and are now familiar with them. "", ""We do not yet use a facemesh, but it might be useful and effective for users who do not want to expose their genuine face or for faceband game to give penalties for missing beats by distorting players' face. Thus, we can update it to the next version.Additionally, if a group of players were able to select music in a library being updated by the music industry, faceband can be another entertainment platform service with messengers integrated with augmented reality.Since we didn't have much time, we only made the process till announcing the winner. But if we could develop more, we think it would be fun if the winner could apply funny filters to the losers while they face chat and make some laughter.

This is useful for people who pick their children by car or walking.The school only need one  or more tablets or iPads to receive notifications and scan the codes of the parents cel phone. When scanning these codes, the school will generate a report containing information of the deliveries: child\'s name, who picked him up, at what time he left, what car or walking, and who delivered the child.Permissions can be given by parents to different people, they are called ""authorized""; every user has an unique code; that code will allow parents to give permissions so the ""authorized"" can pick his kids from school (this can be used when the kids are invited to make homework, have lunch, a party or playing in a friends house) There´s one app for parents, one app for school (both of them available for IOS and Android); and the master control that is operated by the general administrator and school administrators in a computer.

"Context.IO for Drupal &amp; Maildispenser.com","Build email apps in record time without coding","[9781, ""A fellow founder from the Belgian startup community asked me for help with his Context.IO Apps challenge submission. He is not a developer but he is an amazing hustler, so I decided to help him. From my own experience I know how hard it can be for a non-technical startup founder. That is why with my colleagues we built a Graphical UI for Context.IO in Drupal to help anyone who can click their way through a configuration screen make their own email applications.Potential impactThere are just under a 100 thousand users actively contributing to the Drupal project. With the Context.IO module it is now really easy for them to create email applications. We expect that the open sourced Context.IO module will have some or all of the following impact:Some of the sites that currently use Mailhandler will switch over to Context.IOSome of Drupal's 502 distributions (e.g. ticketing packages) will start including the Context.IO module into their downloadable packageSite builders will start using the Context.IO module in their new projectsAdministrators will develop email applications for their organisationsWhen you choose our submission for the competition you give us the funding to further promote it in the community.  "", 'Instead of making a single app, we wanted to create a platform on top of which other people, even non-developers could innovate. That\'s why we built a Drupal module that we\'ve open sourced. We\'ve also built an example implementation that uses the module to address 2 problems we had in our company.The Context.IO module lets you set up feeds in Drupal that will import emails, or data inside your emails into a site. To do so you don\'t need to write a single line of code. You can use our module to make applications that do any or a combination of the following:Import emails that fulfil certain criteria from your email archiveImport emails as they arrive in your mailboxExtract information from email bodies (this currently requires regular expressions, I guess that qualifies as code)Share this information with a selected group of trusted parties that get access to your siteDo certain actions (e.g. schedule, or send an email) when you receive an email that fulfils certain criteriaCreate users in your site every time you receive email from a new address, or when an email gets forwardedDrupal already has a module to import emails: Mailhandler. Drupal.org knows about 2,352 sites that currently use the module and it has been downloaded 62,105 times. The Context.IO module that we built however is superior over Mailhandler for the following reasons:Mailhandler doesn\'t provide options to search and filter emailsMailhandler\'s primary use case is to import mail as it arrives in a mailbox, not to process emails that have been archived.Mailhandler requires you to provide login credentials to the site, and can\'t currently request access using oAuth. As a result it\'s only really fit for single mailbox applications (e.g. a ""reply to"" comment on a forum). So not really for applications that consumers can grant access to their mailbox to.Drupal is one of the leading open source CMSs and is popular with a really large audience ranging from technically savvy consumers all the way through to enterprise organisations (e.g. https://www.whitehouse.gov/ runs on Drupal). While it is comparably easier to set up a Wordpress site, Drupal is more flexible. It\'s with this flexibility in mind that we built the Context.IO module.  ', ""The module is conceived as a building block, compatible with Drupal's massive ecosystem of modules. Since it's a module that implements the Feeds architecture, it allows site builders to configure:A fetcher that uploads emails that fulfil a set of search parameters A parser that extracts information from inside the email into separate fields, to store structured informationA processor that maps the information into native Drupal objects and their fields (e.g. nodes, users, comments) "", ""Overall the API was easy to use, but we had some difficulties with the implementation of the attachment API. We've filed a bug for it on the GitHub project. In the beginning there were some synching issues with my inbox, because of which we couldn't fully test the body import function.Accomplishments that we are proud ofWe've finished the Context.IO module in under 2 weeks.The site that we use in the demo video was built in less than 4 hours.The module is really powerful and plays nice with Drupal's contrib modules. We are really excited about it's potential.In 5 days we had 85 downloads for the module, and it's already reported in use on 3 sites. This is really fast adoption, that I haven't previously seen in my 10 year long Drupal carreer.What we learnedWe had a dependency bug with the Context.IO library and our developers had to freshen up their knowledge about dependency management with libraries in Drupal.Prototyping in Drupal goes really fast and is super fun (I guess that wasn't really news, for us at least)What's next for the Context.IO Drupal moduleWe've published a blogpost about the competition and the module to the Planet Drupal (an RSS feed for the Drupal community). We will be following up with another post about the demo video (also here attached). We'll do another video that is targeted at site builders.We would like to talk with the Context.IO team about community outreach programs in the Drupal communityWe want to still implement attachment handlingWe want to set up a beta invite signup page to check for interest for the prototype that we built. We believe there might be interest for it as a customisable B2B solution.Maildispenser demo implementationSelectively share emailMaildispenser is an application that helps people selectively share emails. With it you can set up filters that will automatically upload emails into an online archive space. Each archive space can be shared with a group of people of your choice. With it, you no longer need to forward your emails or give access to your mailbox. Access permissions are granular: other people only get to see the emails they need, and when they no longer need access you can revoke their permissions. Unlike the native gmail filters that will only forward when they arrive to your inbox, Maildispenser can also help you share old emails. Invoice sharingEarlier this year my assistant who helps me processing my expenses went on pregnancy leave. In the past years I had set up a large number of email filters in Gmail that forwarded invoices to her, now I not only had to redo those filters, I also had to forward a number of invoices that hadn’t been processed yet. If you work with one assistant this is a bit of a hassle, if you work with a number of different people from odesk for example, this can be enough hassle to undue whatever time savings you made using an admin in the first place. You could maybe solve the problem if you forward these mails to a separate mailbox, but then you have to keep changing your credentials for it.With Maildispenser, you can set up a space for your invoices, you can either define a catch all filter, that will upload any email that mentions the word invoice. Or you could define individual filters that only upload emails that originate from a certain address and have a specific type of title, to upload invoices from each of your vendors separately. Once the system is set up you can then give your assistant access to your invoice space. When they are finished with the job, you can revoke their permissions.Email archiveA few months ago we fell out with a customer, as a pre-seed startup they had run out of money. They threatened us with a law suit and played other tricks to try to make us do more and more work for ever shrinking amounts of money.

We believe there might be interest for it as a customisable B2B solution.Maildispenser demo implementationSelectively share emailMaildispenser is an application that helps people selectively share emails. With it you can set up filters that will automatically upload emails into an online archive space. Each archive space can be shared with a group of people of your choice. With it, you no longer need to forward your emails or give access to your mailbox. Access permissions are granular: other people only get to see the emails they need, and when they no longer need access you can revoke their permissions. Unlike the native gmail filters that will only forward when they arrive to your inbox, Maildispenser can also help you share old emails. Invoice sharingEarlier this year my assistant who helps me processing my expenses went on pregnancy leave.

"sizeOf","Precision real world measurements using just a mobile phone camera","[1971, ""The idea for sizeOf came about when Davis saw how much data his DSLR camera gave for his pictures. Using some simple trig we are able to deduce the size of real life object using nothing but the data from the camera and computation. How it worksWith only a picture and some information about the camera and lens, we are able to calculate the approximate real height and width of an object in focus.  Simply point the camera at an object, tap to focus, and drag a crop box around the object of interest to get the real size of that object, in meters.The math is derived from lens formulae and some simple trigonometry.  Challenges I ran intoEvery camera is different, and almost every variable is non-linear.  This makes creating solutions difficult.

"XLTools Suite for Excel","Indispensable Excel apps you need daily – in a single tab.","[5175, 'In our team, we have been using Excel for years. At some point we decided to share our know-hows. That is how XLTools add-in was born. Initially we created it as a VSTO-based add-in written in C#. The product became very successful. So far, XLTools has been downloaded 167,000 times and installed on 45,000 unique PCs across 146 countries.However, VSTO work only on Windows. That is why we were so exited when new the cross-platform JavaScript API appeared. We implemented a subset of the most successful tools from our VSTO add-in and made them cross-platform and mobile friendly. But JavaScript API 1.0 had some limitations:VSTO add-in had a custom tab in the ribbon UI, while the new apps were ""hidden"" on the ""Insert"" tabThere was no way to build  single suite of tools, same as we had built with VSTOWith the JavaScript API 1.1 it all changed. We were very excited with the possibility to create custom tabs and add-in commands for the Excel ribbon UI as well as the ability for central deployment. We decided to build XLTools Suite - an app that bundled all our tools into a single tab. ', 'No matter expert or beginner, XLTools Suite are Excel apps you can actually use daily. Within a single app you get:Calendar - dates editing in Excel made easy. As it always had to be. This useful date picker makes date entry and formatting super simple. Data Cleaning - clean bulk data in a few clicks: redundant spaces, line breaks or non-printing symbols, change text case, etc. Unpivot Table  - redesign crosstab, or 2D tables to a flat list in Excel quickly and accurately. SQL Queries - run SQL queries in Excel and directly against Excel tables: SELECT, JOIN, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, WHERE, SUM, etc. Export to CSV  - convert Excel tables or selected ranges to plain text CSV with custom delimiter and without closing the primary Excel file. Columns Match - match columns against each other or benchmarks and calculate the exact match percentage. Creation of XLTools Suite is truly beneficial for end-users. Instead of adding each app separately, the entire set is added at once, and all tools are readily available from one tab. As developers of productivity apps, we appreciate every possibility to reduce the number of steps required from the end user. We believe productivity begins with the inner drive to do every little thing just a bit easier!How to try itWhile XLTools Suite is under review and not yet available in the AppSource, you can try it as a side loaded add-in. Here is what you need to do:Download and save XLTools Suite Manifest fileLog in to your Office365 account: https://portal.office.comOpen Excel Online and create a new document or download our sample documentOn the Excel ribbon go to Insert -> Office Add-ins -> Click Upload My Add-in (right top corner) -> Select XLTools Suite Manifest file and click ""Upload""Now you should see new ""XLTools"" tab on you Excel ribbon. Enjoy!Note: Due to limitations of the current API (read the next section) the ""Calendar"" button will not insert the calendar pane itself yet, it will open the calendar app page on AppSource instead.Challenges we ran intoWhile add-in commands support task pane apps, they do not yet support content pane apps yet.What\'s next for XLTools SuiteWe have submitted XLTools Suite to AppSource and waiting for it to be publishedWe will continue to migrate most successful tools from our VSTO add-in to XLTools SuiteWe would like to improve our marketing and sales in corporate sector, we hope Hack Productivity 3 and Microsoft can help us with itBuilt Withazurecsshtml5javascriptoffice-js-apioffice-ui-fabricoffice365resttypescriptTry it outgoo.gl      Submitted to    Hack Productivity 3Winner                Best Office 365 Add-in                  Created by  I worked on the script for the promo video and some of the materials for the submission.Maria BalobanovaI helped to develop UI for Mac version.

"Automation for JIRA","The simple way to automate your team!","[4997, ""We wanted to make it easy for JIRA customers to automate their teams' processes.  Current solutions all require deep knowledge of JIRA's APIs or some developer skills to write scripts.  Not all JIRA admins have those skills nor do they want to spend time learning them. Our inspiration was to provide a simple, yet incredibly powerful user experience that hides all the complexity from the user.  We also want to make it easier to integrate JIRA with third party systems. "", ""Automation for JIRA allows any project admin to create powerful automation rules in their project with ease.  At its heart is a simple rule builder that allows users to specify triggers, conditions and actions.  Triggers control when an automation rule begins - they can react to issue events or be scheduled. With conditions project admins can customise rules to only run for issues they care about.  Finally actions perform changes in a system, such as editing an issue, creating sub-tasks or sending SMS notifications via Twilio.Users can combine as many conditions and actions as they like.   We provide some pre-defined templates and on-boarding to help you get started, but the power is really with users to combine automation rule components in exciting new ways!We also offer a free 'Lite' version of Automation for JIRA that's limited to 60 rule executions per month so customers can try it out for as long as they like! Upgrades to the paid version will be seamless with all rules still being there after upgrade. "", 'We built Automation for JIRA on a serverless stack using AWS Lambda, API Gateway and Cloudfront for static resources.  Dynamic parts of the UI are served directly via API Gateway, which makes calls to Lambda to render the initial connect page contents and provides REST resources to fetch and update additional data.  When automation rules execute, they are added to a AWS Kineses queue that is also processed by AWS Lambda.The front-end was built using React and Redux and can be run completely standalone. In fact most of our front-end development was done on a local webpack dev-server using mock REST data. ', ""Getting the initial serverless stack setup with AWS Cloudformation proved trickier and more time consuming than we thought. We investigated several solutions like serverless but couldn't find something that fit so we ended up building our own stack.  Cloudformation coupled with Cloudfront can be very time consuming with every small configuration change sometimes taking 20 mins to run.  On the product side, getting the design of the rule builder right was also very challenging and took a number of iterations to get right.  "", ""Nick and I are both very happy with the final design of the rule builder.  It's incredibly simple, yet very powerful.  We've also added an in product on-boarding tour that should make it very easy for our users to get started with Automation for JIRA.On the technical side we are both proud of the React, Redux, AWS Lambda stack we've developed.  The front-end will make it easy to port this add-on to server in the future and the cloud back-end stack will be an incredibly cost-effective way to host this add-on. "", 'Working on this add-on taught us a lot about the AWS stack and developing a scalable cloud add-on.  We were worried that we could not achieve a fast development speed using this very new serverless Lambda stack.  After a few teething problems with syncing incremental Lambda updates however and our standalone React/Redux front-end stack these fears proved to be unfounded. ', ""We ask for customer feedback directly in the product in a number of places.  With our infrastructure adding more integrations is now incredibly simple and we'll be able to respond to these customer suggestions within a couple of days and build a more fully featured product that will hopefully delight customers!We also want to add more third party integrations to really open up JIRA to other systems in use out there.

"AgriWave: Transforming the Agricultural and Data World","Making waves in the agricultural industry one data set at a time","[8006, ""AgriWave: We're here to deliver a product that connects the agricultural and data digital world using core technologies in modeling and data analytics to enable a variety of consumers to improve productivity, quality, safety, and sustainability. The agricultural industry is valued at $1.3 trillion USD annually, we can work to foster greater agricultural trade with the increase in population and demand for food to come. "", 'AgriWave is a software to transform a broad range of industries such as agriculture and logistics to understand data thoroughly for an economic, efficient, and effective agricultural analyses.We utilize FreeWave technologies in developing countries for the agricultural industries. Freewave can be used in developing countries to gather data on the big three crops: soybeans, corn, and wheat. We focus on irrigation water, electrical energy, dissolved salts, and soil reaction in growing these crops. Irrigation is a vital component of agricultural production, particularly in developing countries. With food production increasing in response to the demands of an expanding population and rising prosperity, irrigated agriculture continues to consume and be the largest user of water in all regions of the world. Agriculture accounts for 93% of water consumption worldwide. The agriculture sector is often criticized for high wastage and inefficient use of water at the point of consumption encouraged by subsidized low charges for water use or low energy tariffs for pumping. We need to understand our water usage for economic, environmental, and ethical purposes.Agriculture is an energy-intensive industry. Agriculture requires energy for important input in production, using energy directly as fuel or electricity to operate machinery and equipment, heat or cool buildings, for lighting on the farm, and indirectly in the fertilizers and chemicals produced off the farm. As farm production becomes more mechanized, the agricultural industry requires timenly energy supplies at particular stages of the production cycle to achieve optimum yields. We need to understand our electrical energy usage for maximum economic and environmental benefits.Water used for irrigation can vary greatly in quality depending upon type and quantity of dissolved salts. These salts originate from dissolution or weathering of the rocks and soil and carried with the water to wherever it is used. Salt content increasing causes severe toxicity, restricting crop yield. We need to understand and evaluate water quality related to salinity, water infiltration rate, and toxicity for greatest economic gain.Plants can tolerate a wide pH range in solution culture, but they cannot tolerate a wide range of acidity in the soil. Soil acidity is volatile and often changes, in turn changing the solubility of a number of metal ions. Plant growth is reliant on these varying concentrations of metals in solution rather than the acidity itself. The aim in managing soil pH is not to achieve a particular pH value, but to adjust the acidity to the point where there are no toxic metals in solution and the availability of nutrients is at its maximum. We need to understand the soil reaction and pH level for maximum economic gain.The weight of crops are important not only to see the growth but also to detect unwanted objects. Being able to sense the weight of a part of crop field and seeing a spike in weight is a sign of potential trespassing and vandalism, an all too common issue in the agricultural industry. We need to see the weight of crops not only for economic gain but for vandalism purposes as well to ensure security and safety of the agricultural industry. ', ""With a lot of help from caffeine, we used Laravel's PHP framework to build a full stack web application that can analyze and display hypothetical data from developing country farmland potentially using FreeWave radios. We used n3 charts to create a consumer friendly data analysis page where one can see varying farm data to keep track and understand what exactly is going on. "", 'For half of our team, this was our first Hackathon and we had no idea what to expect. We spent the first few hours going through many different ideas and getting overwhelmed with everything. Laravel, the main component of our project, was also completely new to most of us.  ', ""We are super excited to be able to apply our learned academic skills in addition to those we just learned on the spot today for real life applications in the world's largest industry.  "", 'In general, the whole concept of a Hackathon was new to us, and we learned how the entire process works. Throughout our project creation process, we started from step one where we went through several ideas and learned how to rule out projects and create outlines quickly due to the time restriction.

"Nimbus","Une flotte d'autobus intelligents à la demande.","[3493, ""Étant un groupe d'étudiants dans une ville aussi active que Montréal, il nous est souvent arrivé de nous retrouver dehors, tard le soir, sans plus aucun métros en circulation. Le moyen le plus économique, pour de modestes étudiants est donc le réseau de nuit de la STM (Société des Transports de Montréal). Malheureusement les arrêts desservis par ce réseau spécial sont très irréguliers, et il nous est souvent arriver d'attendre plus de 30min, dans le froid, en pleine nuit, à un arrêt. C'est de cette souffrance qu'est née notre idée de Nimbus.Nimbus, qu'est-ce que c'est?Nimbus c'est une flotte de véhicules au concept novateur, en effet, au lieu d'avoir des trajets fixes comme il se fait actuellement, la flotte de véhicule Nimbus se dispatchent de manière synchrone en prenant des trajets non fixés préalablement mais qui dépendent de la demande des utilisateurs. Les trajets sont recalculés en temps réel en permanence pour offrir une trajectoire en tout temps optimale, limitant ainsi le temps d'attentes des usagers! Comment l'a-t-on fait?Pour mettre sur pieds Nimbus, nous avons mis au point une web app qui sert de vitrine pour le system de monitoring de la flotte. Nous avons programmé tout le back-end en Python à l'aide du framework Django, pour la partie front-end, Javascript/ReactJS ont su faire le boulot pour le niveau de dynamisme dont nous avions besoin.Nos defisOn a dû attaquer le fameux « travelling salesman problem » pour trouver les trajectoires les plus efficaces incluant les points d’embarquement et de descente. Cet algorithme, grand classique de sa catégorie nous a causé bien du fil à retordre, tant bien même que nous nous sommes, après plusieurs heures à essayer d'implémenter notre prople solution, résolu à passer par un API qui nous a permi de faire abstraction des notions de maths poussés conduisant à sa résolution. Ainsi, nous avons pu nous consacrer à d'autres problématiques que l'API ne prenait pas en compte et dont nous avons dû construire le business logic pour mener à bien notre projet. Nos accomplissementsOn est extrêmement fiers du résultat final! On a finalisé une web app capable de calculer la meilleure trajectoire en fonction des besoins de tous les passagers en recevant les coordonnées GPS du passager ainsi que de sa destination comme input.L'experience qu'on en a tiréEn n'ayant que 24h à travailler sur un problème aussi ambitieux on a surtout appris à gérer notre temps en fonction de nos priorités (et oui, on a appliqué l'algorithme d'optimisation sur nous même finalement). En effet, notre idée de base était beaucoup plus vaste et comportait beaucoup plus de fonctionnalités, mais faute de temps, nous avons dû éliminer celles qui ne nous aurait pas forcément bénéficier sur le court-terme. Et pour aprèsNimbus a le potentiel d’améliorer la qualité de service offert par la société de transport de Montréal d’une manière significative. Après avoir introduit leur passagers à ce système pour les autobus de nuits, la STM pourrait proposer ce type de service pour tous les autobus en dehors des heures de pointe, ce qui leur permettra de fournir un service de meilleure qualité tout en étant efficaces et économiques.Built Withamazon-web-servicesapihtml5javascriptnginxpythonreacttspTry it outwww.github.com      Submitted to    Hackatown    Created by  Kevyn Bele-BindaMohamed CoulibaliIon Banaru "", ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['python', 'react', 'javascript', 'html5', 'amazon-web-services', 'tsp', 'nginx', 'api']","False","36","['ion4', 'freezky', 'konoufo']","https://firefly-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/usercontent/fill/242/161/cGhvdG9zL3Byb2R1Y3Rpb24vc29mdHdhcmVfdGh1bWJuYWlsX3Bob3Rvcy8wMDAvNDcwLzcyNi9kYXRhcy9vcmlnaW5hbC5qcGc=/devpost_7.jpg?signature=0d10e0534f73496fc4218b7c42f86a5be44c47d9","False","0"

"Taxicabs Mobility Challenge","Taking a cab in Morocco just got faster, cheaper, and safer ","[4821, 'We mostly got inspired from our journey taking cabs in Casablanca and how difficult, costly and frustrating it may be, we tried to memorize as much memories as we can and write down each type of difficulty we had, then we moved on to actually doing some brainstorming to put ideas and features together, so we took a look at some well known apps on the market and we tried to understand the importance of each feature they put and how they put it, then we finished by having some chit chat with taxi drivers to get as much insights as possible to really build an app that can benefit them in a daily basis as well. ', ""Our app is being built with one thing in mind, making life of passengers and taxi drivers as easy as it can be, so we went from giving passengers the ability to order a taxi with just a few clicks anytime, everywhere they are, to actually start saving money and taking cost efficient rides by either joining other people's ride or create their own and share it with other people to join.In the other hand, the driver has pretty much the same benefits, saving time by taking scheduled rides with just a few clicks without the hassle of phone calls and picking up passengers that already exist in the current zone, without forgetting the possibility of the system making you more money doing just that.All of this is backed up with an inner rating system for passengers and drivers to make sure you are in safe hands by having the ability to check someone's reputation.How i built itWe build it with the Ionic framework, it's a front-end SDK for building cross-platform mobile apps, which means that this app can be run on android as well as ios phones, Ionic also provides a platform for integrating services like push notifications and analytics. I chose to use NoSql with Mongodb server in order to get queries as fast as possible, and i'm using Node.js on the server side of the application, which can support an incredible number of network communication synchronously.Challenges i ran intoThe features that we had in mind to implement is numbered in comparison with the time we had in hands.Testing the app looking for bugs took a lot of time than expected.Fitting a well demonstrative script of quite a lot features in less than 5 min in a video was a bit challenging for us.Accomplishments that i'm proud ofThis is our first competition, so we were really excited about it and we're really proud of our accomplishment because in any case, we'd always feel that we actually tried to make somebody's life out there easier and that feeling for us is priceless.What i learnedWe learned that a lot of things can seem easy to implement but it takes up a lot of your time and energy, so you need to have some risk management for your project to deliver it in due time without having a negative impact on quality work, we also learned some stress controlling techniques that we enforced our bodies and mind to apply due having tons of work to do in the development period as 1 person as full stack developer and 1 person as a professional digital marketer and designer.Whats next for Ford Code for TaxiCabs Mobility Challenge:We are really excited and looking forward to get more engaged in the upcoming challenges and we sincerely thank everyone that put any kind of work in this to make it happen.Built Withionicnode.jsTry it outplay.google.complay.google.com      Submitted to    Ford Code for Taxicabs Mobility ChallengeWinner                SUPINFO Scholarship Award                  Created by  I worked in the back-end using nodejs, and in the front-end with angularjs and the Ionic framework, it was my first time using Ionic, which was a little intimidating, but I learned a TON about mobile developement.Abdelhakim LahrachA highly motivated and hard-working individual.

"CubeBot ","Size and Speed Optimized Rubik's Cube Solving Robot","[2871, 'Boredom ', ""Solves cubes autonomously.How We built itHundreds of hours of Solidworks, Python, Arduino, gluing, and staring at a 3D printer extruder.Other than the previously mentioned Pi and Arudino and glue, we also used 9 servo motors (RIP 1 servo motor due to incorrect wiring), duct tape, tears, and PLA. Other tools used but not included were scissors and a file. The file proved to be very useful due to our subpar 3D printer. The programming was done in C, Python, and the Arduino IDE. Basically what happens is Python is used to determine the colors of the cube using OpenCV, a C program solves the cube using Kociemba's Algorithm, and a Python program converts the output of the C program to an optimized move order specific to our hardware. The move sequence is then passed  to the Arduino, which assigns servo rotation sequences to each move, does a bit of turning, and solves the cube.The C implementation of the Kociemba Algorithm was primarily acquired from online sources however a few modifications were added to fit our design.Challenges We ran intoIn order to minimize volume, we made all the hardware as compact as possible. This required extensive thought when designing 3D printed components in Solidworks, and it became especially difficult when optimizing camera position. In order to have the device wireless and completely self contained, we utilized a Raspberry Pi camera, which unfortunately has a field of view of less than 50 degrees. In order to scan an entire side of the cube, the camera had to be mounted in a hole drilled beneath the cube with special lighting surrounding it. Additionally, software modification was necessary to slightly shift the cube in order to accurately view all nine cubelets. Also, our 3D printer was, you could say, not good. Printing parts took many many attempts and many, many hours. In the end, however, it seems like it works. Thank you super glue.What we are proud ofWe are very proud of CubeBot's small figure, minimal cost, and ability to solve a cube quickly. The entire project cost around $150, while starter Lego Mindstorm kits start at $400. And our best analysis and solve time is 35s.What We learnedPrototyping hardware projects requires a lot of time, especially when 3D printed components are utilized. The 3D printed components were critical for this project, however, in order to make custom fitting components. Also, before this, we did not have much experience with OpenCV, so that was fun.What's next for CubeBotCubeBot now lives on a shelf and has a dim future.

And now with the advent of the world of IoT devices it has never been easier or more accessible to start such a project. However we don't all have the knowledge, experience or even desire to spend time and effort on building dashboards and tools to interact with our IoT devices, sensors and other hardware. So we wanted to provide a way for any IoT project to get set up with a quick web/mobile visualisation as easily as possible.

', ""We worked as team with each member focussing on their strengths and stronger areas of knowledge. We decided to write our code using as many of the newest features as possible with Meteor. This meant choosing Angular for the front end dashboards which now has excellent support in Meteor. In addition we made a conscious effort to write all code in as much of an 'es6/ecmascript2015' style as possible with the new support in the framework. For our first proof of concept we used a Particle (previously known as Spark) Core IoT device which was in turn connected up to a temperature sensor for real time data capture. The intention was to add more devices and sensors as quickly as possible. Our application design implemented a user flow for adding new devices to their accounts and profiles. Once a device and it's authentication details had been added to the platform our IoThingies application can immediately start querying this device for any methods, variables or data sets which may be available for collection and inspection.

"ShortStock","ShortStock uses ML neural networks to filter and customise news releases about companies to varied investing styles","[6881, ""Investing is an art, not a science. In global money flow markets dictated by growth and value investing, individuals often look at a myriad of non-financial news updates beyond financial analytics of a company on issues including management, innovation, and expansion to guide decision-making. But, not all investors have the same principles or styles even when looking at similar firms: thus, while generic updates can be found by the Google Engine or NASDAQ, there exists a deep information asymmetry since it is difficult to find tailored relevant news that truly affect a specific individual's cognitive processes. Thus, we were inspired to build a full-stack application that displays news reports to an investor and which, based on user feedback (relevant/not relevant), continuously 'learns' investor's style to better present relevant articles about a firm to aid investing activities. "", ""ShortStock essentially creates a customized news feed of investing-relevant developments surrounding a company to best support an individual investor. Its web interface takes a company ticker as input and passes it through Google News API to find recent articles. The code help scrape news reports into lists of important phrases, then compared to a keyword database to find most relevant tags/categories for each article. These tags are subsequently inputted into our machine learning algorithm which uses previous data sets to determine whether the investor is likely to find the article relevant (and hence must be displayed) or not. Quick summaries and URLs of the relevant chosen articles are then based back to the investor on the webpage. Each article is accompanied by radio buttons for the investor to determine helpful/ not helpful which then updates the ML algorithm's training set for more optimized future results.  "", 'The application first renders an interface webpage built on Bootstrap (HTML, CSS) to take the ticker input. Control in the program is passed to a central flask code (running on a local flask server) that receives data by POST. Using modules in file structure, the code calls Google News API and runs article URLs through BeautifulSoup and Diffbot Article API to find the aforementioned list of main phrases. Our database handling downloads keyword dictionary by SQL and then uses a matching algorithm in O(n2) to compare each phrase to the entire dictionary. The frequency-of-occurence for each tag determines the final relevant category for the article, which the flask server then passes to our ML neural network. Using multi-layer perceptron that trains using backpropagation and LBFGS, we use the Cross-Entropy loss function and in-built regularization functions to create a \'usefulness matrix\' of binary values. The output of relevance binaries is then mapped to the article list to dump our relevant reports onto, and render, the final HTML page. The user\'s submission of ""helpful""/""not helpful"" on the final page passes control back to the Flask server to run SQL queries that add said new entries to the the investor\'s specific training dataset on the database for future use.  ', 'While our code functioned effectively as individual components (database management, algorithm design, API and front-end), integrating them into a full stack with the flask interface turned out to be our singular defining problem through the hackathon. There were often inconsistencies across the data types and models that were used, making the internal transfer of control and information difficult. This integration issues were exasperated by difference in versions of softwares as well as difference in syntax across the programming languages combined in the stack. Furthermore, we also experienced issues in adjusting the dimensionality of our neural network input and the time complexity of our relevance algorithm (we had to restrict our articles to 7 to ensure manageable speed).  ', 'Over the entire duration of our hackathon, we were proud of having addressed our integration issues in achieving an efficient flow of control across the program stack for seamless input and data transfer. We are also proud of having learnt, implemented and debugged an entire new language - Flask - over the course of just this hackathon since it was an integral part of our project.

Firstly, we would improve run-time complexity of our major algorithms, including ML, API reading and web-scraping in order to accommodate more articles into a manageable time frame. We would also use a larger training set for our neural network to improve predictive accuracy, along with support for multiple tags for each article (such that information can belong at the very intersections of a matrix than simply categories).

We separated into two teams - one team focused on the bot, and another focused on the native application.

"planet.AR.y","An immersive augmented reality experience paired with Alexa to engage and teach kids about our solar system!","[8734, 'Ever since we were young children, we wanted to explore the universe as we both had a common passion for space and astronomy. Originally, we thought of creating a voice driven skill that took advantage of Amazon’s Alexa Voice Service that told stories to children. However, we realized there were two essential flaws with this idea. The first was that stories required little to no user interaction and we really wanted to harness the potential of using voice with Amazon Alexa. The second main flaw was that as humans, we are better visual learners than we are auditory (nearly 7 times more)!  To solve this, we created a dynamic augmented reality experience that immerses children in a new environment and helps them learn about the solar system and satisfy their curiosity. ', 'Users can download and launch the app which will be available on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store. The app presents an augmented reality interface and projects a window into the solar system using the rear camera of the device. The skill then interfaces with this app and allows users to ask questions about the planet they are looking at, including its distance to the sun, some brief information about the planet, and more interesting details.  ', 'The process of building this application was quite tedious and challenging, but it can be broken up into various modules.Load Unity and Vuforia and create models of all the planets with an ImageTarget that maps the planets to each other and a reference frame.Create an Alexa Skill in the Skill Builder portal and define the interaction models as well as the intent schema. This sets up the framework for the behavior of our skill.Create a Node.JS server that interfaces with the Amazon Alexa and translates the various intents into requests that can be passed on.Create another intermediary server that interfaces with both the Unity application and the Alexa skill by using HTTP requests to pass data between the phone and Alexa. Deploy the Node.JS servers onto a cloud based platform service such as Heroku that can run web apps from a stable and fast server.Step 1: Create a Unity application using VuforiaThe first step is to install Unity with the Vuforia package which allows for the creation of augmented and virtual reality apps. On the Vuforia website, you can generate a database with an image target that renders your content on top of a specified image, which it uses as a reference point. In this case, we used a picture of a rocketship to go along with the space theme.  Next, we had to download 3D models of all planets and position them accurately relative to each other. Step 2: Building the Alexa SkillThe next step was to create the skill in the Alexa Skill builder. We had to write out all the utterances for our skill and define the intent schema in order to create the backbone of our skill. This was fairly straightforward as it takes you step by step through the process. Step 3: The NodeJS Alexa Facing SkillWe decided not to use Lambda and instead create our own custom HTTP server that interfaces with the Amazon Echo. To do so, we used Node.JS and Express as well as a variety of other modules to make this task simpler. The server handles a variety of intent requests and returns a response after sending an HTTP request to the middle server which will be discussed in the next step.Step 4: The Intermediary ServerIn order to link the Alexa skill to the Unity application, we created another HTTP server that acted as a bridge between the phone and Unity application. The server sent HTTP requests to the Unity Application, which then responded with the nearest planet relative to the camera using a custom C# script. The server also responds to the Alexa Skill Server.Step 5: Deploying to HerokuWe decided to deploy our Node.JS servers on heroku in order to give it a static url as well as ensure that our servers stayed up. You have to create a file called Procfile.txt, and inside type:web server.jsThen, it’s as simple as posting the project on a Github repository and setting Heroku up to follow any commits made in that repository.How to use itEnable the Alexa Skill by asking Alexa to enable Reality Planets.Download the companion app from the link below or from the link Alexa will send to your phone.Ask Alexa to pair your phone and enter the code it gives you in the app you downloaded.Open the image down below on another device or print it out.Use the app to point at the picture and display the planets.Ask Reality Planets about the planet to get information about it. ', 'Unity does not support hosting an HTTP server that can handle incoming requests and it was extremely difficult to transfer information between the phone and the intermediary server.To establish a link between the Unity application and the Alexa skill, we needed a way to know which instance of the app was making requests in order to delivery information to the correct device.We had trouble with Unity resolving some Vuforia components, preventing us from working on multiple computers and merging our changes.When creating 3D models of all the planets, we had trouble resolving their textures and did not know how to create .mat (material) files that could be used.During testing we had issues using a tunneling reverse proxy (ngrok) as it repeatedly crashed and was unstable for our uses.The C# environment that Unity uses caused us some troubles as we had never used it previously.Our Heroku requests often failed because the servers were set to fall asleep after a set time periodChallenge 1 Fix:We solved this by creating two different servers that could handle HTTP requests and allowed for the information from the Unity application (Planet) to be passed on to the Alexa skill. This was then processed through the various intents for each piece of information we wanted to deliver to the user (planet description, orbit time, diameter, and distance).Challenge 2 Fix:We used a server to bridge Alexa and the app in order to generate a unique UID that paired both of them in their own isolated instance. Alexa creates a one time alphanumeric seven character sequence that it then prompts the user to enter. This initiates a link between the two.Challenge 3 Fix:We were forced to use only one computer to run Unity on as it would compile properly on others.Challenge 4 Fix:We fixed this issue by learning how to convert satellite jpg or png images into that specific file type so that the .obj files would accept them as an overlay and so the planets would appear in color.Challenge 5 Fix:We deployed to Heroku to mitigate the issues we had with ngrok.Challenge 6 Fix:We learned the nuances of the language and restarted Unity which fixed a lot of the issues.Challenge 7 Fix:We used a Heroku App called Kaffeine to ping it every 30 minutes and keep it always running. ', 'We learned how to interface Unity and Alexa, which was very tricky and can help in future projects.We gained mastery of HTTP requests and NodeJS, as there were a lot of moving parts and requests that needed to be routed properly.A lot of the code for the servers and Unity can be repurposed for augmented reality applications that require connection to other platforms.Creating apps that work on other important platforms. We learned how to create an iOS app using Xcode for the first time.VUI Design for the Alexa Skill + Unity Application and the Javascript servers involved ', 'How to make a great Alexa skill that is accessible to all children and being able to provide a new way to learn about planets that was unique and not previously integrated with a voice platform. We also learned about the various hurdles that needed to be overcome to build a successful skill. ', 'We hope to add different planets, moons, solar systems, and animate various orbits.

"Planet Ally: Travel Agents of Change","Informing and empowering LGBTIQ and allies about the travel choices they make.","[14922, 'The planet, as a global community, needs people working together as allies to create forward progress. It is in this shared togetherness that I want to create a tool(s) of empowerment that helps users make informed choices.Simply being gay doesn’t automatically make someone aware of their rights in countries they travel. Allies often learn something later and say, “I had no idea, if I had known I would have made a different decision.” It is exactly these kinds of reactions that made me realize I want to find ways to activate awareness and allyship from within our global community.  It is both the LGBTIQ person and the well-intentioned ally who need easily distributable tools of empowerment to help them make choices that are right for them. In targeting both groups simultaneously I want to support our global community in becoming a Planet of Allies.As a social media activist and specialist, I have instinctively started to crowd source this idea and have created a Global Advisory team, made up of amazing thought leaders and activists to help me best work through the labyrinth of opportunities and challenges as we embark on this journey. ', 'Planet Ally, in its first iteration, is a mobile friendly website, that focuses on travel and the LGBTIQ, with a particular focus on allyship and solidarity. Planet Ally empowers LGBTIQ and allies to make informed travel decisions. It arms travellers with the information they need to make decisions that are right for them based on their own views and values.

We knew that would be hard but had hoped to attract developers and coders a lot earlier in the process.As we are in our infancy in the tech/hack space a big challenge was knowing how to even articulate what we want to do and achieve. We were fortunate enough 4 days out to find the most amazing and tirelessly committed word press guy in Kenton!Naturally with a team across the globe, and me having to travel in the middle made it difficult but the team were so committed and motivated, I was humbled to see how far they have gone and how much they have put into this. We are a leaderful team and that was key when we handed over from HK, New Jersey and Sydney!We used @slackhq throughout and it was very helpful keeping us in touch and on track. We tried to reach out to seek more support from the LGBTIQ travel community but alas our deadline was just too tight.  We have limited skills as a team in design and coding so that has taken much time, we would hope moving forward we could benefit from having quality production but hope our work is still able to convey the larger vision that we have re coding and production value etc.Another challenge given Planet Ally is so information-driven was access to updated information from NGOs and official government websites etc. We used tweets and DMs both on Twitter and Facebook to crowd source information and access to data and reports etc.Going forward I would like to take the time to verify information and accuracy with trusted local partners, consulting with our global advisory and conducting interviews on the ground etc.Overall, we tackled a big project with a large scope, over 3 continents, so consistently raining in and focusing on making something that worked and was presentable was hard, but we did it! I am so proud of every one of our team, who absolutely went above and beyond and now are all keen to take Planet Ally to the next step! ', ""Personally, I'm an out Australian expat rainbow Mum and professional activist living in Hong Kong. My wife flies as a Captain for Cathay Pacific. We travel a lot, especially for our youngest son's medical appointments (he has cochlear implants and is going blind). Being an out woman, being a mother, being an expat, being a traveller, being an activist, being a professional networker – I wear a lot of hats and I’ve become a member of a lot communities.I'm proud that I have been able to have a concept that has resonated and enabled me to gain support and commitments from some of my favourite and most influential global activists and thought leaders. Before the Hack4Equality came along Planet Ally was something I was talking about this idea but not acting upon it, truth be told I was overwhelmed as to how to even kick off!It's incredible in such a short space in time to have the support and the ear of VIPs like: Geena Rocero (Gender Proud) Matt Beard (All Out) , Lia Parifax (Arcus and Athlete Ally), Nigerian activist Bisi Alimi, LGBTI academic Lee Badgett, MTV Genderqueer star Jacob Tobia, Swedish activist and technologist Nadia Zabehi and to my shock and delight Indian Prince Manvendra to name a few. I'm turning 40 in a few weeks and I have been passionate about wanting to make Planet Ally happen, I just didn't know how. I planned and still do plan to use using my birthday as a 'hack for human capital'. I will be walking all my friends – mums, dads, athletes, artists, activists, allies, you name it – through this first iteration of Planet Ally to gain as much insight, feedback and inspiration as possible. Creating and curating Planet Ally is the next phase in my activist career.       Hack4Equality is the most spectacularly serendipitous opportunity and I just can not thank all involved enough for the gift it's given my team and I to really think what about our hopes, vision and next steps are for Planet Ally.I am also thrilled we have built a platform that other apps and technologies could plug into (including fellow hackathon entries e.g. #Hack4Equality Turn Out app for volunteers) "", ""I have learned so much. I was overwhelmed by how to execute and how to update information - particularly safety issues and we didn't manage to address enough yet – but we managed to come up with a first iteration that begins to tease out my grandiose ideas into a functioning, practical, usable website. For future iterations, we need to have a better project management scope with deliverables and assigned tasks.Truthfully I was worried that I wasn't ready to share this in such a high-profile space BUT the opportunity to participate and learn from the incredible brains trust assembling for #Hack4Equality is a rare and incredible chance to bring Planet Ally to fruition!What's Next for Planet AllyWe want to address corporate spaces; regional and global travel mobility issues and especially those travelling overseas to work or considering relocating with their partner etc. We look forward to building some corporate partnerships and hoped to have had more on workplace travel on our site but simply ran out of time. We also intend to attract students who are travelling interstate or overseas and give them the best information and resources to make an informed decision.Our vision for the app and site is to enable users to navigate the site intersectionally via filter functions that allow you to self-identify according to gender, race, ethnicity, ability, family etcPlanet Ally seeks to be the world’s most influential and social media savvy group of professional LGBTIQ, ally activists, and other prominent thought leaders. Through these partnerships Planet Ally will create edgy and informative video content, curate content using a strong and engaging social media strategy, host online panels derived from our global network to educate and discuss country-specific issues, and provide relevant educational, news, and crowd sourced content. Planet Ally is a for-profit initiative social enterprise, but one that gives back to the communities and NGOs working for inclusion, diversity, and equality. We will also support vulnerable and volatile countries and regions who most need support and visibility. It will be a travel app that rather than focusing on fluffy pillows, mini bar contents or spa treatments, will focus on knowing your rights, evaluating attitudes and most importantly being clear on whether any money you spend ends up supporting regimes that are anti LGBTIQ.The app will provide information that clearly presents facts on destinations with information on laws, airline carriers, hotel groups, community organizations, social spaces, and so on, so app users can make informed travel choices while also knowing their rights are on the ground. It will aggregate data and distill information into an easy to understand rating system for both destinations, as well as, travel related businesses. It will present:Provide an ‘official view’ which will be based on law, policy, financial stakes, and so on. Provide a curated ‘View from the street’ which will be crowd-sourced opinion from the user-base.

"Free Feet","Improving mobility, one step at a time.","[6160, ""Free Feet treats gait freezing, a symptom which affects approximately 72% of people with Parkinson's. Every hour, someone in the UK is diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, showing just how large the scale of the problem I'm trying to treat is. The inspiration behind Free Feet came from when I was discussing treatments for Parkinson's patients, at  the kitchen table, with my brother, who is a movement disorders (Parkinson's) nurse. He said that there weren't many treatments available for gait freezing, so I decided to see what I could do to help. This is where the idea of Free Feet was born. I also have an emotional connection to Parkinson's as I have a neighbour who sufferers from the illness, so I knew the impact that both gait freezing, and Parkinson's can have on quality of life. This really inspired me to pursue and develop my idea, as there is no known cure for Parkinson's, finding new ways of treating it is really important.How it worksFree Feet treats gait freezing in Parkinson's Disease. It is a laser device attached to the side of a shoe which is designed to help reduce gait freezing for Parkinson's sufferers. Gait freezing is a very common symptom which affects approximately 72% of people with Parkinson's, it is a shuffling movement in the legs and feet. The laser places a red dot on the ground in front of the user. This then changes the users walking from being automatic to non-automatic. This is really important, as in Parkinson's, there is a deficiency in the neurotransmitter (chemical) dopamine. Dopamine is responsible for movement and muscular action, so when there's a deficiency in dopamine, reduced mobility also occurs. However, the midbrain is more severely affected than the frontal lobes. Free Feet works by enabling the user to change their walking from being automatic to non-automatic, when they focus on the dot. This is really important, as it means that the user employs the frontal lobes instead of the midbrain, meaning there is more dopamine available to them, and therefore more ability for movement to occur, thus decreasing the severity of the gait freezing episode. Small scale clinical trials, which we have carried out in collaboration with the Galway Parkinson's Association have shown very positive results, with an approximate decrease in freezing severity of 40%.Challenges I ran intoI have faced many challenges in the development of Free Feet, as being a young woman in STEM, I have always been in the minority of my peer group. I have faced the challenge of overcoming the barrier of youth, as in professional situations, such as networking events, it is hard to ensure that you and your ideas are taken seriously and that your work is appreciated for its full value. An example of this I like to share is a networking event which I attended recently, and because of my age, I was asked if I was looking for one of my parents. I thought that this was certainly a situation in which I was not being taken seriously, and overcame that challenge by explaining my presence and work. I have also faced the challenge of balancing my work and school life, whilst working on the development of Free Feet, I have completed the A-Level equivalent exams (Irish Leaving Certificate) and earned my first choice course in University (Biotechnology). I thought that this was quite a challenge, as I had to balance my time and resources very carefully, but it worked out for the better in the end!I also faced the challenge of learning the technical skills necessary to build the prototype of the device. Free Feet is a device which I built myself, at my kitchen table. In order to do this I needed to learn electronics, soldering and stitching skills, and they were quite the challenge to master!Accomplishments that I'm proud ofI'm very proud that I have successfully trialled a medical device which I created at my kitchen table, and have found that it could help reduce the severity of gait freezing by such a vast percentage.I'm really proud, that against the odds, and people telling me that it would not be possible, I've kept making progress with the commercialisation of my device. I'm very proud that I have recieved the backing of my national medical device association, the IMDA, and that they believed in me and my abilities enough to invest in my personal development.I'm also really proud that developing my device now means, that I have, at my fingertips, the potential to help millions of people around the world suffering from Parkinson's disease. I think that it is really fantastic to be able to reach out and help others through technology, and I'm immensely proud of what I have achieved thus far. I'm really proud of getting into the outbox incubator, its something that I never thought would have been possible for me to achieve, and I'm just delighted.I was really proud to get the opportunity to present Free Feet to our national minister for health, and to learn that he was very impressed with it was fantastic, he said that he hopes to see it in use in the very near future.What I learnedI learnt a lot about how a company works and how to properly forecast financial expenditure. I also learnt more about brand image and how to appropriatly convert that to the consumer. This has led to me being much more conscious regards the logo aand web presence of the business.What's next for Free FeetFree Feet now needs funds in order to be able to reach its full potential.

"RoboCop","Emergency Automated Silent Caller","[3463, 'Last week I was reading a newspaper when I came across a story about how two women were brutally beaten (one of whom eventually died) after a home invader found them hiding under a bed. When asked why she didn\'t call the police immediately, the women said she was scared if the phone made noise or if she talked too loud the intruder would hear and find them. This story was very unsettling, and after some research I found it wasn\'t a rare occurrence either. There are over 3 million home invasions and burglaries in the US every year, and nearly half of those invaders are lethally armed. These victims who were killed by invaders were people: they had lives, families, friends, and they should have had futures too. My goal was to find a way to stop these lethal situations from happening, and to save the lives of future victims.How it worksRoboCop allows a person to silently and quickly call emergency services without the need to speak or spend time dialing and then explaining the situation. Within seconds of opening the app the police are called and given your GPS coordinates. Any additional information you give the service, such as exact location in the building or your current situation, will be translated from text to speech using IBM\'s Watson and sent to the police station using IBM Bluemix and Twilio.Challenges I ran intoBoth the accuracy of location and sending out the call quickly were important to get emergency services to the user as rapidly as possible. Seconds can make the difference between life and death in some cases, and we had to ensure we could balance these two components to minimize response time. By allowing the app to send new information as it became available, rather than all at one time, we were able to allow near instant calling when the app is opened.Accomplishments that I\'m proud of & What I learnedBecause almost every emergency service call center in the US cannot receive text or non-audio information and home invasions are a real danger, we are proud that our app has the potential to save lives that might have otherwise been lost. I have never worked on an app before, and have mostly just worked in data science. Many of the components and steps in this project were completely new to me, but I didn\'t give up!What\'s next for RoboCopUsing a custom phone launcher, we hope to be able to add a ""stealth call"" feature that calls the police based off of a button click combination (ex.- power button clicked and then volume-up button clicked four times) so the service can be used without the use of a screen and while still in a person\'s pocket. This might be useful to those in situations where they need to call the police but cannot due to a person watching them such as during a mugging or a physically abusive relationship.Built Withandroidbluemixbootstrapcsshtml5ibm-watsoniosjavascriptphonegapsmartphonetwiliowindows-phone      Submitted to    HackUMassWinner                Communication Innovation Award              Winner                Finalist              Winner                Champion              Winner                IBM Bluemix Cloud Development Innovation Award                  Created by  Frontend, UX, presentation, etc..David NearyRhode Island and Massachusetts.

"best ethereum wallet ever","a secure local Ethereum wallet with hardware wallet support in Brave","[6747, 'As security geeks, we wanted a local Ethereum wallet with a small attack surface, a front-end easy enough for non-technical users to use securely, and hardware wallet support. None of the existing options met our needs; for instance:Mist still runs Chromium 54, which was released in April of last year, and thus is vulnerable to old Chromium vulnerabilities. In fact this caused them to issue a severe security alert recently: https://blog.ethereum.org/2017/12/15/security-alert-chromium-vulnerability-affecting-mist-browser-beta/. Furthermore Mist runs without Chromium\'s renderer sandbox, so many high-severity vulnerabilities in Chromium are actually critical vulnerabilities in Mist that can lead to full system compromise. Mist\'s advice is ""don\'t browse to untrusted websites"", but it\'s unclear that non-technical users can practically follow this advice, since Mist makes it easy to browse to untrusted websites in their Electron interface.MetaMask lacks hardware wallet support. https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/717wallet.ethereum.org is a remote website with poor XSS protection since it doesn\'t define a Content Security Policy. Furthermore, websites lack the same level of code integrity as apps since they are not signed/versioned and can be modified without detection by the server operator at any time. Thus an attacker only needs to compromise the wallet.ethereum.org web server in order to compromise its users\' wallets. In addition, websites are prone to phishing attacks.Same with MyEtherWallet, although they now have a Chrome extension. However, it\'s unclear whether to what extent the extension is stable or recommended. (See https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/issues/1406#issuecomment-352719852 for instance.)Parity runs a local web interface. This is a great approach but their app is not code-signed and previously on MacOS was downloaded over plain HTTP (https://github.com/paritytech/homebrew-paritytech/issues/65). It is also not the most friendly tool for non-technical users, since it requires downloading a command line tool (https://paritytech.github.io/wiki/Setup) and running terminal commands. This state of affairs was concerning to us. You shouldn\'t have to be a security expert in order to have a secure Ethereum wallet! ', ""We integrated an Ethereum wallet in Brave browser (https://brave.com). All you have to do is install Brave and flip a switch to get a secure, local Ethereum wallet.Features include:1-click wallet creationLaunch the wallet directly from the Brave toolbar1-click shortcut to transfer funds from the ETH wallet into Brave's builtin BAT walletKeys are only stored client-sideUses geth light sync by default, so you're synced in minutes (or even seconds if you're not on the ethdenver wifi).Supports hardware wallets like Ledger and TrezorUses a strict Content-Security-Policy to defend against XSS (no inline scripts except those that are hash-whitelisted, no remote connections except to https://min-api.cryptocompare.com https://mini-api.cryptocompare.com)All open sourceBrave is up-to-date with the latest upstream Chromium release and enables sandboxing on all platformsAutomatically watches BAT token contract "", 'We added three main new components to Brave:a geth binary, which is run as a subprocess of Brave. It is downloaded during the Brave build process.a slightly-modified version of the wallet.ethereum.org front-end (which is also used in Mist): https://github.com/ethereum/meteor-dapp-wallet. Our fork is published as an open-source NPM package from https://github.com/brave/meteor-dapp-wallet-prebuilt and downloaded during the Brave build process.a Brave extension which implements the local ETH wallet UI and the toolbar shortcuts.This is all implemented in https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/pull/13177.  ', ""The wallet.ethereum.org front-end is built on Meteor, which was troublesome to use in a serverless Brave extension context. We had to patch it to work in chrome-extension:// contexts (since Brave extensions use the same protocol as Chrome extensions). We also had to insert some hacks to make it possible to launch the 'Send Funds' page from a button click with a pre-populated address, since Meteor doesn't allow navigating to an endpoint unless the main app page is already loaded. Figuring out how to bundle geth and the front-end in Brave was also challenging. We didn't want to check any binaries or obfuscated javascript bundles directly into the source tree so we had to figure out ways to download these components at build time.  We had some trouble at the end with launching geth wallet creation as a subprocess and passing in the user's wallet password securely. We also couldn't get ledger nanos to work with testnet. "", ""Above all we're proud to have a wallet that is basically functional and hassle-free to set up. We are especially proud that we were able to create a more secure wallet than existing solutions like wallet.ethereum.org and Mist by applying a content security policy, loading the code in a client-side package (that will eventually be code-signed when it's released as part of Brave browser), and rendering the web app in a sandboxed context that is up-to-date with Chromium. We are also proud that the app doesn't require users to download any command-line tools or understand the inner workings of geth. We hope this will allow users of diverse backgrounds to get started with using secure hardware Ethereum wallets.Finally, as creators and users of Brave, we are super excited that Brave will have a builtin Ethereum wallet, hopefully making secure cryptocurrency management more accessible to folks who are already using Brave. "", 'We learned a lot about packaging geth and running it as a subprocess. We also learned how to write Brave extensions and include HTML files from an NPM package. In the process of coming up with this project, we learned some new things about security weaknesses in existing Ethereum wallets. ', 'We want to improve upon the wallet.ethereum.org UI by updating our fork of it to the latest web3, doing user studies, and figuring out how to make the UI more friendly for newbies. We also would like to build in wallet support for other cryptocurrencies, starting with Zcash. We also need to build in localization for non-English speaking users.

"Voice Assistant for Microsoft Identity Manager ","Voice Assistant for Microsoft Identity Manager that empowers IT Support staff to query MIM for IT Service requests","[10415, 'The Hackathon to use Azure IoT and Serverless functionality was the catalyst for me to build this project. Last year I built a WebApp version that allowed a Service Desk or IT Admin to search for a person and get a report on that uses metadata from Microsoft Identity Manager. The natural extension is therefore to use spoken word to query and have the result spoken back. It also provided me with the impetus to learn how to use and integrate a number of new Azure Services I previously hadn’t used.  ', 'The IoT Device listens for the Wake Word (Lithnet) and takes a spoken query and converts it to text using Azure Cognitive Services, then uses Azure Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS) to identify an Entity (Person) and an Entitlement (e.g. Mailbox, Active Directory). It then queries Microsoft Identity Manager (via Azure API Management and the Lithnet Microsoft Identity Manager REST API Service) to find the queried Entity before finally providing an audio response for the queried entitlement and logging the event into Table Storage and Power BI via Azure IoT Hub. ', 'After architecting a high level conceptual solution, I started investigating the elements of the solution I didn’t have previous exposure too. I started with Cognitive Services and used PowerShell and Invoke-RestMethod to formulate my web requests to integrate with the services and perform the necessary functions. I then designed my custom LUIS Model to take phrases and identify the entity and the entitlement. When I had working solutions for Speech to Text, Text to Speech, and LUIS I translated the necessary initiation piece to Python (Speech to Text) and got it working from my IoT Device. I then configured Azure API Management to front end the Lithnet Microsoft Identity Manager REST API Service. I translated the LUIS and Microsoft Identity Manager (via API Mgmt) queries into a Webhook Azure PowerShell Function. The Azure Function utilises Managed Service Identity and Azure Key Vault for the necessary credentials. Next I converted the Text to Speech PowerShell script to Python to return an audio stream of the query response that is then spoken back to the requester.The final piece was to log each request and response to Azure Table Storage and Power BI via IoT Hub for Auditing and Reporting functions.  ', 'There were many challenges in this project. Some of the more challenging ones that took way longer than I anticipated were;Developing a LUIS Model for the types of queries and intents that I wanted to be recognisedGetting Device to Cloud IoT Messages from the IoT Hub through to Table Storage and Power BI. Lots of reading and lots of failures until a configuration on the Event Hub saw everything fire up.Working with the available memory on the Respeaker Core embedded Linux device and the version of Python offered meant that I had many failed attempts with different Python Libs to be able to send Web Requests to Azure with the differing payloads and authentication methodsAccomplishments I’m proud ofI’m very proud of the entire end-to-end solution. As an experienced Identity Architect I’ve built many Identity Management solutions for customers over the last 20 years. The concept of being able to talk to an Identity Management backend and have it talk back to me still amazes me even though I’ve been working on this for a couple of months. Approaching the crazy concept initially I thought my ability to actually build it was low. After working through a high-level solution and breaking it down into functional components and then working through them individually my confidence grew and I built a working solution.What I learnedBuilding this project exposed me to numerous Azure Services that I hadn’t previously used as well as using some services in different ways. New services I leveraged and got my first exposure to are;Azure Cognitive Services Speech to Text - Used to convert the voice query to text before being submitted to LUISAzure Cognitive Services Text to Speech - Used to take the search query result and convert it to Speech to be spoken back to the requestor Azure Cognitive Services  LUIS – (Language Understanding Intelligent Service) used to identify the entity to query and the entitlement to evaluateAzure Event Hub - Sending IoT Device to Cloud messages through he IoT Hub to Event Hub to Stream Analytics. Azure Stream Analytics - Taking the Device to Cloud Messages and outputting to Table Storage and Power BIAzure Table Storage - Storing events for auditing/reportingAzure API Management - Integration of Lithnet MIM Service REST API Python - This was my first ever use of Python. The Python script on the IoT Device listens for the Wake-Up Word and interfaces with Azure Cognitive Services for Speech to Text and Text to Speech along with the Azure FunctionWhat’s next for the projectThe project is currently essentially read-only. The information that can be retrieved and the pre-requisites to make it available mean that it doesn’t consider context or authorisation. I’d love to implement voice-based authentication into the solution so that the speaker/requestor is identified by their voice pattern (using Azure Cognitive Services Speaker Identification API) and authenticated to Azure Active Directory. Based on the authorisation level of the user higher privileged requests can be initiated. (e.g. Disable User David Bowie, or Create a new user account for Colin Furze). I’d also like to enable the solution using Azure Bot Services. The way the solution has been designed allows for this.

"LightSwipe","Swipe with a thinner wallet, and peace of mind.","[3350, ""The inspiration behind our novelty hack was to eliminate the chip for good. Our prototype device receives transmitted credit card data through flashes of light that represent binary, and stores the data string via photoresistor. From there, it interprets high and low voltages as 1's and 0's and seamlessly saves all of your credit cards in a single device. You can now ditch your wallet, and actually broadcast the encrypted data via an electromagnetic field that we generate through several motor drivers, so you can make purchases at any Point-of-Sales terminal. On top of that, we create an air-tight means of data transmission! The inspiration behind this invention was technology such as Swipe or Square. They encrypt magstripe data into an audio file, but there have been known ways to break this. We thought outside-the-box, and created a way to transmit this sensitive data via LIGHT instead, which is virtually unhackable because there are no scenarios where there can be interceptable packets.   How we built itClaire Li wrote the Android application that communicates the binary light signals, and created the hardware portion of the hack that recieves the magstripe data into the device. We send the photoresistor signals into an analog input pin in an Arduino Uno, then route it to a Raspberry Pi that interprets the information. Ben Roytenberg created the hardware portion of the hack that broadcasts the data to POS-terminals for real purchases, and interpreted the stored magstripe data. He generates the electromagnetic field with this information via stepper motor driver. Challenges we ran intoThis was a very complex hack, and we ran into obstacles across every form of technology we worked with. From the first night, we realized we had to SSH headless into a Raspberry Pi and got stalled with running even the most basic scripts or checking that the photoresistor circuit was even working (it definitely wasn't, and had to be redone three or four times with help). Claire ran into issues with multi-threading and controlling the flash on an Android device to communicate the light data, and getting the photoresistor circuit to work. She had to also find a way to package the information and pass it to Ben's portion of the hardware.

"EDI Connector","Easily integrate EDI invoices into a RPA Accounts Payable (AP) process increasing process accuracy and scalability.","[3819, 'Tangentia Automation consultants were speaking to a large customer in India who were implementing UIPath for their Accounts Payable process and they were receiving invoices from their vendors in multiple formats and their accuracy was only around 60%. Tangentia has a separate business unit called Tangentia EDI that manages EDI for 1000+ companies worldwide. At a water cooler, a Tangentia Automation consultant ran into a Tangentia EDI consultant and they spoke about how they would each approach an Accounts Payable process automation and then we had our eureka moment- why not create an EDI connector from UIPath and that is how we got started on this. The business case: Many companies and many of their vendors already have some EDI infrastructure in place to exchange structured business documents and if we bring those documents within RPA enabled process, we could definitely increase our accuracy within the process as a whole, as well as make the processes easily scalable. ', 'EDI Connector within UIPath takes credentials and dates from the user and returns List of invoices with its details. Within the EDI Connector, the following are the 2 major componentsCommunication:  The EDI connector makes a secure connection with the Tangentia Gateway Cloud EDI Portal and then calls a REST API to fetch EDI information. Currently, it calls Tangentia Gateway, but it can integrate with other EDI applications as well. Additionally, it has been tested with IBM Sterling B2B Integrator.Data Transformation: Converts Raw ANSI-X12 EDI to JSON and makes it available to the UIPath data model. ', 'Our EDI Connector is built using the following steps:First, a code was developed to make a secure connection to the EDI gateway, where the credentials such as username and passwords are authenticated. The session is created with the help of tokens to ensure valid users and correct information is fetched.Second, we wrote a REST API code that fetches invoice headers and their details. This API was called within the DLL to fetch raw JSON data.Third, the fetched JSON data is then deserialized to invoice class and finally, the invoice class is returned as the output to the Uipath activity (returned as data type List).Finally, the DLL developed above is packed in NuGet explorer and imported to Uipath Studio to be used as an Activity. ', ""Converting the EDI file to human readable format was a challenge. Since the output of any EDI gateway is a file of a type *.edi and of a format which is not readable by any user due to its complexity of structure (ANSI-X12), parsing through them is a challenge within UIPath. To overcome this challenge, we developed REST API code that retrieves the invoice data from the database and translates it into UIPath readable data format as described above.What's next for EDI ConnectorTangentia Automation and Tangentia EDI consultants are looking at beta customers for the UIPath EDI Connector and will be looking at expanding the scope of the connector from the existing Accounts Payable (AP) process to cover the entire gamut of Order to Cash and Procure to Pay processes within the enterprise.

The Smart Crops app was created to enable users to visualize crop water needs and yield data.  When a user adds input to factor in the cost of irrigation and the crops value this app can help identify an ideal crop. ', 'This app provides two tools to aid people in finding an ideal crop.   The \'Crop Selection Tool\' allows users to pick a state and compare crops.  After each crop choice the user enters the crop price.  The crops average yield multiplied by this crop price will be used when determining the ideal crop at the end.  When the crops have been selected the user then inputs their irrigation costs.  This info will also be used when determining the ideal crop at the end. The ""Crop Detail Tool\' allows user to visualize detailed crop data for a chosen state.  Yield and water use data are plotted on a bar graph by year.  The user can drill down into this data by clicking on a line in the graph to get all the details available for the crop.  This includes the number of planted acres, irrigated acres, yield per acre, irrigation source (ground or surface), and amount of irrigation used.

"Real Time Lead Detector for Water Supply","Inspired by the Flint Michigan Water Crisis, a cheap and continuous Arduino lead detector that can be accessed online","[5956, 'For two years, the people of Flint, Michigan were unwittingly drinking water contaminated by lead in poisonous concentrations. The residents had no idea that they were drinking water that could and would eventually lead to several serious medical conditions. They had no way of verifying that the dirty and off-smelling water was safe like the government told them.Most current lead testing devices are kits that are single use and need to be sent to a lab, using time and money. Our goal is not only to create an affordable and accurate lead detection system, but to keep a real time graph of lead levels that can be easily accessed from the Internet. Not only is our system for long-term use, there is no hassle of sending it to labs because the readings come at a constant interval. ', 'The carbon paste electrodes (CPE) from the study, “Determination of Pb2+ ions by a modified carbon paste electrode based on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and nanosilica,” detect Pb2+ ions in an aqueous solution. A voltage is created from this interaction. The NodeMCU circuit measures the amount of voltage from the lead (from a potentiometer in these tests) and prints out the voltage amount every 30 seconds. This data is sent to Adafruit IO but also our website, which can be accessed with Internet connection.The voltage is based on the concentration of lead, so theoretically, the amount of voltage measured can be correlated to how much lead is in the water. The NodeMCU detects the voltage and sends it to the Arduino code sensor. This is sent to a live feed at Adafruit *(link below) and can be accessed from the website (in Github).  ', 'We learned about the Arduino and NodeMCU. We connected the NodeMCU to a breadboard, and since the voltage is 3.3V and we need it to be on a scale of 0 to 1V, we added two resistors of 220 ohms and 470 ohms. We connected the 3.3V, the Grounded, and the A0 pins to the circuit. We used a potentiometer to replace the lead detecting electrode. This is to verify that the NodeMCU picks up voltage information, which it does.Then, we created a model website to display this information to the public and to the user of the device. It shows the live feed of voltage. This would be useful when implemented in a pipe, so that the government can consistently check the lead levels. People can also make sure the water supply is clean for their children and safe for consumption. ', 'Our first step was figuring out how to detect lead in water. Through research, it seemed very difficult to find a chemical that reacted with lead safely and in a clear way. Fluorine reacts with lead (but “vigorously”). Chlorine reacts but it is endothermic. We thought about Sodium rhodizonate, which police use to determine bullet residue, and it causes a color change. However, that is not easily detectable by arduinos.Also, we had to figure out how to process that information. Luckily, we took classes on Arduino and The Internet of Things, which gave us the idea to use the NodeMCU with the Arduino coding language.Lastly, we had to figure out how to display it to the users. We created a website using HTML, which I (Sunny) learned for the first time today. Making the graphics and links work took some time, but we overcame the challenge.There was difficulty publishing the code we wrote for the website, even though it works on my computer. So, we included the raw files that can be downloaded onto another computer. ', ""This is my (Sunny's) first Hackathon and Nithya's second. We are a two-girl team that is relatively inexperienced, and in less than 24 hours, we were able to:    -brainstorm ideas     -research properties of lead and methods for detection    -take classes and get ideas (Arduino and Internet of Things)    -learn HTML and website making    -learn about Arduino structure and capabilities    -use Arduino coding language    -modify code in HTML and CSS    -use Adafruit and Arduino for the first time    -make a circuit with resistors, a potentiometer, and NodeMCU, connected by USB "", 'See above :) ', 'The goal location of this product would be for widespread municipal use. Attached to pipes that supply water, the lead water detectors would give a regular update on the lead levels in the water and warn citizens and government officials when the lead amount goes above the healthy amount (15 ppb). Currently, we will start with purchasable, single home detector. We want to expand it to municipal use.Future improvements are making it cheaper and smaller (possibly a ring shape to fit around the faucet). It could also be tweaked to detect other types of contaminants in the water than just lead, and be accessed from phones and receive alerts if lead amount over healthy. We want to actually test with electrodes and lead solution.ImpactNYC school water supply has not been tested in 10 years. There are problems being reported in Newark schools with drinking water. With this new innovation in water monitoring, there is regular testing (can set it to every hour, every day, etc.). There is transparency, because the information will be on the internet and be public domain; government and public will know everything. People can check for public health and safety.The water crisis of Flint Michigan could have been prevented by consistent check of lead concentration in the water supply. Hopefully, this will revolutionize water infrastructure and ensure public health.

Its time to know. Start Using this app now...You can study information on this link below to better understand things about Blood/Glucose Levels ranges in the bodyhttp://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes_care/blood-sugar-level-ranges.htmlConsequently,  The Standard blood Glucose Level set by NICE Experts were illustrated in the table below for both Non-Diabetic, Pre-Diabetics and Diabetic Patients.Diabetes is a serious illness that requires persistence medical approach and patient self-management education to prevent and reduce the risk of long-term diabetes complications.High blood sugar can reduce blood flow and damage the nerves in your feet. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can lead to serious infections. Diabetes can lead to pain,Dental gum infections,weakening of immune systems,double risk of heart diseases, Strokes, tingling or loss of sensation in your feet.Understanding your blood glucose level ranges plays a vital roles in the effective management of diabetes. If someone with diabetes has a Glucose meter, test strips and is testing, it\'s vital to know your blood glucose level. This test may be carried out before or 2 hours after meal.The test can also be carried out before excercise, at bedtime or during fasting.In the United State, blood sugar is normally measured in milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood (mg/dl). A milligram is very little, about 0.00018 of a teaspoon. A deciliter is about 3 1/3 ounces.In  Canada and the United Kingdom, blood sugar level is reported in millimoles/liter (mmol/L). You can convert Canadian or British glucose levels to American numbers by multiplying the obtained values in (mmol/L) by factor of  18.If someone from Britain, Canada reports that their fasting blood glucose was (6mmol/L), you can multiply that by 18 and get their U.S. glucose level of 108 mg/dl.Diabetic Patients and their respective caregivers must also use pen and a log-book to record their glucose level on daily basis and then brings it in the next follow-up medical appointments in order for the Doctor/Physician to decide on what could be the next line of actionin fighting the diabetes chronic diseases.This is what the apps Does:Glucose Level Check (is a free web, mobile-web and Android apps) that help you monitor and record your Sugar/Glucose Level anytime anywhere.This app enable Diabetic Patients to easily share their data securely and privately with Diabetes Treatment teams,Doctors over SMS,Emails etc. in order to help you and your doctor see how your treatment is working and to know possibly what could be the next treatment options.

"Ovulation &amp; Menstral Cycle(A Multi-Billion Dollar App)","Monitor and Record your Ovulation and Fertility Cycle in Real-Time.","[6996, 'They have been series of family issues here and there regarding some men being aggressive with their wives, life partners saying that their partner cannot get pregnant despite being medical fit,Some argued that they need either Male or Female Child. However, most times it may be that they are having Sex when the woman is not in her Fertility Period. Millions of Women does not even know when they will be expecting theirPeriods, Ovulations or even Pregrenancy to better plan her sex time period or perhaps for family planning...Understanding your Ovulation & Menstral Cycle plays a vital roles in the effective management of your womenhood System for either becoming Pregnant or avoid it.Ovulation and Menstral Cycle are intercalated in nature. Ovulation? is the release of eggs(ovules) from the female Ovaries. This eggs are available to be fertilized by sperm cell.It a mid-point of menstral Cycle.What the App DoesThis app will enable Users(women)to  monitor and record her Ovulation Cycle/Periods, Knows her next Menstral Period, Her Fertility Period which increases herchances of getting Pregnant or avoiding it which can be tracked on the App History & Calendaring System.it tell the User the actual day She will give birth if She concieve.Consequently, If women has sex before 6 days or more before She Ovulates, the possibility that She will get pregnant is uncertain and absolutely tends to zero.The app also tell you the actual day your egg or ovule is available to be fertilized by Sperm cells. The app will tellyou the actual day that you can have sex so that you can have either a boy or a girl by usingDr. Shettles Mathematical Formula. Shettles discovery indicates, men produce two types of sperms, the X (female) and Y (male). Dr. Shettles\' studies suggests the y-sperms are smaller, weaker, but faster than their siblings x-sperms, which are bigger, stronger, but slower.Consequently, According to Dr. Shettles, there are other options in getting either a Male or a Female Child and they includes1.) PH value of Women Varginal Tract.A more acidic varginal tracts favors girls, since it will kill the weaker y-sperms first, leaving a greater quantity of x-sperms available to fertilize the egg. Consequently, a more alkaline environment favors boys.Shettles recommends a douche of water and vinegar (acid) immediately before intercourse to favor a girl; a douche of water and baking soda (alkaline) will help for a boy.Very mportant: Some women are naturally very acidic and may have serious issues producing boys because acidic medium kills  Y-Sperms easily.2.)PH of Women\'s orgasms.PH is a measure of Alkalinity or Acidity of a medium.  Orgasms mostly occurred when sex is at climax with a partner and the woman is sexually stimulated.When a woman has an orgasm, the body releases some milky fluid substance that makes the environment more alkaline, favoring boys. consequently no orgasms will favour girls!.The book titled ""The Case of the Female Orgasm: Bias in the Science of Evolution by Elisabeth Lloyd, Ph.D., a biology professor at Indiana Universitysuggest that to have Orgasm, ""Sex Partners needs to relax to build sexual tension.""The best preparation for a big orgasm is probably a long, steamy shower, full-body massages by and for your man or 10 minutes of steady oral sex, if you can get it. 3.)Sexual Positioning & PenetrationPositioning during sex and depth of penetration are also affected by PH. Towards entrance to the vagina, women tract is too acidic and thus shallow penetration will favour X-Sperm producing girls. consequently,deep penetration will favour Y-Sperm producing boys because the Sperm are closer to the egg for fertilization.All this Information can be Tracked also from the app History Menu and by Navigating The Menstral Calendering System using Calenders ""Next and Previous"" buttonThe app will periodically and automatically update the women via SMS components on her next Menstral Period, Ovulation Time, Fertility Time, Non-Pregnancy time ,Male or Female Child conceiving time and Child Birthrate if She conceives all in real-time.Platform of AvailabilityAndroid, Web & Mobile Web.Apps Screenshots Scenario and UseabilityThe Screenshot below show the Apps Landing PageThe Screenshot Below show Users making registrations from within the appThe Screenshot Below show Users  Uploading His Profile Pictures,br>The Screenshot Below show Users entering her Menstral Cycle Data for Analysis/5.png)The Screenshot Below show Users show Users Menstral historical Data Over time..The Screenshot Below show Users Menstral Calendaring SystemHow to test the Demo....I Just created one account but you can create as many as possibleUsername: testpassword: testFirst Signup within the app either from the Mobile web or from the android version.

Sure the technology exists but it stumped us as to why we hadn\'t seen anyone doing what we aim to do.  Due to time constraints with such a huge vision, we focused on three points in the Student Union for this weekend. The first feature we thought would have a big impact on the student body is automating the textbook system. The vision is, iBeacons are placed at the front of the Bookstore. UAccess is fully integrated   is the main hub for students and textbooks there When a student walks by, they are picked up by the beacon and are sent a notification that asks if they\'d like to reserve their textbooks. Their textbook lists are then accessed and pulled from the UAccess database and   The students then select the textbooks he/she wants and that is then sent downstairs via a request on internal computers to begin the process of pulling the books. The user is sent a time as to how long it will take (calculated based on how many reservations) and they can then use the indoor mapping system to locate supplies or apparel they may need which can help cut the time and keep it as consistent as possible. The second space we planned for was the good ol\' classroom. The student walks through a beacon outfitted class and is checked in for their attendance. The professor can then check the attendance to double check, just in case someone does not have a smartphone. The app, now being recognized as in a classroom, shifts to 3 options. Attendance, an app wide UAccess tab, and now a clicker integrated into it. No need to spend $100 on a dinky clicker!!!! If a student who is not registered for that class walks in, they will receive a notification they are in the wrong room and have the option of being routed in the case of them getting lost. The teacher is also notified of the student for safety purposes as well as academic integrity purposes. The third is an option for a map that will be on every ""live-page"" What I mean by this is since the beacons have amazing accuracy, when you are near Mckale Center the U of A app will have its app wide features as well as some that are only available by Mckale. This includes taking the classes option, moving it to a non central-focused space and replace it with a news and tickets interface. The map is the main hub for this school and this experience.

"""Teach me Tables"" - an Alexa Skill","""Teach me Tables"" helps kids learn and memorize math tables in a new, interactive, visually appealing and fun way.","[4190, 'As I live in New Jersey but work in New York, I get very little time to teach my kids at home.On one Saturday morning, I tried to teach math tables to my 6 year old. It was difficult. After different trials and errors, I found a way to keep her engaged and entertaining. I told her that we were going to play a game.First, I would draw the first 5 items from two table in big bold letters on a blackboard and challenged her to remember as many as she can. Once she is ready, I would wipe those out, and quiz her the first half of the 2 times table. I am surprised to see her learning quickly. Gamification of teaching tables this way made engaged and entertaining. So, from then on, every Saturday, we would play this game. She not only enjoys this mode of learning but started learning tables quickly. So, I thought of spreading this method to all other parents like me because it is very effective.  I thought the best way to do this is to automate this process so that all other kids can use it in a fun way.After exploring, I found Alexa Presentation Language (APL) with which we can create beautiful, immersive experiences by building an Alexa skill that runs on every device such as Echo, Echo Show, Fire TV, etc.My daughter loves this Alexa skill I have built, and she loves to play it over and over again on our Smart TV (using Amazon Fire stick) and she now knows tables all the way up to 8th table perfectly and she is just in the First Grade :)  ', '""Teach me Tables"" is an Alexa Skill that helps kids learn and memorize math tables in an interactive, visually appealing and fun way. It starts out by asking which table kids like to learn. It then displays and recites the first five items from that table. It will ask the user to memorize them and once they are ready, it tests their memory with a short quiz. It congratulates kids using funny voices when they get it right, and when they get it wrong, it makes funny sounds and tells them the correct answer.For every correct answer, it assigns 10 points and the score is tracked throughout the session to keep kids engaged. Once the first half of the table is completed, it then goes on to teach  the rest of the table using similar techniques. This skill is developed based on a real life, proven teaching techniques used to teach kids master their math times tables. ', 'The skill is built using Node.js, Alexa Skills Kit (ASK), Alexa Presentation Language (APL), Visual Studio Code, Lambda, Git and AWS.APL is very fun to play with.

"mARk","Leave your mark on the world. ","[6797, ""We've all gone hiking and seen geotagging. We've all seen PokemonGo come and leave, disrupting our lives in ways we didn't see coming. We believe that AR's purpose is to merge reality with the digital world, and we feel that creativity is essential to utilizing AR in the best way possible. That's why we decided to create mARk, an app where you can make AR Art Pieces (or ARt as we like to call it) and share them with the world. "", ""mark allows users to experience art pieces based on their current location. The app loads different marks based on the users location, and lets users see the unique pieces in their area. Through simple motions, the users are able to place spherical nodes anywhere in the world, and send these nodes to be shared with the world forever.How it's builtBuilt entirely with Apple's AR Kit and Google's Firebase, this project utilizes ARKit with SceneKit to render the environment. Marks are sent from our application to the database with the press of a button.We used Swift, AR Kit, and Google's FirebaseChallenges we ran intoOriginally at the start of the hackathon, our team was set on creating an AR app using the Unity platform. We attempted to use technologies on Unity such as Vuforia and Mapbox in order to create an AR camera and to keep track of location. However, after 15 hours of hard work and setting up almost every component of the project including database set up and UI, we failed to make progress towards to the core idea of our project - the ability to stick marks to a geographic location. As a result, we scrapped what we had done on Unity and decided to just use Swift to perform what we needed instead. After making the decision to switch to Swift, we encountered many other challenges as well. One main issue was figuring out how we wanted to store our data. In our application, marks were sets of 3D colored spheres which were too large to store into a database. Therefore, we had to spend a long time making design decisions, because we wanted to keep efficiency and scalability in mind to make it easy to scale the product. For example, some troubling decisions included deciding what properties to store for each mark the user creates and within each mark, how the structure of the data should look.Another big challenge was that the hackathon room itself had no GPS signal. This made testing difficult, since one of the main features we wanted to implement was how a user could only see a mark if the mark is near them. In addition to frequently going outside of the main room to perform tests, we also had to figure out a way such that marks are presented locally so that it is demoable.Unity gave us a hard time before we had to switch to SwiftAccomplishments that we're proud ofWe're proud of the fact that despite the number of difficulties that we ran into, we didn't give up. We realized that the idea was borderline impossible for us to finish in time with Unity by Saturday evening. Despite the limited time remaining, instead of calling it quits, we completely switched technologies and started on a new application. Two hours later, Ronak managed to put together a prototype despite having no previous experience with AR Kit. We all hopped onto the application and continued from there.What we learnedWe all learned new technologies. Most of us hadn't worked with augmented reality prior to this hackathon. For those that did, we still treaded with new ground as we went through and implemented augmented reality with three different technologies. Even though we failed with Unity, we all learned quite a lot in order to get a basic application running. Once we switched over to using Xcode, most of us also learned to use Swift for the first time.We also learned the importance of hacking until the very end. We ran through countless errors with Unity and design problems with Swift. It didn't change the fact that we kept pushing through the process and continued to code.What's next for markWe plan to submit to the app store, fingers crossed it'll be approved within the week.We also have a plan to monetize the app, modeled heavily after Snapchat's Model. By default, all graffiti will only be shared with your friends (which can be manually added through the app). However, companies can sponsor in app landmarks to appear in certain locations, where we can thus charge them based on time. They can import any sort of 3D STL file to give them more options.Additionally, any user using the app can share their graffiti with the whole world (for that location) for the following prices$0.99 -> Public, Accessible for a Week$1.99 -> Public, Accessible for a Month$9.99 -> Public, Accessible for a YearWe're excited by this product, and are interested to see where it goes!Built WitharkitswiftTry it outmarkshare.techgithub.com      Submitted to    HackUCI 2019Winner                Most Polished Devpost Submission                  Created by  I came up with the idea for the application and developed parts of it on Unity using technologies such as Vuforia and Mapbox.

When we moved our project from Unity to Swift, I helped Daniel with basic geolocation and color integration, as well as modifying the Firebase database to store more relevant information about the marks. Overall, I learned a lot about iOS app development and had an amazing time!Yiming ZhaoI worked on setting up the algorithm for spawning specific marks based on a location's longitude & latitude.

"Plugin generator from Atlassian Connect to JIRA Server","plugin, add-on, generator, jira server, jira cloud, atlassian connect","[4699, 'The Atlassian Connect framework greatly simplifies and unifies developing add-ons for JIRA Cloud. Unfortunately, plugins for JIRA Server still requires a considerably large amount of inconsistent boilerplate source code on both front-end and back-end sides. This is currently an obstruction in maintaining equal supports for both JIRA Cloud add-ons and JIRA Server plugins, let alone delivering the same user experience on both JIRA environments. We believe that the problem can be solved elegantly if JIRA Server plugins can be generated automatically from their JIRA Cloud counterpart. ', ""This plugin generates a JIRA Server plugin from a provided Atlassian Connect add-on's descriptor and other information including package name and artifact name. The newly generated plugin will communicate with the remote server just the same way as the Atlassian Connect add-on, and will provide the same JavaScript and REST API facilities in order to minimize the amount of adjustment on the remote server's source code.How to use itWe knew about this hackathon three weeks ago, and did not make enough time to register our plugins to Atlassian Marketplace. We provide several alternative ways for you to try out this plugin:JIRA Server plugin:https://github.com/minhhai2209/jira-plugin-generator/blob/master/jira-generator-server-plugin-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar?raw=trueOr you can just go right here and generate your plugin:http://jira-plugin-generator.tk/generateSample Atlassian Connect add-on for you to try the generator:http://jira-plugin-generator.tk:8080/hw/jsonNoticeWe include a request parameter pp (plugin path, that is <group_id>-<artifact_id>) in all callback URL. The base URL for all requests became xdm_e + cp + pp. Hence,Atlassian Connect add-on REST's base URL https://company.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/<resource> becomes https://company.com/plugins/servlet/plugin_path/rest-proxy/rest/api/2/<resource>.Atlassian Connect add-on JavaScript URL https://company.atlassian.net/atlassian-connect/all.js becomes https://company.com/plugin_path/all.js.LimitationsFor web fragments, we only support Web Item, Web Panel, Web Section, Admin Page, and General Page. Context parameters are supported for Web Item. The JWT information is send to the remote server upon installation, but we haven't used it for REST API authentication. "", ""We follow the same approach as Atlassian Connect framework, that is, showing plugin's contents inside iframes. This project consists of two components - a plugin template, and a generator.The generator simply inserts into the JIRA Server plugin's descriptor locations of web fragments declared in Atlassian Connect add-on descriptor. It also replace various placeholders with real information, like artifact ID and package name for Java source code.For plugin template, the descriptor contains the declaration of all web fragments. When a web fragment being displayed, the renderers consult information provided in the Atlassian Connect add-on's descriptor to inject the corresponding iframe. We leverage Atlassian Connect's JavaScript to provide the same API for communication between the iframe and the host UI, so that developers do not have to update their client-side logic. The plugin template also provide a servlet that forward REST API calls to /rest/api/2 endpoint. This servlet act as a proxy that authenticates the requests using JWT token, and authenticate itself with Java using a JIRA administrator account. "", 'We had to study the underlying design of Atlassian Connect framework. We also have to master the JIRA Server plugin framework to provide as much as possible the facilities that Atlassian Connect provides for developers. ', 'We are happy to see that the idea works. At our company, we had built two add-ons for JIRA Cloud, and will have to build more. This plugin generator will significantly reduce our efforts and seamlessly provide the same user experience for both JIRA environments.

"FireNode - Wardriving as a Service","A real time localization platform that provides high resolution population density maps of network infrastructures","[5902, 'The idea for our hack came to us as we decided where we were going to set up for the weekend during the hackathon. As we searched crowded rooms across north campus, we knew there had to be a way to get real time updates about how many people are on campus and where they are studying. From this, FireNode was born.  ', ""FireNode is a real time interior localization platform designed to provide high resolution population density maps of large network infrastructures. FireNode is a learning algorithm utilizing big data concepts - as more wifi hotspot data is collected, FireNode's knowledge of the network and hotspot locations expands to reflect more accurate user densities. Our service has three main components; data acquisition, analytics, and presentation. The data acquisition is carried out by a mobile app that reads GPS and wireless network information. This information is sent to a server where data analytics are performed using custom algorithms. Our algorithms determine the location of wifi hotspots through trilateration (similar to triangulation) and determine the number of people connected to a given hotspot. From there, the analytics data is sent to be presented to the user as a map overlaid with relative population density with a resolution down to individual rooms.     "", 'We built a mobile Android app to continuously monitor network and GPS information in the background of the Android operating system. The app scans all available wireless hotspots every 5 seconds to retrieve access point IP addresses, MAC addresses and RSSI/frequency. The RSSI (signal strength) and frequency allows us to calculate  distance from the phone to a wireless hotspot. In addition, we monitor GPS location changes to pair network hotspots with a Latitude/Longitude coordinate. We use Firebase as our data management service, sending the real time data outlined above to the Linode Server. This Linode server hosts our java server, which analyzes and processes over a hundred wifi/gps combinations a second to identify the exact location of scanned wifi hotspots. We accomplish this by using a process called trilateration. Each non-linear trilateration calculation use all of the previous data points for a given hotspot, and custom calculations to compensate for the spherical coordinates of the earth. Finally, we have a node server running on our Linode host to gather IP connection information from the network. This node server contains an ARP table which allows us to look at all connected devices on the University campus and aggregate IP addresses. Once we have all available IP addresses, we can figure out how many connections each wireless hotspot has and link it to the location data collected before. ', 'There were a couple difficult algorithms that we had to write, involving some difficult mathematics to figure out.  Trilateration functionality on the java server was a difficult algorithm to implement. To get an accurate location out of the trilateration algorithm, we had to figure out how to convert latitude and longitude GPS coordinates to useable distances in a pseudo-cartesian coordinate system. For the mobile app, getting the distance between the user and the wifi router proved to be a challenge. We had to manually calculate the distance using the strength and frequency of the connected wifi signal. In terms of networking, matching BSSIDs to IP addresses in order to find unique connections over the entire network was a big task, given the massive size of the network. It required a lot parsing ARP information and finding suitable _ insights _  from that data. ', 'We are proud of our ability to overcome all of the challenges that we ran into while developing FireNode, ranging from the difficult mathematics of trilateration to parsing the massive amount of data about the network. We are also proud of the low latency time between collecting our data and displaying it to the user, i.e. making our application truly real-time. ', ""Dominik learned Python.Sean learned about the Android framework.Michael learned about networking via the Android OS.Dominik taught Antonio that Python has a continue keyword...We still haven't learned what the TBD prize was...? "", 'FireNode can now be expanded in countless ways. As our database grows, we can incorporate machine learning for predictive technologies. FireNode aggregates a lot of data about population density and traffic on a room by room resolution, which could be useful to both students and the school. Students who are looking for a place to study or an uncrowded room to work in would easily be able to see in real time which rooms would be the best to work at any given time. Schools on the other hand could use the data over a period of time to gauge and better understand what areas of buildings are used the most, have the highest traffic, and what areas of the building may need more Wifi access points. What is really exciting is that FireNode can be applied anywhere with a large network infrastructure, like corporate campuses, malls, or high traffic areas.

"EmergencyChain","Decentralized first responder network and secure emergency medical data delivery system","[4525, ""It's hard to find legitimate use cases for blockchain technology "", ""This system is designed to address two problems:Often (especially in rural and developing regions) emergency medical services like 911 simply can't arrive in time. When a sudden emergency occurs, fast help is often the difference between life and death.When 911 does arrive, they don't have very much information about you. Your medications, allergies, conditions, emergency contacts – information that could help them save your life, but isn't often available.To address these issues, we propose a permissioned blockchain network designed to connect individuals with confirmed first responder training\xa0(EMTs, doctors, nurses, ...) who happen to be extremely nearby when an emergency situation occurs. Many of these responders will be willing to be notified even in the middle of the night if they could save a life in jeopardy if they're only 10 blocks away.The system will additionally support the delivery of emergency medical data, curated (and optionally stored) by potential patients themselves to both official emergency services and the nearby first responders (once they have published a transaction stating that they are nearby and en route to help). "", ""The ethereum-based, private network is secured by validator nodes run by hospitals, physicians, EMSs, fire departments, etc: organizations we know have a vested interest in preserving human life (even the pessimistic must agree they are incentivized because they rely on living humans for revenue). They validate transactions, approve new validators, and authorize first responders.We use IoT devices (phone accelerometers/gyroscopes, wearables, etc) to detect potential emergencies and send a notification asking the recipient to confirm they are OK. If they don't, we immediately contact the closest official emergency responder service (911) and additionally launch a transaction on the blockchain. This component – the accident detection service – can either be run on a private cloud server paid for by the potential patient or run by a validator node or external third party as a SaaS.Once an emergency is in process, first responders will be notified via a mobile app (either through a push notification sent by the validator who authorized the first responder to join the network, or by running a custom mobile light client) if the emergency is within their configured range. They can choose to respond, which involves publishing their location, intent, public key, and optional contact data. Once a responder is confirmed, the patient's emergency medical data will be encrypted with the responders public key by the accident detection service and delivered to the responder as they approach the patient. "", 'Scope creep was a big one. It was hard not to try to build everything and then some. This was an extremely interesting use case to develop and we hope people who see its value will reach out to us to discuss it further.Also our front-end guys took this opportunity to learn react-native for the first time (great job X!) ', 'We believe this is both a legitimate use of blockchain technology (as the centralized version of this service would be hugely invasive for both patients and responders, and would present and extremely high-value target for malicious actors) and a good example of a use case that can only succeed on a permissioned chain as the geo-coordinates of an incapacitated victim could be easily exploited by malicious individuals for their own morbid gain if they were published on a publicly-accessible network. ', ""First and foremost: The ethereum community really needs some robust light clients.Also, discussion of this use case really convinced us that easily-managed-by-grandma private cloud server applications need to exist, and need to be easy to create.

"Relations for JIRA","Introducing companies and contacts to JIRA","[9262, ' ', ' ', ""We started building this add-on because some of our colleagues had a serious need to manage their relations in JIRA. After some research, we noticed that many people were looking for some sort of CRM functionality in JIRA. We weren't sure what people were looking for exactly though... This is why we built an MVP Server version of Relations and shipped it internally and to a dozen customers for feedback. And boy, we learned a lot from that! The #1 feedback we got is that people definitely needed this add-on.Even though we were using Server ourselves, like most of our clients, we decided to focus our efforts on JIRA Cloud at first. Why? Because we realized that the challenges for the Cloud version were an order of magnitude more complex, that decisions would be harder and that the technology would likely slow us down. But going through this tougher road would ultimately help us later when going back to Server and it would allow us to reach way more users right from the start.Looking back, we're glad we went down this road. It's not that we have an exciting feature list, but we know that we have a very strong core and that what we have, we can build on.We chose technology that would allows us to build on an amazing stack, but also port as much code as possible back to the Server version. All of the front-end code is therefore written in ClojureScript. The backend is written in Clojure with a strong dependency on the Datomic transactor. For the Server version we will match that with a triple/quad store implementation of a Sesame RDF store that will use Active Objects for storage. But that's enough buzzword-bingo. "", ""The first challenge we took on was to write our own Connect framework implementation in Clojure. We kind of reverse engineered the existing Java and NodeJs frameworks into a Clojure version. We are glad we did this for the full control it gives us for that part.Another big challenge, that is completely unrelated to technology, is the place where the data lives. Suddenly the data does not live inside a customer's JIRA, but we are responsible for it. We must do the best we can to make Relations for JIRA a safe place for our customer's data. Legislation from all around the world will play a big role in this, as we are storing sensitive and personal data.Other challenges include the limitations the Connect framework imposes on our work.

Why can't we just let everyone have access to the speakers?What It DoesAux allows a host user to login into their Spotify account and create an empty playlist, identified by a pin that can be shared with other listeners. After someone has the playlist pin or 'Aux code', they can access the request system for that playlist. The request system queries Spotify's library and allows the requested songs to be voted upon. Every few minutes, the top requested song is queued into the party playlist.How We Built ItWe built Aux using Spotify's API and a Flask server.Challenges We Ran IntoThe Python API wrapper we used, Spotipy, made it difficult to get authorization for the host account in an elegant way.AccomplishmentsWe accomplished so much this weekend: running a server locally, accessing and generating a user playlist, and implementing a live voting and priority queue system.What We LearnedOur group has learned a lot about front and back-end development, specifically experimenting with JS, Angular.js (although unsuccessful), and Flask.

"Airena","A game where you write &amp; edit AI code on the fly to fight in the arena!","[5537, 'I\'ve always loved the idea of writing an AI bot to challenge or fight others. I think it\'s a super fun way to learn to program and feels empowering. I always wanted to host a ""St. Olaf vs Carleton Bot Wars"" sort of thing, but none of the available tools really make it easy. That\'s mainly because:You can\'t challenge individual people or groups. You can only upload your code to fight in the global leaderboards.You can\'t easily play the game as a human, or play against your own bot as a human player.Most games are grid-based. (Which is ideal for developing AI, but is often not what the real world looks/feels like)So I set out to make something that should be: simple, flexible and tangible. I wanted something that does not obscure the process of writing code. No one writes a perfect algorithm from scratch on their first try. Programming is an iterative process. It\'s very important for beginners to see that to understand how talented programmers do what they do and how they got to where they are. * My tool will be highlighting, rather than obscuring, the process of writing code.* ', ""Airena (pronounced Eye-reen-a) is a multiplayer game, a teaching tool and a (prototype of a) platform. It's a space shooter that you can play as a human. You can immediately click on the code button to write up your bot and watch it take over. Joining the game is as easy as opening the link. "", ""I used CreateJS for manipulating the canvas and vector graphics. I used CodeMirror for the in-browser code editor. I'm using NodeJS with Socket.io for the networking. The game runs the Javascript code you supply it in an isolated container so you can't interfere with the game itself. All you can do is return which key to press next. You have access to some data about the world, such as your position and the positions of other players.  "", 'Not having really done a proper multiplayer/networking game before definitely made it a challenge to figure out how to connect and sync multiple users across the world. It was even more challenging to figure out how to allow anyone to run their own AI bot on the fly. I also spent a lot of time thinking about a game that would be simple enough to implement but still provide enough interesting challenge/strategy to be played by humans and AI. ', ""This is definitely the easiest and fastest way to write code for an AI bot and see immediate results (all within a browser!)Variables and state information persist even though the code gets recompiled at every keystroke!The server keeps track of every player's code and state in its own isolated container, separate from the global state.The live-coding-server logic is more or less decoupled, making it easy to repurpose for any other game or simulation for teaching purposes. (Imagine it being as easy as: import the plugin, define which function you want users you to be able to live-edit, and a code button pops up that allows users to play with the code in real time!)Despite how simple this game is, this would actually be pretty close to a real setting where you might implement AI because of the game state is continuous (not grid based). If we wanted to teach people about techniques such localization, we could omit sending the current player's position and have them use the common techniques to locate themselves on the map. "", ""I learned a lot about writing networked code, and thinking about decisions such as what logic goes on the server and what can be kept on the client. I also learned about how Javascript can be executed as a separate process within Nodejs (using the VM built in library) and about all the different ways of capturing and isolating an environment. (I'm currently taking a Programming Languages class so it felt highly relevant here!) I had also never used CreateJS before. I could have used Phaser, which is a library specifically built for games, and it probably would have been a lot easier, but I decided to use CreateJS because I hadn't used it before and because it's built to be more general (to support any rich interactive content on the web, not just games) I thought it would be a good tool to know.  "", 'I want to do two main things:One is to further develop the game to make it more fun and interested to write AI for. One thing I\'d love to add is the ability to release ""minions"", so you\'re no longer able to play very effectively as a single human. Then you can feel/see the power of programming. Perhaps a way to store and share code snippets that do various kinds of behaviors.The other is to clean up and publish the live coding server as a standalone, to encourage more people to experiment with this idea, because I very much believe in learning by doing, I think by making it easy to implement this we could improve learning materials and show more people how fulfilling and exciting writing code really is!Source: https://github.com/OmarShehata/Airena ']","['node.js', 'socket.io', 'create.js']","True","27","['omarshe7ta']","https://firefly-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/usercontent/fill/242/161/cGhvdG9zL3Byb2R1Y3Rpb24vc29mdHdhcmVfdGh1bWJuYWlsX3Bob3Rvcy8wMDAvMzczLzExMC9kYXRhcy9vcmlnaW5hbC5naWY=/airena_killer.gif?signature=283462d73af5533bb7161fb4930ac33d48f19918","False","2"

"Work Safety Management (WSM)","...safety monitoring just got efficient","[5816, 'During our internship at a utility industry, we build software that supports many fields workers. These are folks whose work may include performing inspections and repairs in potentially hazardous environments. Most of the software we’ve been developing aids these folks from a productivity standpoint by improving how they perform their work.However, we’ve noticed that nothing really supports them from a safety perspective. They are required to take safety-training courses and acquire certifications, which are useful, but as a team, we started thinking about how could software be used to improve worker safety.  We noticed that sometimes field workers working in hazardous conditions are not able to focus on safety while they are working on their assigned work. For example, a construction worker working near a Gas Pipeline may not able to sense minor gas leaks as he/she is focused on their assigned task. This can cause loss of life and property.Work Safety Management System is our attempt at addressing this problem. ', ""This IoT System contains an Arduino based IoT device which can be connected to worker's helmet, this device senses the Temperature, Pressure, Humidity, Heart Rate, Gas Concentration around the worker and sends it to Azure IoT hub.An Azure Function App gets a trigger via Event Hub whenever there is a new reading available at the IoT Hub. That function stores the reading in the Azure SQL Database and if the readings are above the Threshold levels ( threshold levels are stored in the database and can be configured by Administrators) then the Function App sends a Cloud-to-Device alert message to the device to inform the workers to move to a safe area.A WebApp (hosted on Azure App Service) allows the managers/supervisors to log-in and see their team's status on a Dashboard in a Web Browser. If the managers/supervisors want to send an alert message manually then they can do so by just a click of a button.In this device prototype, we are getting real values for Temperature, Humidity & Pressure from the on board sensors and we are simulating the Hear Rate, GeoLocation and Gas Concentration readings in code. "", ""IoT Device:We are using MXChip IoT DevKit (AZ3166) as the device. The source code for this Arduino based development board is written in C/C++. It has many sensors embedded on the board, so we didn't have to solder the sensors manually and we were able to focus more on the functionality.Web App, API, Database & Function App:*The Web App & API are built using (C#) ASP.NET Core to handle the business logic on the server side. *We used C# for developing Functions on Azure Function App. *We are using JavaScript to get data from the API to the Dashboard and also to handle several client-side components, including the Maps (using Azure Maps), Alert, etc.*We also used Power BI for showing the historical status graph on the dashboard. Power BI really helped us to speed up the dashboard development process, as it allows us to design professional looking graphs very quickly.We are using Azure SQL Database for storing all the application data. "", 'There were several challenges involved in getting the front end components working properly with the back end API, particularly using the Azure Maps, as custom javascript and CSS had to be written to get the functionality we wanted.Initially, we were facing issues making the IoT DevKit send telemetry data to IoT Hub. Later we found out that the issue was because of a bug in the older version of IoT Workbench Extention for Visual Studio Code. Updating that extension to the latest version Fixed that issue.We also faced some challenges while making the Function App trigger automatically when the device sends the readings to IoT Hub. ', 'We are most proud of how far the project has come in such a short development time span. As we came to know about this Hackathon just 4 weeks before the deadline. Over the course of development, we thought of many great ideas that we would like to add to the application but were unable to implement due to time constraints. However, despite this, we have built out all of the core functionality and UI to serve a strong foundation going forward. ', 'Since this project uses many third party tools we learned a lot by working on this project, including how to use Azure Function App with automatic triggering with IoT Hub, Azure Maps, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, and using VS Code for Arduino development. ', 'We will continue to work on the project to expand and improve upon it. The current project will serve as a strong foundation. Going forward, we would like to support different type of devices, as well as to provide access control on the dashboard to support employees of different levels. We are already doing research on how we can use Machine Learning to predict the unsafe work conditions before they become severe.

"Smart Fridge","A Smart Fridge that uses Computer Vision to log in food, keeps user updated by SMS, and provide recommendations. ","[5242, ""We saw the brand new Samsung Family Hub smart fridge at the CES 2017, which require manual data log-in for the goods stored inside. We got inspired to create a smart fridge that can automatically log in what's inside the fridge, enable users to access the data remotely and have information recommended for the users based on what they have in the fridge. "", ""This is an IoT-based smart fridge that uses Computer Vision to automatically log in food, informs the users through text messages of what's stored inside and expiration data, and recommend healthier and better use of user's’ current storage through features like checking nutrition and search for recipes related to some items.  "", 'We used a button on an Arduino board to emulate the action of “closing the fridge door”. The signal created by the button is sent to a PC through a serial COM port. When PC receives that signal, the kinect camera is triggered to capture a photo of the current status in the fridge. The photo is then compressed and sent to our web server. Our web server is coded on Python+Flask and deployed on Google App Engine Flexible Environment. This web server also contains some logics for responding to Twilio messages, which will be mentioned later. When the web server receives that photo, it puts the photo in Google Cloud Storage. It also keeps some basic image metadata in Google Cloud Datastore database. Then the Google Cloud Vision API is called to analyze the photo and label it by what the item is and which category it belongs to. The labels (coming out of cloud vision api) are then passed to Google KnowledgeGraph API to be further narrowed down to things people would normally put in a fridge. The results coming out of Google KnowledgeGraph are then stored in Google Cloud Datastore database. Now the fridge basically identifies the items that were put in it by automatically capturing and analyzing photos. Every time new items are added to the fridge, Twilio would send a notification through SMS to inform userUsers are also able to text Twilio some basic commands to:Check what is currently in the fridgeCheck which item is about to pass its expiration dateCheck the nutrition of the food storedSearch for recipes related to some items ', '1) Capture the kinect photo with the least noise and incorporated Arduino-based trigger for the photo 2) Integrate the local image capture, python web server, google cloud platform, and twilio together and make them work flawlessly. Specifically, the challenges include the following:Image format conversionImage compression and processingHandling HTTP POST/GET requests between Local and web servers for images as well as web servers and twilio for sending and receiving textsCreate appropriate database structure to store images and item labels3) At first, it was really hard to pick the right label from about 10 labels returned by cloud vision api. We used KnowledgeGraph first to narraw the list down to 3-5 labels, and then manually process them according to how “general” or “specific” they are.4) There were some misleading parts in the documentation of cloud vision api in Python. The URI stated in the doc is not the correct format required by the actual function. We finally figured it out by looking into the C# version of that documentation.

"Closed Captions Extension for Twitch Streams","Accessibility for viewers, closed captions for viewers with difficulty or impossibility of hearing.","[2432, 'The idea came thanks to a Twitch Streamer, Snugibun, who started the whole movement for getting captions available for everyone on twitch, but, while the intention was great, I noticed two main problems:  1 - The captions were burned in the video, which meant that getting the original video would be impossible, while re-captioning a video is pretty doable.  2 - Due to them being burned in the stream, they could not be enlarged or moved by the user and also lacked any form of transparency.So I decided to try and find a solution for these problems. ', 'The objective of the project is to allow streamers to add accurate Close Captioning to their streams without much hassle, and without burning the captions on the stream, and also give viewers the option to customize the font size and be able to pop them up as they wish. ', ""The first matter to be decided what framework I was going to use, the decision was not hard, I picked Ruby on Rails for two main reasons: I already have plenty of experience working with it, and it's also the framework in which I am also hosting my other Twitch Extension. Once that was done, I needed to decide what I would do to handle the speech recognition, while many services offer Speech to Text, most of them are meant for recognition of text from recordings, not a stream of audio, so I went with the Web Speech API, which allowed real time STT conversion, which I could later send to the RoR server for re-distribution to all other connected clients, and therefore all clients would receive the same content, in real time.What I learnedDuring the process of making this extension, I learned a lot about both the client and server side of WebSockets and about the Web Speech API, which I found rather interesting.
