While his initial idea, a real time particle-based fluid simulation that could be manipulated using the kit, fell through when we realized that it would take a lot more learning than we could do in a weekend, we still wanted to try out the Leap Motion kit, so we created Digitalis, Latin for ""_ having finger-like qualities _"", as a way of demoing the interactions possible between the Leap Motion software kit and the Godot game engine tools. ', 'Broadly speaking, Digitalis leverages the Leap Motion software kit to check for and mirror hand gestures into a 3D plane. When certain hand gestures and positions are detected, it plays out an effect.More specifically, Digitalis can do the following:-Fireball: When the program detects that the hand is making a 90 degree angle with the wrist and facing towards the screen, it simulates the launching of a fireball from the position of the hand.-Tracer: When the program detects a pointing gesture on the hand, it rapidly creates particles (approx. 30 per second) which disappear after two seconds, allowing for an effect similar to drawing on the screen.-Lightning: When the program detects the palms are facing each other at a parallel orientation, it generates a stream of electricity between the two palms.', 'We used the godotengine.org with the https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/215 for the majority of development work.

While Matt's lack of Godot experience was surmountable in a reasonable amount of time, the collective non-understanding of real-time 3D particle-based fluid simulation was a dealbreaker.

People are sorting themselves into political echo chambers both on and off the internet. This in turn makes the issue worse, as people fail to ever genuinely interact with those that differ from them ideologically.', 'Convive seeks to solve political polarization by building potentially lasting relationships between people that differ in political beliefs. When creating their account, a user provides information about their interests/hobbies and political views. They are then randomly paired with a user that aligns with their interests, but not with their views. This ideally means the users can connect on things they care about with someone that lies beyond their political echo chamber. Once a chat session is complete, we used natural language machine learning to determine how positive the conversation was. Users are awarded a cryptocurrency (called ""change"") that we built. A very positive conversation equates to more of our currency given.', 'On account creation, the users can select from a list of interests they have. They also answer a few questions to determine where they lie on the political spectrum. The questions are binary, thus the user either moves farther ""left"" or ""right"" with each answer. This is done via Google Forms, which in turn spits out the data to a Google Sheet. A Python script harvests the data and creates user documents on our MongoDB.A (text) chat session is created for two users that have overlapping interests but lie on opposing sides of the spectrum. The users are free to speak with each other for however long they desire.After a chat session is complete, a Python script interfacing with the GCP APIs sends the chat log off for processing. Google returns information regarding the sentiment of the log, which we condense to a number that denotes how successful the interaction was and how much ""change"" to reward the two users.The crypto-currency was built from a small implementation known as ""NaiveCoin.""

While it is difficult to combat deforestation when it is done legally, to clear farmland, or in service of large capitalist enterprises, we can try to stop illegal deforestation. We can surveil the forests and catch deforestation faster. This should make the capture and punishment of the perpetrators easier, which in the long run, should disincentivize the felling of these precious natural resources.

When the microphone on the Arduino senses a chainsaw, it will activate the LED, which will trigger the light sensor on the Raspberry Pi. When the light sensor is triggered, it will use the Wifi Module to send an email to the Forest Service, which will include the coordinates picked up by the GPS. We believe this is an appropriate and effective use of technology, given that all the components are relatively inexpensive, small, and easy to procure, meaning it will not be difficult to widely implement it.
