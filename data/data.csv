It is having 4 major modules:Traffic Feed (Userbase: Drivers, Pedestrians, Passengers): Users can post anything related to city traffic on the feed in order to inform other about it, this will be visible to everyone. Users can add image and tags in their posts to make their posts more comprehensible. Sample content of feed can be accident alert, traffic jam, congestion alert, or general post.  Pedestrian Mode (Userbase: Pedestrians)Activate pedestrian mode while walking on the streets. This will alert you to nearby road intersections, dangers and other hazards related to pedestrian safety. These alerts are given when the user reaches 20m in the range of any potential hazardous geo-location.   Parking Finder (Drivers)Parking finder will show you nearby parking spots and the numbers of current free parking spots in the parking in real time. Real-time data is maintained by another supportive application - Travis Parking Assist which I've built. This app will be used by the watchman of the parking spot to update the number of entries of vehicles in the parking.

"Lucidchart OnPrem for Confluence Server","Others are going cloud—we're taking our top web-based add-on to OnPrem with cutting edge functionality in Confluence","[4640, ""Over 300+ customers have requested an onpremises add-on from Lucidchart. We built this for them, and for all the others who wanted Lucidchart, but were unable to adopt our cloud-based solution.Why it's specialWhile we were not able to replicate all of web-based Lucidchart's functionality (e.g., mobile apps, @mentioning, free integrations, etc.), we still wanted to deliver the premier self-hosted solution for Confluence. Below are a few features that only we are able to offer to customers behind firewalls.Real-time collaboration - multiple editors can diagram together in real-time without overriding each other's edits, enhancing collaboration. Lucidchart OnPrem is the first self-hosted add-on with real-time collaborationIn-editor collaboration - comment on shapes, leave feedback, and record next steps within the diagramPresentation-mode - easily create presentations from diagrams for meetings, or embed as slides in pagesVisio import / export - high-fidelity Visio import and exportAuto-generate diagrams - automatically generate ERDs and other diagrams from source files, like .schemaAll of these features come in addition to the standard functionality of creating, editing, and embedding diagrams, charts, and visuals to improve communication in Confluence. Lucidchart also includes extensive templates and shape libraries for network diagrams, flowcharts, UML diagrams, UI mockups, Venn diagrams, org charts and more. How we built itWe reimplemented some of the back end code of our cloud app within the Confluence environment and tweaked the front end to work with it. In the process we had to make significant changes to core system concepts like users, collaboration, comments, diagrams, and attachments so that they make sense on this new platform. Since this add-on has to work on instances without any internet access, we had to bundle all the necessary resources (js, css, images, fonts, templates, etc.) inside the add-on instead of loading them on-demand from a CDN. Implementing some of our unique features like real-time collaboration was particularly challenging as this is not a feature implemented for Server-based add-ons, and the approach was new to the add-on ecosystem.Challenges we ran intoWe ran into several major challenges in taking the functionality of our add-on from the cloud to fully onpremises. Among these were challenges enabling real-time collaboration, using an embedded rich viewer within Confluence to create slide shows, and taking our 100% cloud-based functionality into a format that can be used entirely behind a firewall.What's next for Lucidchart OnPrem for Confluence ServerWe are currently taking the lessons we learned from building Lucidchart OnPrem and applying them to our web-based Lucidchart add-on. These changes will make both products faster, more reliable, and more valuable to our end users. Aside from the business push, we also plan to continue iterating and improving upon the add-on based on customer feedback. For instance, we will be releasing a new version with improved revision history controls shortly.SummaryJust like taking a Server-based add-on to the Cloud, taking Lucidchart to the Server was challenging and required many large and small changes to our existing product to deliver an excellent solution for our customers.

"Maasto-101","Off-road driver assist BOT thats helps drivers to identify potholes on street, Especially on terrain regions ","[5305, 'While on my trip to a hilly terrain region in remote parts of India, I faced a lot of difficulties to drive through the region, which had challenges like muddy slippery road, lack of street lights and U shaped curves. This was a common problem among tourist and goods travelers in this region frequently, which increased the maintenance cost of their vehicle. I took this as an opportunity to resolve this problem, which gave rise to Maasto-101 ', 'Maasto-101 detects potholes on the streets through image processing and indicates you the depth of the pothole in a 3D visual graph with the exact location of the pothole on the Map. This data is also stored which can be shared with government officials to improve the street conditions. Data collected through frequent analysis of such streets can be collected and sent to Research and Development team to decide upon the material required to fix the street for long term viability. ', 'Maasto-101 Version1 is built using Arduino 101 that transmits  6-axis Gyroscope and Accelerometer data through BLE to Raspberry Pi 3, Here the data is stored for further processing and also a real time 3D graph is drawn using Plotly. NEO 6M GPS attached to Raspberry Pi 3 gives continuous latitude and longitude of the location, those location details are stored in the database and also drawn on Map to give the visual of the location to the driver. A camera attached to Maasto-101 will capture images and process those images to identify potholes. Identified potholes are highlighted with a green box on the actual image and the visual is shared with the user, this helps him to avoid the potholes when he/she drives through the region. The images captured are processed using Open source OpenCV python library.Image captured along with the processed image, location is highlighted on the Map, and a 3D graph of the pothole is drawn on a dashboard to the user. This dashboard can be accessed either in mobile or a tab. ', ""The initial challenge was to get 6-axis accelerometer and gyroscope data over BLE to Raspberry Pi 3, Since there were limitations on the size of bytes transferred over BLE we had to break accelerometer and gyroscope data and transmit both separately with some milliseconds difference. Next was to get the data captured into a visual 3D graph this was done using the Plotly graph, keeping the refresh rate to 5 seconds. 3D graph won't be visible in selected old version devices which don't support WebGL 2.0, As Plotly uses WebGL 2.0 in 3D charts. "", 'We were able to finish up initial MVP version1 of Maasto-101. we were able to overcome the challenges of transmitting data over BLE using trial and error mechanism of various different BLE libraries, visualizing the data taken from 6-axis gyroscope and accelerometer onto a 3D Plotly graph.Maasto-101 version1 will be tested in real scenarios with upgraded toy car for a further reliability of the model.This gives us a boost and confidence to develop the version2 of Maasto-101 which involves high capacity Drone with data analysis on potholes captured.We hope that sharing those statistics with government will help them to improve the current street conditions and give a better living to the people around the region. Improvement in the street conditions will reduce the maintenance cost of goods supplier vehicles and frequent travelers.We are proud of ourselves that we were able to contribute to our society with this innovation and a very big Thanks!!! to Intel Technologies by conducting such a hackathon.

"ChedliTaxi","ChedliTaxi is the “snap-cab” application that lets you instantly catch a taxi without having to wave your hand !","[5344, ""In Morocco, cabs are allowed to have multiple stops to pick up a maximum of three passengers. Therefore, a taxi driver who already has a passenger aboard is constrained to only pick up other passengers _ going the same way_. Eventually, before getting into the cab, the passenger has to ask the driver if they are both going the same direction, which can be  exhausting for both passengers and taxi drivers. In mid-August, my teammate and I came across the Code4Cabs Challenge and found it a great opportunity to contribute to enhancing the taxi-driver/passenger experience in Morocco. In fact, before starting the development of the project, Ali and I have conducted a survey where we have asked more than 120 taxi drivers from Rabat and Casablanca about their preferences about applications they may need. This experience was very enriching as it allowed us to study the real need of taxi drivers which inspired us to come up with ChedliTaxi. According to our survey audience, here is the taxi-driver's wish list:I do not want to stop if the client is not getting into the cab.I need a way to know the client's destination before stopping.I do not want to be stopped by two people when I have only one free seat.I need a service that will tell me where the nearest next potential clients are.I do not want to make detours to reach to clients and find out they are going to a different locations. Unfortunately, all the applications available to users and taxi-drivers are based solely Google Maps and Geocoding APIs, which do not give precise information in Morocco (wrong direction, nonexistent streets.) Worse, although these services can be very efficient when used in developed countries, using them in Morocco just makes the driver's wish list longer.Our idea is to make use of the most powerful CPU in the business, the driver's brain, to judge whether a client is worth picking or not. In fact, the process was mainly inspired from the wish list above; ChedliTaxi lets you send a request with a vocal message to drivers that are on the same street as you, or at most 300 meters away from you. What ChedliTaxi doesThe application comes in a passenger version and a taxi driver one. The typical Chedli Taxi workflow is as follows:The application set the departure point to the current location of the clientThe client records a Voice Message about the destination and chooses the number of seats needed (1 to 3)The application's algorithm takes care of broadcasting the request to only cabs who are in the same street as the client, or those who are at most 300 meters away.The drivers receive the request, see the client position on the map and the number of seats, listen to the voice message, judge the route (as if they were stopped, but without wasting time) then either Accept or Decline the request.The client can track drivers on the mapThe client can choose to send a new request, in which case, the previous request expiresChallenges we ran intoAs we only found out about the project one month and a half ago, developing ChedliTaxi was not a straightforward job. As you may know, proper Android development takes time especially when dealing with a Real-Time communication application (synchronization of tasks...).In fact, we have received many returns with nonexistent streets and wrong directions that made the Exception Handling process very tiring. Accomplishments that we're proud ofWe are glad that the application made it through almost all the tests, from sending the request until having it accepted by a driver. The minimal bugs reported during the testing phase are to be fixed and patched in ChedliTaxi V2.What's next for ChedliTaxiActually, clients will fall in love with ChedliTaxi if there is a big number of drivers using it as well. The client would ideally use the application to find available taxis instantly. Therefore, the next phase is application marketing; we need to have as many drivers and clients using the application.

Our solution? FiB because  With 1.5 Billion Users, Every Single Tweak in an Algorithm Can Make a Change, and we dont stop at just one. ', 'Our algorithm is two fold, as follows:Content-consumption: Our chrome-extension goes through your facebook feed in real time as you browse it and verifies the authenticity of posts. These posts can be status updates, images or links. Our backend AI checks the facts within these posts and verifies them using image recognition, keyword extraction, and source verification and a twitter search to verify if a screenshot of a twitter update posted is authentic. The posts then are visually tagged on the top right corner in accordance with their trust score. If a post is found to be false, the AI tries to find the truth and shows it to you.Content-creation: Each time a user posts/shares content, our chat bot uses a webhook to get a call. This chat bot then uses the same backend AI as content consumption to determine if the new post by the user contains any unverified information. If so, the user is notified and can choose to either take it down or let it exist.

"Open Mind","A Chrome extension to combat fake news and expose readers to differing political viewpoints.","[3587, 'In a sense, social media has democratized news media itself -- through it, we have all become ""news editors"" to some degree, shaping what our friends read through our shares, likes, and comments. Is it any wonder, then, that ""fake news"" has become such a widespread problem? In such partisan times, it is easy to find ourselves ourselves siloed off within ideological echo chambers. After all, we are held in thrall not only by our cognitive biases to seek out confirmatory information, but also by the social media algorithms trained to feed such biases for the sake of greater ad revenue. Most worryingly, these ideological silos can serve as breeding grounds for fake news, as stories designed to mislead their audience are circulated within the target political community, building outrage and exacerbating ignorance with each new share. We believe that the problem of fake news is intimately related to the problem of the ideological echo chambers we find ourselves inhabiting.

Second, the user is given direct feedback on how partisan their reading patterns are, in the form of a dashboard which tracks their political browsing history.

Our people are distributed geographically and across many time zones, working on very large software projects around the clock. Most of the work is done by people that are not in the room with us - people who are awake when we are sleeping. This gap makes it critical to communicate vision, requirements, status and bugs as clearly as possible, or else we’re stuck having to wait until tomorrow to try again.We set out to design something that is a game-changer for remote team communication.  We needed HYFY to be as powerful as video conferencing but not require everyone to be online at the same time.  Our goal is to make HYFY the simplest way to record your screen & voice and share instantly so the team just “gets it.” With a single click, you can narrate a video story of your work and share it immediately wherever your team works.  In our case, that's JIRA and HipChat. "", ""HYFY is a Google Chrome extension that records your screen and voice along with your mouse cursor.  You just click the extension button, select Tab or Full Screen recording and select Start Recording. When you're finished, HYFY gives you a video link that you can copy and paste anywhere.  Viewers can see the video without installing any software.  HYFY also offers direct integration with HipChat and JIRA for sharing into your team's workspace.The FREE version can record a single browser tab for up to 4 minutes.  The PRO version ($5/month) lets you record your full screen or any individual window for up to 60 minutes.  Both versions integrate with HipChat for direct sharing to any group or channel, while the PRO version adds a JIRA integration that allows you to create new JIRA issues or update existing JIRA issues with videos right from within HYFY's share dialog.Here is a sample HYFY that shows you how to get started: Getting Started with HYFYWhat is it good for?Here are some great uses we’ve discovered for HYFY within JIRA and HipChat:documenting customer complaints, bugs and feature requestsproviding support assistance back to customerssharing feedback on a live application or set of comps/screenshotsnarrating a peer deliverable/code reviewrecording sprint reviews and status reportsexplaining product roadmaps or demoing competing productssending feedback to designer and UX prosHOWTOs, walkthroughs, help articles and product demospracticing video broadcasting for upcoming demonstrationstraining videostask list capture/bookmarking "", ""The extension utilizes Google Chrome's desktop capture API for initial screen and voice recording. We then use Chrome's native client capabilities to run native C++ code that encodes the video in a compact WEBM format.

"IRIS","Comprehensive Indoor tracking, control and monitoring solution","[7336, 'While working with one of our customers we realized several manufacturing facilities lack a comprehensive indoor tracking, automation and control system. Most of the available solutions are GPS based, which is not a viable technology indoors. We realized that there is a definitive need for a location based solution that can track, automate and monitor indoor manufacturing facilities. ', 'IRIS is a complete indoor automation solution which uses BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) Beacons and BLE Receivers to track movable assets inside an indoor facility.  Alongside tracking, IRIS aims at automating the different touch-points in a factory like entry and exit boom barriers, weighing scales and loading bays.IRIS also provides a comprehensive event view for the real time position and status of assets on a top view of the facility. The real time view obviously scores over a monitoring based on CCTV as it provides a detailed, qualitative and quantitative information like the weight measured, driver details of the truck, amount of finished good loaded, event history etc.Safety compliance is a major concern for manufacturing facility. There are not many automated ways for detecting non-compliance, thereby endangering the workers in the facility. IRIS uses  a live feed to detect anomalies based on pre-configured rules. A simple non compliance like not wearing a safety helmet is detected real time and an alarm is raised. This reduces the chances of accidents. ', ""There was no better way of demonstrating the solution than actually applying it to a scaled down version of a manufacturing facility.  The first step was to build a scaled down model of the facility with touch points that we could integrate and control electronically. Our scaled down model included functioning boom barriers, weighing scales, Unloading Bays, Parking Areas and Surveillance cameras.A boom barrier, for instance was created using a Servo motor and Ultrasonic Sensors connected to ESP 12E microcontroller. The boom barrier is actuated by commands sent over MQTT by a Raspberry Pi which doubles up as a BLE receiver and IoT Hub client. Each of these devices are registered in Azure's IoT Hub. When a truck (tagged with a BLE beacon) approaches the boom barrier, a series of parameters are sent over to Azure for authentication. The data is validated and an Acknowledged/Not Acknowledged command is sent back to the BLE receiver. Based on the response, the boom barrier is opened. This principle is followed for the weighing scale and loading bay as well.The data captured by the device is passed on to the gateway which is then passed on to IoT Hub. IoT Hub is responsible for passing it on to Logic apps which is in responsible for processing, storing events and responding to the device with commands. The entire model as seen in the video was built using a combination of Actuators (motors), Sensors, Controllers and Raspberry Pis. The weighing scale used CZL 601 Load cell, HX 711 sensor connected to ESP8266 node MCU and the unloading bay used a water pump motor connected to motor driver L298N motor driver, all connected to an ESP 12E NodeMCU.We used toy trucks to model movable assets and proximity BLE Beacons for location tracking of the movable assets indoor. There were several components like the buildings, roads etc that were built for aesthetics and were not necessarily electronically controlled.The compliance was constructed using Deep Learning.A camera is connected to a Raspberry Pi which is running an object detection model based on Google's Mobilenet_SSD. Whenever a human is detected, the frame of the live video is sent over to Azure's CustomVision.Here, we trained a model to check if the input frame consists of a Helmet and Vest, which are two essential wearables for safety. "", ""We became aware of the hackathon a few weeks before the deadline and naturally getting a working model built was a challenge. Right from procuring beacons and other electronics and putting it all together as a working model was challenging.We further ran into issues with interference from WiFi signals and other remote control based equipment which required adjustments in the receivers to siphon out the noise. While beacons are reasonably reliable as locating devices with significant distance between two beacons, in a scaled down model this was a challenge. The beacons had to be re-calibrated along with the receivers to sense two beacons a few centimeters apart.One significant challenge was to build a single script that would run on each of the Raspberry Pi's to make it a BLE receiver, communicate with Azure over MQTT and control other peripherals (boom barrier, weighing scale, loading bay) over a local MQTT network. We had to ensure that the Pi would be robust enough to handle the multiple data transactions, leaving no room for bugs or events that render the receiver in a locked down state. "", 'We were able to put together a fully integrated and functional solution in a short span of time. The scaled down model works as an excellent device to test how the solution could potentially function (or malfunction) in a real life scenario. Our ability to integrate the solution Azure IoT Hub end to end provided us the chance of using several components of Azure which made the back end integration reasonable seamless and simple for us. The client integration with Azure IoT Hub from Raspberry Pi can boast of being reasonably scalable and seamless. ', 'Azure provides a comprehensive ecosystem to connect devices and automate processes. With IoT Hub, Service Bus, Logic Apps and Functions it is possible to configure a new use case in a matter of hours as against days with other conventional approaches.While BLE is a promising technology for indoor navigation elaborate care need to be taken to ensure that the beacons and receivers are properly calibrated and necessary algorithm has been put in place to weed out noise because of interference from other radio sources. ', 'We intend to continue the development of IRIS in a full fledged project to cater to the needs of the industry. At Integration Wizards (www.iwizardsolutions.com) we have substantial experience deploying Industrial IoT solutions to several fortune 500 customers.

It is these realisations that led us to devise a solution for Urban Water management that holds the city dwelling folks accountable for their actions and is easily scalable globally. The solution aspires to use the power of technology to manage not just California’s but the world's water crisis problem and remind everyone that Water is a precious resource that needs to be used wisely. "", 'Our proposal to replace conventional water meters with Samsung ARTIK based Smart meters across California, coupled with a user friendly interactive dashboard with applied business intelligence in the background provides a completely digital and collaborative platform to effectively manage water consumption for consumers and water authorities alike. As the day starts, ARTIK installed in the home receives email from the water authorities and this initiates the filling of water tanks up to the daily limit of water allotted to a particular house. Once the water passes through the flow meter, an impeller rotates and toggles an output line which can be used to calculate the amount of water used. Each pipeline is installed with water flow meters to give water consumed readings for an individual activity. In addition, moisture sensor are provided to measure the moisture level in the areas like garden.An interactive dashboard is designed to provide real time water consumption data to the user. The data is also uploaded to the SAMI cloud simultaneously. In addition to providing live consumption data, the dashboard provides live Twitter tweets and customized water saving tips thus allowing the homeowner to make better informed decisions. The smart meter and dashboard also serves as a link between the homeowner and the water authorities. Homeowner can directly report leaks and other problems to the authorities thus reducing water wastage. They can also view their water bills. For authorities, they can easily track and manage leakage and complaints centrally. They can also easily roll-out new regulations centrally. E.g. The Smart meter can be set to automatically disable the irrigation system for specific postcodes on specific days. (With compliance to privacy laws). ', 'We took the word ‘Bulit’ so seriously that we actually built from scratch, a livable prototype model of a home having living room, kitchen, washroom and a garden area within our startup office space. The new home and bean bag is so comfy that nobody wants to work in their desks anymore!Next step was to make it a ‘Smart Home’. Wandering the market place in the scorching heats of Delhi and digging out the best deal for our sensors, we found that the prices for water meters vary quite drastically (from $250+ for industrial grade sensors to $6 for garden hose attachments that limit total usage based on rough estimates). We settled on a $6 water meter used for water heater (the YF-S201 Hall Effect Water Flow Counter) due to its accuracy, low price, small size, electronic sensing method that could be easily measured by a microcontroller (such as an Arduino) and obviously for its price too! Once we finished enjoying our milkshakes and admiring our new built home, it was time to get to the fun part. Firstly we embedded the water tank and all the pipes with sensors like water flow meters and outdoor garden areas with soil moisture sensor. Secondly, the conventional water meter was replaced with Samsung ARTIK 10. As MQTT has emerged as a standard messaging protocol for IoT, we followed the publish-subscribe (“pub/sub”) model here and ARTIK 10 plays a key role on the network as the ""message broker"". We set up an ARTIK 10 device with Mosquitto to become a simple MQTT broker and used Node-RED development tool to easily send and receive MQTT messages.Since we wanted to have an internet connected data-stream of our water usage from all the pipes, we decided to try out the Node-MCU with built-in WiFi and made them as our edge devices. Each water flow meter is connected to its Node-MCU module having a code for sending water flow readings to the ARTIK running MQTT server. We then subscribed them to messages published to the broker (i.e. ARTIK 10). Data was then sent to the server (i.e. ARTIK 10) at regular intervals when the water source was in use.In total we have used:One flow meter for kitchenOne each for shower, water closet and wash basin respectively.One flow meter for water inlet of tank and one flow meter for water outlet of the tank.Apart from it we have used two water solenoids with Node-MCU which can be controlled wirelessly through ARTIK 10 and being a server connected to internet, the solenoids can be controlled externally by the authorities. First solenoid, integrated with soil moisture sensor for turning on the controlled water supply used for gardening the plants and another on the inlet of water tank. Only gardening solenoid can be controlled via our interactive dashboard.To visualize the data and make sense of water usage patterns over time, we made a dashboard using iobroker.vis on ARTIK 10 to achieve user friendly interactive display. This allowed us to place a display next to the drawing room for immediate feedback, while still offering us a more holistic view to compare multiple sources and look at first-order trends. ', 'We think no HDMI input/output feature enabled on ARTIK 10 until the deadline of this challenge was the bigger challenge for us. This led to us having some problem creating and showing dashboard on ARTIK.While the dashboard was running on the ARTIK itself, but we have accessed it on the network on another machine. If HDMI input/output feature would have been there, we would have ran it locally. But we overcame this challenge by developing our own dashboard from scratch and running it on ARTIK server.Another challenge we faced is with Bluetooth connectivity. Initially we decided to send water consumed data from water flow meters to the ARTIK using ARTIK’s bluetooth. But due to frequent disconnections from the bluetooth we primarily relied on WiFi.We hope that ARTIK Developer community evolves more quickly and more developers start developing their solutions. ', 'We are proud of how we all pulled together as a team, created and tested a working prototype literally from scratch in the short time span. We are proud about all that we have learned in the process and all those late nights of brainstorming which we managed without much caffeine. Sure, there is ample scope for improvements, but the best part is that it proved to us that everything we have thought about and envisioned is definitely possible!  ', 'We have learned a whole new set of skills ranging from building a home to hearing about new terms like MQTT and Mosquitto. We have learned that ARTIK is a powerful tool with immense future. We effectively edited the mosquitto configuration file to listen on multiple ports so we could manage to connect 8 devices (edge devices) to the mighty powerful ARTIK. Working on creating dashboard gave us an insight into the effort required to come up human-centric design that is user friendly and interactive.Data analytics and intelligent cloud management on SAMIIO Cloud enlightened us with the IoT ecosystem and how data can be analysed more lively and intelligent insights can be processed.But most importantly we have learned that our solution has great potential and with teamwork and dedication a lot can be achieved. ', 'Link the dashboards with various Education and Outreach programs that are currently being rolled over in California. After all, learning starts from our homes.Locality / Community based Gamification and introduction of incentives. This will make the water conservation a more social and fun affair.We plan to integrate Ultrasonic sensors with the water pipelines of a street/locality to detect leakages in the pipes and alert water authorities.Making the water flow meters installed in pipes self powered using the flow of the water itself. This will allow to run it continuously without electricity. Develop in-built intelligence to allow ARTIK to take feed from Moisture sensors and compare it with live weather report from internet to make better informed decisions.Potentially collaborate with pipe manufacturing companies to launch new products in the markets which have in-built sensors embedded in them.To test, take feedback, improve and repeat the cycle.

Our talented team includes leaders in transportation management who have vast experience in using software and technology to improve our roadways. While the foundation for this app is already active in several markets, adapting it for this solution took a new approach. ', 'The first challenge we encountered was dealing with limited route options to and from Yilan. The long periods of heavy congestion during holidays are also more significant than what is normally seen in many cities. These limitations actually helped us by forcing us to think outside the box and add a new dimension to our travel-shifting approach. In addition to luring drivers to change their departure times and take new routes, we now also present our users with a list of top destinations that are close-by. In addition to saving them time, this approach goes well with our incentives and rewards program, as we’re able to offer our users a discount to these alternate destinations in exchange for visiting them that day. ', 'Pulling it all off! There was a considerable amount of effort put into this project. To start with, we had to run models and simulations to properly understand and address the fine details of the Taipei-Yilan congestion issue. From there we brainstormed ways to tailor our approach to this unique problem, and once we’d refined our solution the real work began. Plenty of programming and reprogramming (and reprogramming) have gone into this effort. ', ""Heading into this project, we knew that tourism travel is more flexible than the commuter trips Metropia normally targets in urban areas, but even we were shocked by the results of a survey on holiday traffic taken by Taipei drivers. Over 70% of survey respondents indicated that they were willing to travel at a different time, change to a different destination, or both if it meant avoiding the heavy congestion that plagues the Hsuehshan Tunnel. The pain of holiday and weekend traffic to Yilan was resounding, and the public's willingness to change destinations gave us a clear directive to pursue this new feature in our app.Aside from the additional reduction in traffic, guiding people to consider fun attractions around Taipei helps boost local tourism and creates a more vibrant economy within parts of the city that aren't typically seen as holiday destinations. "", ""Our carpooling feature, DUO, is just now reaching the public. We will next look to further reduce the number of vehicles on our roads with multi-modal features that make it easy for our users to take public transportation.

Our back-end was more of a challenge. First we had to analyze the photo we received from the phone. At first, we tried to use an LSTM based OCR processing tool called Tesseract. It seemed to work properly only half the time, so we tried to find something better. The big problem with OCR is that all the good systems are proprietary so we had to go with Azure's OCR offering. It works quite well. After getting the text out of the image we had to process it. We had made an attempt at vectorizing the words we got and tried creating a conditional random field model. The problem is that they mostly ignore the order of words, so it didn't work for us. Something like an LSTM would have probably worked better, but we didn't have enough data and it was outside the scope of this hackathon. So we resorted to designing a hand made tool-set that we used to process the words. Overall from a technical perspective the whole process works quite well.

As a lot of people share apartment buildings, it is indeed more convenient to share gardens than to have their own. ', 'With that in mind, we decided to create a smart garden platform that is meant to make sharing gardens as fast, intuitive, and community friendly as possible. ', ""We use a plethora of sensors that are connected to a Raspberry Pi. Sensors range from temperature to light-sensitivity, with one sensor even detecting humidity levels. Through this, we're able to collect data from the sensors and post it on a google sheet, using the Google Drive API.Once the data is posted on the google sheet, we use a python script to retrieve the 3 latest values and make an average of those values. This allows us to detect a change and send a flag to other parts of our algorithm.For the user, it is very simple. They simply have to text a number dedicated to a certain garden. This will allow them to create an account and to receive alerts if a plant needs attention.This part is done through the Twilio API and python scripts that are triggered when the user sends an SMS to the dedicated cell-phone number.We even thought about implementing credit and verification systems that allow active users to gain points over time. These points are earned once the user decides to take action in the garden after receiving a notification from the Twilio API. The points can be redeemed through the app via Interac transfer or by simply keeping the plant once it is fully grown. In order to verify that the user actually takes action in the garden, we use a visual recognition software that runs the Azure API.

"Marauder mApp V2","A community-based &amp; crowdmapping application that provides a virtual companion to enhance street safety.","[13317, '628,521… was the total amount of reported criminal attacks against students on their way to and from school in the US elementary, secondary & universities campuses on 2014. From this amount, around 40 were murders and almost 170,000 were classified as serious violent victimizations such as rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault [1]. We see these numbers more than a mere statistics but lives that were marked because of an unfortunate event.Also, between 2001 and 2013 on average 4% of students reported being afraid of an attack or harm on the way to and from school. This makes at least 2 million students in the U.S. (plus their parents) likely to be interested in using the application [1].So, how to improve our youngest’ safety? How to help them decide which is the safest path to their destination? Or even better, how to watch their steps remotely?We are living in a dynamic world in which everything is evolving at a very fast pace, even the way crimes are committed. We believe that people’s collaboration can make powerful contributions. Detroiters are already turning this belief into action by releasing the Detroit Strategic Framework Plan which is “a guiding blueprint for transforming Detroit from its current state of population loss and excessive vacancy into a model for the reinvention of post-industrial American cities” (Griffin, Cramer, & Powers, 2014) [2]. So the purpose is to design a community-based & crowdmapping application to enhance public safety by connecting you to a relative or friend by sharing your route so they keep an eye on you. As the security threats expert Marc Goodman puts it: “After all, public safety is too important to leave to the professionals”.Why is this app relevant to Detroit’s needs?Although this is an application for any pedestrian and/or driver located in any city, we identified the following reasons for which Detroit, initially, will be interested in this solution:Public safety is frequently addressed across the imperatives on the Detroit Strategic Framework Plan as evidence of citizen’s priority [3].At the Wayne State University & Wayne County Community College District campuses alone, an average of 87 criminal offenses per year were reported during 2012-2014 [4].There were more than 530 carjacking offenses, 2,600 street robberies and 9,100 aggravated assaults reported in Detroit on 2015 [5].There were 54,483 people involved in 22,833 crashes within Detroit in 2015 [6].Enables citizens to commute anytime and anywhere feeling safer, thus, increase economic growth, as “public safety plays a critical role in supporting economic growth and vitality by reducing the cost of crime and enhancing the desirability of communities as places to live and locate businesses”(Keeling & Cleverley, 2012) [7].Increase continuous improvement by creating a feedback loop empowering citizens participation by monitoring safety concerns within their neighborhood public areas.High people density with tech devices making them target to crimes.What it DoesMarauder mApp enhance security throughout your route (walking, public transport or car) by connecting you to a relative or friend by sharing your route so they can watch your real-time path remotely. It also enables you to foresee any security alerts, street lights that are not working or hazards raised by other active users. Thanks to this you will be able to find the best path with the least dangers.The application displays an emergency button to call 911 and it also features a panic mode which alerts your virtual watcher if you are in trouble (New feature). This panic mode is triggered automatically if you suddenly drop your mobile and/or run or while driving if a car door is opened or the airbags deployed (This feature is not included on the Demo yet). When triggered it will begin a countdown of 5 seconds allowing you to dismiss the alert in case of a false alarm. When driving the alert can be dismissed by a voice command (This feature is not included on the Demo yet). We envision the application to be compatible with smart cities initiatives, such as street lights that are equipped with motion sensors and cameras. This way Marauder mApp can give life to your route by enabling you and your virtual companion to watch your path in advance with real-time activity and pictures streamed from outdoor street lights --- this real-time data version is available on the demo.While driving, Marauder mApp provides traffic data along your route (New feature). This uses the GE Current street light data which provides traffic information such as the amount of cars in your route and the lanes used.What makes this possible?Although Marauder mApp can be implemented with smartphone technology alone, its experience can be enhanced by leveraging car hardware modules (e.g. OpenXC) and city infrastructure such as public lighting technology (e.g. GE Current motion sensors and cameras).The video streaming, pedestrian and traffic information rely on the GE Predix platform and its usage of GE Current street lights. The use of Predix and the GE Current street lights are not the only options to gather this information. Any cameras and other type of sensors with internet capabilities can be integrated with Marauder mApp. For example, the cameras installed on highways by the State of Michigan could be hooked up to provide video (http://mdotnetpublic.state.mi.us/drive).The panic mode feature can be enabled with current smartphone technology. Sudden motions such as the phone falling or a user running can be detected both in iOS and Android devices. The panic mode for the vehicle users can be implemented using the OpenXC platform. Marauder mApp can be connected to the car ODB-II port via Bluetooth allowing the application to extract information from the vehicle such as the doors, airbag status and vehicle emergency codes.MVP Testing Instructions & FeaturesGo to http://godetroit.iamweb.com:3000/Create an account --- you can use fake e-mail if preferred, test@user.com works.Click on ""Create Route’.Input ""365-399 Broadway, San Diego, CA 92101, USA"" in the From text box [a].Input ""1402 K Street, San Diego, CA 92101, USA"" in the To textbox [a].Let the Marauder mApp know if your are walking or driving.Click on ""Get Route"".MVP Demo ExplanationA map will show up displaying the recommended route. The traced path indicates the three GE Current streetlights available as dots. Every time there is activity within the LED sensor’s range a location marker will pop-up. If you roll your mouse over any of these markers, the total count of people in the area will pop-up.At the bottom of the screen, images streamed from the recommended route’s outdoor streetlights will be displayed. Share your route by clicking on ""Share"".If clicked on your cell phone will send the route link to any friend on Whatsapp [b].If clicked on a desktop browser, the share button will copy the route’s URL to the clipboard to be shared as needed.You can click the emergency button which will display the alert message your watcher would see.Additionally, there is a yellow “Panic Demo!” button. Clicking it will trigger panic mode and will display a dialog with a countdown.If the countdown goes down to zero an alert message that would be shown to your watcher will appear.You can click the “I’m okay” button which will stop the countdown and bring you back to your route.You can click the “I need help!” button which will display the alert message.Note a: This is the only route that works on this MVP as the LED sensors are narrowed down to this area.Note b: Whatsapp is supported as an example. Other messaging applications such as SMS, iMessage or Facebook Messenger can be added.What’s New on Marauder mApp goDetroitShare and watch routes not only walking but on car as well.Notify your virtual companion once you have arrived.New panic mode triggered by running, airbag deployment and other events.New 911 emergency button.Gather traffic data from the Predix platform.What’s Next for Marauder mAppCommunicate street light sensors to coordinate traffic lights for a rapid traffic flow.Trigger the panic mode if the user runs and/or drops the mobile.Leverage OpenXC while driving to trigger the panic mode by monitoring the user’s vehicle: Panic mode starts if the vehicle doors are opened or the airbags are deployed.Add a new “I’m nervous” button.  When clicked the user needs to keep it pressed. If the finger is removed trigger the panic mode.Enable active users to share real-time security alerts, street lights that are not working, accidents, and other hazards.Enable virtual companion to recommend pedestrian to change route.Filter streamed camera images by selecting streetlight on the map.Position the pedestrian being watched on the map. (Currently can be done but for demonstration purposes, since there are only 3 sensors in San Diego).How was the Project built?Marauder mApp is built on Javascript with Node.js, MongoDB and the Meteor Framework. This is used to create a lightweight web application that can be executed either on desktop or mobile and that can display information on real time.To display the information the GE Predix platform is used. The project consumes four Predix microservices: User Account and Authentication, Pedestrian Planning, Public Safety and Traffic Planning. GE’s Intelligent Environment Public Safety API service provides real-time and historical images/video from each intelligent LED light installed in a city.Accomplishments we are proud ofThe project is able to trace routes that contain the GE Current streetlights and Cameras as way-points so that the route you take can be watched. The real time sharing of information is really powerful because the pedestrian does not need to have the phone on the hand, and suspicious activity is noted by the watcher, a message or a phone call will make them change the route.Projected Use-CaseAlice wants to go from the University to her house late at night after a long study session. She pulls her mobile, opens Marauder mApp and enters her destination, she then decides to send a request to her friend Bob so that he can keep an eye on her journey home.While Bob makes himself a sandwich, he gets a few pictures of Alice getting outside of the University from his home computer. Dinner in hand, he checks some images from a couple of blocks ahead of Alice. Seen everything looks fine he goes back to his dinner and starts reading a book.Every few blocks the application asks Alice for a notification on how she\'s doing. Bob can look at images from cameras Alice has passed by while he enjoys his evening. (This feature is not included on the Demo yet)After some time into his placid watch, Bob gets a notification to his mobile. Turns out some pedestrian activity has been detected some blocks away from Alice. With a few clicks Bob checks the images from around that area. It looks like a couple took out their dog for a night walk. He decides not to change Alice\'s suggested path and goes back to his dinner.Once Alice gets home she sends a last notification to Bob thanking him for his watch. Bob sees Alice has arrived home safe while brushing his teeth, turns off his application and goes to sleep.ReferencesOffice of Postsecondary Education of the U.S. Department of Education & The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).Griffin, T., Cramer, D., & Powers, M.

From telecom towers, to hospitals and corporate offices and manufacturing facilities depend heavily on Diesel Gen-sets to provide for a power backup. In the as - is scenario, the Diesel generator manufacturers and owners depend heavily on manual scheduled maintenance to ensure that they do not malfunction and continue to operate optimally.  Needless to say a manual process is error prone and inefficient leading to malfunction of the Gen-sets. In the age of Industrial IOT Gen-sets qualify as critical infrastructure and a real time monitoring is necessary. ', 'Most of the Gensets come equipped with a controller that allows us an access to vital information. Lumos uses a device built on Aurdino and Raspberry Pi 3 that connects to the serial port and receives information via MODBUS protocol. The Raspberry PI has a GPRS module that allows it to connect to IOT Hub. The device runs IOT Hub client responsible for communicating information to IOT Hub seamlessly and securely. IOT Hub routes the telemetry received to Azure streaming. The telemetry is also separately stored on Cosmos DB. The visual layer of the application consists of Angular 5 with embedded power BI dashboard which is fed by Azure streaming to provide it realtime information about the Genset in question. Lumos can also be downloaded on iOS and Android devices as native mobile applications. The mobile app provides the capability of viewing the current and historical information about the Genset.

"IoT Fridge Saver","Reduce the consumption of refrigerators by just circulating the air in the rear.","[13507, 'The idea comes from one of the team members, when one day he discovered that his electric bill was too high. This led him to research to find some way to measure the electrical consumption of his house.Found the Open Energy Monitor website. It is a system that allows to measure the electrical consumption using Arduino. This changed everything because he did not depend on third parties to do an analysis of his appliances.Suddenly he looked at the refrigerator, what was happening? This appliance was the most consuming per day in the whole house by far.Investigating more in depth he discovered several interesting matters about refrigerators. But perhaps, the most important was that due to the heat that concentrates behind these devices, their electricity consumption increases between 15% and 25%.This was the seed of this project.How a refrigerator worksThe operation of a refrigerator consists of transferring the heat from the interior to the exterior. This allows the temperature inside the fridge to be much lower than the ambient temperature of the room.If there is not enough place to be exhausted, the hot air that expels the appliance itself condenses in the back, affecting compressor efficiency. This causes a longer time needed to cool and as a consequence, an increase in the electric consumption. ', ""A possible solution is to ventilate the rear through a fresh air flow. This can be achieved in several ways, giving more space in the back or moving the air with fans.But of course, all this makes no sense if we do not have consumption data and temperatures. This is where Arduino comes into play, where we will connect the temperature and power consumption sensors to transmit them to a database in the cloud.Posed the problem and a possible solution, we already had where to start the project.BackgroundBefore I get fully involved in explaining what the project is and how we are developing it, I will put you in a position.There are more than 7 billion people in the world. One in five has a refrigerator in their house. That's more than 1.5 billion refrigerators.This appliance is one of the few that is on 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. This means that each refrigerator consumes an average of 450 KWh per year. If we multiply the number of refrigerators around the world (1,5 billion) and the annual consumption of each, the total leaves 649 million MWh of annual consumption.If we look at it from another perspective, we can state that all home refrigerators in the world consume more than a country like Germany.Source wikipediaTherefore, supposing we could reduce the consumption of all the refrigerators in the world by 10%, we would be saving a total of 64.9 million MWh per year. If a KWh equals 0.62 kg of CO2, we would avoid pouring 42,185,000,000 kg of CO2 into the atmosphere.The mere fact of having consumption data of household appliances, makes your electric bill to be reduced by 10%. As we will see throughout this project, this device can be used for other appliances. This implies that we may have considerable electric bill savings . "", ""The central axis of this project is the Arduino 101. This board takes the Intel Curie microcontroller.It is a small but complete chip. Among its features it has a built-in IMU or Inertial Measurement Unit that has an accelerometer and gyroscope and Bluetooth connectivity through BLE or Bluetooth Low Energy technology.One important thing to keep in mind with this prototype board is that you have to have the most current Firmware possible. This is because what you are actually doing is emulating an Arduino.To update the Firmware follow these instructions.Going back to the initial approach of the project, we must do several things with the Arduino 101. Measure various temperatures, power consumption and control the fans to generate that fresh air flow in the back of the refrigerator.Particularly, we made the decision to measure back side temperature, front temperature, freezer and refrigerator. This gives us 4 temperature sensors and a sensor to measure the electrical consumption.For data collection, we used the DS18B20 temperature sensor and the SCT-013 sensor that measures the electrical consumption.It is not mandatory to use these models, any other similar sensor can be used to obtain the temperature and consumption information.DS18B20 Temperature SensorThe Maxim Integrated DS18B20 temperature sensor offers a temperature range between -55 ° C and 155 ° C, with an accuracy of ± 0.5 ° C.The model we use is the commercialized as a waterproof probe avoiding any problem inside the refrigerator or freezer. This sensor uses Maxim Integrated's 1-Wire communication protocol allowing the simultaneous connection of more than 100 sensors through a single pin.Electric consumption sensor SCT-013To measure consumption, we use a non-invasive current sensor. So we do not worry about having to alter the refrigerator power cord too much. The only thing we have to do is peel the cable and embrace only one of the two power cables, live or ground.This type of sensors are known as Current Transformers and one of the most common is the SCT-013. They operate under the principle of electromagnetic induction. The output of these sensors is an intensity proportional to that which passes through a cable or electric circuit.There are two types of sensors, which provide either a current or a voltage. The same thing you use, but the simplest is the one that offers us a voltage.FansFinally we connect the fans. Taking into account the consumption, dimensions and noise they can generate. We can use any model, but we must keep a close eye on these components since there are different models for different uses and not all are worth.The idea is to be able to adapt the project to use the typical fans of the computers since they consume very little and are very economic. Those who are testing José Manuel and Germán are Boxer Fan type.Connecting Arduino 101 to the InternetAlthough, as I said, it is a very robust and very useful plate, the big drawback is that it does not have an Internet connection. This forced us to look for solutions to send all the information acquired to a platform in the cloud.There are different options like using Bluetooth to connect to another device that has an Internet connection. But perhaps the simplest and cheapest we found was to use a NodeMCU.This development kit is based on the ESP8266 and is very easy to use (it is compatible with the Arduino IDE) and comes at a very economical price and have a library to configure WiFi like WiFiManagerAll logic of the project resides in the Arduino 101 and NodeMCU only makes bridge between the plate and Internet.Send information to the platform in the cloudThe data must be visible in real time at all times. Only then will we verify if the project is viable and we can make the right decisions.As a cloud platform we choose Firebase, then we will detail its features.One of its advantages is that it is very easy to use thanks to the REST API that incorporates. With only one HTTP call we can store the data obtained from temperature, consumption and use of the fans.All of this is sent in JSON format. Therefore, the integration between Firebase and NodeMCU is instantaneous.The Firebase databaseThe features we seek to integrate a cloud service into this project are ease and cost. At present there are many services that we can get to use like Thingspeak, ThingerIO or the Arduino Cloud itself. All may be a good choice.But perhaps because of our experience in web development, we chose Firebase. The first thing to note is that you have APIs for many programming languages \u200b\u200bamong which JavaScript is found.The database has limitations as it is a free account.It does not allow more than 100 simultaneous connections.You have a limit of 1 GB of storage.You have a limit of 10GB of download.With all this, our project after a month of data collection every minute of two refrigerators, we have a storage consumption of 3.9 MB and 158.4 MB of download.Web application for data visualizationWith everything previously mounted, there is nothing left to see the information in a friendly way on any device.If we want to monitor the data in real time, from anywhere in the world and any device, one of the faster options is to create a web application.Firebase has a Javascript API that makes it very easy to integrate a database from this platform into a web page.In addition we added the Bootstrap framework for it to be responsive. We have used an open template for this framework, SB Admin 2.All this has resulted in a website that can be viewed at www.iotfridgesaver.com. It consists of two screens.The initial screen shows a map of Google where we will be locating the different refrigerators that are used.Once you find the one you want to consult, just give the icon and click on info. From here you can access the historical temperature, consumption and use of fan. "", ""There have been many challenges we have faced in this project. First the integration of a board without an Internet connection.We solved this by using a board based on the ESP8266 as NodeMCU. Perhaps there is a much better solution but the simplest and fastest was this.At the time of performing rear ventilation, the problem that we have found is mainly how to make a fresh air flow to lower the temperature.We have followed different phases to decide when to turn on the fans.In a first phase we have done a data collection to analyze the information.They are then manually activated to check what happens in certain situations. This led us to think that the temperature difference between the back and the front was a good indicator of high consumption..However, as we were collecting data we realized one thing. The best time is when the compressor is activated and at the same time the rear temperature increases. It is much easier in terms of programming to control this situation.Undoubtedly, the back temperature is closely linked to the compressor activity.We need to do further investigation, but first tests show that there may be about 20% energy efficiency improvement activating air flow.We checked that, when blower moves air behind refrigerator, compressor activity and inner temperature reduction speed are significantly reduced.Accomplishments that we are proud ofWe are very proud to have achieved a system that is capable of two tasks. On the one hand control hidden parameters of the refrigerators to the users.On the other hand have been able to minimize electricity consumption in certain conditions.At a first stage, asigning temperature sensors to each point of measurement was difficult. We had to check their hardware addresses to identify them and write it into source code. Now, we use temperature differences to identify sensors automatically. This makes easier to setup the system.There is no doubt that there is still a long way to go in this project, but with the mere fact of having all this information we can help people reduce the consumption of their appliances.What we have learnedAbove all we have learned one thing, how refrigerators work. We have detected that in many occasions it is made an abuse of them.Just by applying a few modifications to the installation, we can reduce its consumption. But all this is not possible if we do not have analytical data to corroborate it.This is where open technologies come into play. They give us the possibility to create devices that adapt to our requirements. Without these technologies none of this would be possible.We have also found that there may be huge differences in the consumption of different refrigerators. This project can help identify the most efficient models.Only if we know the world around us, can we change it.What's next for IoT Fridge SaverThe following steps we have planned are as follows:Improve data storage through Firebase. One database per user.Make summaries of the histories to show them in the home.Make historical data private for each device.Change the device settings on the web through a form.Activate or deactivate fans remotely.Conduct a socio-economic study in different countries.Built Witharduino-101bootstrapds18b20firebasejquerynodemcusct-013Try it outwww.iotfridgesaver.comprogramarfacil.comgithub.com      Submitted to    Intel Hacks 2017Winner                Popular Choice                  Created by  One of the most consumed appliances in homes are refrigerators. At times, you can reach consumer peaks that trigger electric bills.It can be due to several factors but the one that influences more is the little air circulation in the rear part of the same one.By circulating a fresh air stream in the back, this consumption could be reduced.

"PowAgri","Your Dream Farming is Now in Your Power Hand","[6114, ""Couples of years ago we tried to develop a project which helps a farmer to choose appropriate crop to improve the crop production as well as the income. But due to the scarcity of data we could not able to develop that app. During that time we survey and talked with some our relatives who are directly and closely related to the farming. We observed that farmers choose a crop to harvest based on the previous couple of years crop production, harvesting cost and price. They choose a crop usually based on information available from the agriculture officer, the memorized data or information collects from their neighborhood peoples. Agriculture officer usually advice farmers based on some text based data. But retrieve useful information from the memorized data or a text based data cannot help a farmer to visualize meaningful information. Also these data set has limited data which is unable to effectively help any decision making process.USDA has several data set which has a lot of agriculture related data. By leveraging these data we can help farmers in choosing and comparing several corps. In PowAgri we leverage the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) to help the farmers to choose the most productive and valuable crops by visualizing data in the most intuitive way. The main target user of PowAgri are the farmers, so they want to use any tools which  can help farmers in the easiest way. We can visualize information by choosing many attributes, but this is not a practical way for a farmers. Keeping this issues in minds we design our app PowAgri which is an easy to use tools to help farmers in their decision making process. Just a single tap farmers can visualize the information and can make appropriate decision using these data.App IntroFarming is the greenest business. Like any other business, in agriculture farm, farmer keep a log of their crops or products productivity like how much they produce, price or harvested area. Keeping this farm logs or data will be worthy, if they can get meaningful information to improve their farm production. USDA also maintains several dataset to keep the agriculture related data. Except the researcher or a text based data is not very meaningful to farmer, because retrieving meaningful information or analysis is very troublesome for a farmer from these dataset. To resolve these issues, we develop a very easy to use app “PowAgri” to provide a meaningful insight to both the farmer and the researcher so that they can visualize all the data in a meaningful way.Key Features:  PowAgri is very easy to use tools for every farmers and researcher to select best crops or compare crops in several attributes. Just a single tap PowAgri visualize data to farmers for helping the decision making process.  PowAgri helps farmers to choose appropriate crops for a particular state based on some farming characteristic like yield, price received, area harvested or area planted.  Farmers can get insight about which crops is the most productive in their surrounding areas.  Compare crop tools helps farmers and researchers  to know which crops harvest better than the other crops in terms of yield, production, price, expense and other several attributes.  Price analysis tools helps farmers to know the market price of a particular crop in a particular state  PowAgri provide the expense information to the farmers for a particular states.Overall PowAgri leverage the USDA NASS data set to help farmers in their decision making process.How It WorksChallenges I ran intoThree years ago we tried to develop an app like PowAgri. But in that time we did not have enough information, as a result we could not complete our project. On the other hand, after seeing a lot of data in USDA datasets we faced a sweet problem: how to visualize the data to farmers for helping in their decision making process. There are several ways we can visualize data by choosing desired options. But it is not very easy way for a farmer. As our main target user are farmers, we spend a many many hours to design the UX of the apps. We studied a lot of survey, reports and agriculture guidelines to design our app. We also spend a lot of times to determine which information is very important to the farmers so that they can use this information to improve their farming. But at the end we successfully mange and visualize these to the user in the easiest way.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofAt the very beginning of the PowAgri development process, we were afraid that how to manage these huge dataset and how we can visualize these data to the farmers so that they can use this tool without any headache. We spend hours and hours to simplify the data visualization process. We spend countless hour and design a lot of wireframe to develop an user friendly UX and data visualization.

With our variety, we analyzed certain basic aspects (below) which led to the inspiration.Deluge of mails & managing is an herculean taskDisparate tools used to manage your team, activities, tasks etc. & they work in silosEmail is main media of communication & is not effectively used in projects Tools like MS project etc. are expensive, steep learning curve & does not trickle to the last team memberWork transition is a fixed handicap which normally consumes lot of resources## What it doesU@Work is envisaged to be a simple and light weight project management solution on top of Office 365 Outlook platform. So, from the email window, with intuitive user interface and menu options, Users for example can define project work elements, meetings, tasks, allocate resources and also track progress from a rich visual Dashboard.U@Work Creates a folder structure (as that of a Project WBS structure) across the team & any correspondence with respect to a specific project/activity/ will be routed to the recipient project/activity in the same order. Tasks can be associated to projects & activities, people can be assigned to activities and tasks, meeting action items can be tracked and health of projects monitored with data & metrics providing insightful infographics auto-rolled up to the Dashboard. This automatically adheres to ISO & COBIT.Task & Meeting lifecycle Management.Real time dashboard on various status of Tasks / Action items.Works on Office 365 & Outlook.com.A Patent Pending product, presently, U@Work is being realised as a product add-in, integrated to work with Microsoft Outlook Office 365 and Outlook.com email platform.Some of the project management features realised so far are; Manage Work: Users can create, manage by directly defining project, activities, sub-activities etc. and assign people to a project, activities from within the context of an email in Outlook. Allows multiple project creation and can be managed from user interface and monitored from Dashboard.Dashboard: U@Work add in provides a dashboard view where the users can view metrics of project summary, task status, meeting metrics and Gantt chart.Team on Same Page: Manager shares project details to team members with a single click. The sharing happens via email being sent to people whom activities, sub-activities etc. have been assigned.Auto-Organise folders: On receipt of first project email, similar project (folder) structure as configured by Manager will be created in every team member’s mail box automatically, thus bringing uniformity in structuring project & communication across team, ground up.Auto-Organise project emails: From UI, when any team member sends email with context set by selecting Project, Activity, Sub-activity etc., emails get automatically routed to respective folders in the recipient’s mailbox. Communication is organised ground up and saves effort and time.Manage Tasks: From UI, create tasks against project, activity, sub-activity etc., and assign to any team member. Team members can update task status and the data is rolled to Manager and dashboard.Manage Meetings: Covers elements such as invite, calendar, meeting minutes, track outcome, mainly decisions and action items. Meeting metrics are rolled up to dashboard.Resources: From UI, Team members can notify their non-availability, example leave, vacation etc. This detail is rolled to the Manager and also routed to the respective project folder and metrics updated in the dashboard.Note: For installing U@Work add-in on Outlook 365, side load the Manifest from the URL which is given in ""Try it out"" section below.

The APIs and plug-in integration approach is not the same and varies from provider to provider. This can be analogous to developing an application with same features and user interface to run on different operating systems.Getting to depth, The APIs and plug-in development and integration approach between Microsoft Outlook desk top version and Microsoft Outlook Office 365 is totally different. For instance, MAPI is used for Microsoft Office desk top version, which is different from using the latest & evolving Microsoft Graph technology for Exchange & Office 365, which is again different from using web hooks provided by Outlook APIs to directly interact with Outlook as part of Office 365.Plug-in technology is also evolving and not exercised by many so far. Initially, while examining feasibility options, lot of time and effort went in, even to make samples work. Also, lack of documentation aggravated the problem and debugged to figure out missing pieces and discover remedies. For example, first instance to make U@Work visible in the email window was a significant effort. Next steps to process user actions, when clicked, were no different.U@Work requires to interact with user mail box and email exchange server. As Microsoft Graph is also evolving, very few APIs are exposed limiting functionality that can be realised. Also, had to experiment a lot, due to insufficient technical documentation and usage examples. Another uncertainty is to battle possible changes to APIs, as they are still in beta and not released to production. Already faced a situation once, where change in API syntax broke U@Work. Presently, we use a combination of both Microsoft Graph and web hooks for Outlook APIs.Emails can arrive to any mail box at any point in time.

So, to synchronise and process in real time, (even when users have not logged into the mail box and U@Work) a separate service was built to run 24*7 to run in the background.With Microsoft Outlook Office 365, mail box can be accessed from popular browsers such as Internet Explorer, Edge, Chrome and Microsoft Outlook desk top versions (2013 & 2016). When it comes to user interface, size and form factor of the dedicated pane exposed for plug-ins to render varies between browser and desktop email clients. Also, there is no feature parity yet between browser and desktop version. For example, in case of Outlook desktop version plug-in can appear in the main menu bar.

"UPTEAMIST","A simple intranet platform for small and medium businesses","[4584, ""Our team has been an Office 365 / SharePoint consulting service for the last four years. We began to notice that small and medium-sized businesses were continually asking us for the same features: an Intranet platform that is simple to manage, able to quickly create content, and easy to use by people of all skill sets. Considering the short adoption rates of platforms such as SharePoint, we decided to provide a different experience that helps SMBs better adopt O365 and leverage all of its feature.What It DoesUPTEAMIST allows teams to quickly create and share announcements, pages, links, documents, and events. Additionally, users can manage permissions and tags so that content is always readily available to those who need it. The UPTEAMIST platform integrates directly with Office 365 so that team members can use their enterprise email addresses to access the system and start sharing instantly.How We Built ItUPTEAMIST is built on Azure and integrates with Microsoft Graph API, SharePoint REST API, and StripeJS. A Node.js application manages the subscription platform, while the user-facing portal is built on .NET with AngularJS. We have been working on the project since March 2017.Challenges We EncounteredAs UPTEAMIST integrates directly with SharePoint, most of the challenges emerged as we worked with the SharePoint REST API. For example, in the case of a document upload, UPTEAMIST needs to contend with not only its own built-in permission system, but also SharePoint's permission system. To effectively handle this, we needed to ensure that the permissions set on UPTEAMIST were mirrored in SharePoint.We had many internal discussions concerned with how to best simplify the interface and the actions provided to end users. If we made it too simple, the platform might not have enough features to make the service useful. If we made it too complicated, we figured we might as well just continue recommending SharePoint. With the issue of balance in mind, the design team went to work - and continues to adjust and update - to ensure that we are providing the right amount and type of features to our users.AccomplishmentsOverall, we are very proud of the work our team has done to get the platform up and running. The connection to Azure AD is working great, as is the connection to Stripe to manage subscriptions and payments. As of this application's date of submission, already two dozen alpha users are on the platform and providing us with insightful feedback.What We LearnedAs an agency that provides consulting services, we had to re-learn processes and procedures from the product development perspective. Although the design, development, and quality control methods were roughly the same, much more thought needed to be dedicated towards marketing, customer feedback, and support. We want to ensure that our product answers a community need, and that new feature requests are realized and implemented quickly. Our goal is to improve the tool so that it perfectly fits the needs of modern, small to medium-sized organizations.What's Next for UPTEAMISTFor the remainder of 2017, our plan is to continue to work with our alpha - and eventually beta - users to refine our product features. Our product road map for 2018 is arranged into quarters. In the first quarter, we want to move UPTEAMIST out of beta and into V1. The second quarter will be dictated by the feedback we receive from our initial users, and it will include the implementation / integration of Project Online and Dynamics CRM Online. The third quarter will include rolling-out an iOS / Android application developed using Xamarin. In the fourth quarter, we plan to work with the Cognitive Services API to integrate speech recognition so that users can interact directly with the Intranet via voice command.A quick introductionhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/EL4uo8tZ6LUBuilt With.netangular.jsc#graph-apinode.jssharepoint-rest-apisignalrTry it outsubscription.upteamist.comwww.upteamist.com      Submitted to    Hack Productivity 3    Created by  I contributed as the product manager and ensure of the progression of our first feature set and respect of the timelineKhoa Quach "", ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['graph-api', 'node.js', 'signalr', 'sharepoint-rest-api', 'c#', 'angular.js', '.net']","False","77","['quachhongak']","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/542/610/datas/small.jpg","True","9"

Front-end only frameworks tend to grow in popularity much faster than full-stack frameworks because there are so many developers with legacy apps that want to update the UI without rebuilding the entire app.A hosted service is good for an API provider who wants to provide a DDP API without doing more work, it can be thought of like a proxy. But a developer who wants to consume a REST API might not want to go through a hosted proxy and might want to be able to subscribe to REST API's directly within their app.So we would like to extract the core functionality into a package so that any Meteor app can easily subscribe to a REST API and receive live updates over DDP.

One day I had to move from one place to another in my city, normally I took me about 15 minutes but that day, the traffic was crazy and took around 55 minutes. That day I realized that the congestion was mainly caused by the people in their cars, because around a 90% of these were occupied by only one person. As soon as I realized that, I started to work next to a group of friends in these project so that we could promote a more sustainable mobility. ', 'Wheels is a social network for mobility, where members offer and demand routes with their friends or colleagues to share their cars, taxi services or bicycle plans. Thus, in this network users can take, for each route, a role: passenger, driver, taxi sharer or cyclist. This social network is a platform that serves to enable people to share their vehicles, taxi services or bicycle plans for its recurrent trips such as going from home to work or college and vice versa routes. However, unlike the various initiatives of carpooling in the market, we guarantee to the users conditions of safety and security because people never interact with strangers, but with known people of confidence from three main groups: friends (Facebook or friends who are in your contact list), colleagues (the university or work, can interact by having active institutional mail) and contacts (private groups for neighbors, private groups for people doing sports on weekends, etc). Thanks to Wheels cars, taxis and bicycles in the cities can increment the occupancy rate because the more we promote initiatives like carpooling, more people will start to shift their mobility patterns to start a new way of travelling. Also, we are aiming to work next to transportation agencies so that they can use our data to generate solutions in the cities. ', 'Wheels was created using the most advanced technological tools on the market (digital maps, mechanism digital confirmation of the information, algorithms to match, etc.) to offer a service that aims to improve the welfare of the society. In that sense Wheels operates for each of the different existing operating systems on the market (Android, IOS (iPhone), and in Web version. Thanks to the Wheels design, you can create a route specifying how much are you willing to walk, how much time will you spend traveling and how much CO2 are being saved by the users thanks to the use of Wheels. ', 'The challenges Wheels is running into are to massify our services in all the cities around the world, especially in the cities located in the emerging countries because it is there where there are big concerns with the mobility.

', 'We have learned that the most important thing to promote carpooling in an emerging market like Mexico, you must guarantee safety conditions to the users so that they feel motivated to interact and share their car, taxi services or bicycle plans. ', 'In Latin America, the economic growth in recent decades has led to a sharp increase in the rate of motorization, which has not been offset by the expansion of road infrastructure. This imbalance is heightened by the fact that during peak hours about half of the vehicles are mobilized with a single passenger, and cars generally move with a low use of installed capacity. Indeed, more than 400 million empty chairs in vehicles moves per day in the region. This allows to explain that the average speed of journeys has been reduced by about 50% over the past three decades in the main cities of the region. As a result, mobility has become a major economic, political and environmental problems, since in a manner harmful impact on productivity, adoption of public management and air quality.Looking ahead, this the mobility would worsen in the emerging economies since the planned expansion of the road infrastructure will not achieve the motorization rates significantly stimulate by this 3 causes: i) a sharp increase in global urbanization rates from currently 50% the population inhabiting the cities to 70% by 2030; ii) a significant increase in per capita income and iii) an acceleration in the transition to single-person households. Knowing that the problem will increase and that emerging countries are increasing the connectivity to internet and the access to smartphones, from Wheels we believe that there is a lot of potential out there to be reached.However we believe that technological products like Wheels will change dramatically the industry and will change the experience of the commuters.

"BUSSI","The van sharing platform for commute. We create crowdsourced routes, to build reliable on-demand transportation.","[4425, 'A year Ago in August 2014 I decided to join Mexico city and its entrepreneurial environment. Working in an innovation technology center (CTIN) and spending the rest of my day in communities for programmers and hackers (as DEV.F). trying to figure out a pain that most of people suffer and it’s funny because being in this city for 6 months is easy to think as normal spending 2 to 3 hours in transportation for join the office if you use a car, near to 1.5 to 2 hours in public transportation that is not comfortable, secure or even safe. That’s when I realize the pain I was looking for was there “A lack of quality in public transportation service over Latin America (not just Mexico)”. Transportation should be easy, affordable, comfortable, trustworthy, safe and customer first. That’s how the whole idea of combining on demand routes with Van sharing comes up.  ', 'Bussi is a transportation network that gives the possibility to transport groups in a Van, linking people with same routes. we make dynamic routes based on traffic behavior and people destination. Through a platform that gives unique user experience to people who wants to move between hard dense urban points to jobs and principal places in main cities with a mobile app. Our goal is to give an affordable cost service atmosphere with help crowdsourcing and on demand service. ', 'First we create a website where people share where they want to go, which days and what time. Then we make a city heat map and start to propose where the route should exist, the most voted route is the one officially opened. Finally the route is integrated to a very simple mobile application where users can see the Van in turn, check schedule and reserve a seat. ', 'There are so many challenges in starting a product, first and one of the most importants is Team. Bussi needs the right team right now we are a small group in deliver what people wants. we are probably not complete yet but we are still working on it.Second thing is convincing Van owners to try Bussi model, is a hard task we are accomplishing step by step, also we need to have user demand and making growth so both Van owners and users might be satisfied. This is probably a very common challenge in two sided markets.Third is cultural shock, most of people in cities like mexico city are custom to own a car but carpooling or van sharing is something they don’t understand at first, as well people thinks spending 2 to 3 hours in transportations services that lacks quality and safety. So comming with a solution that changes the game in order to penetrate these markets takes a while. ', 'Since very beginning Bussi has been well accepted for must of people, which make us strongly believe we are in the right path to something interesting. Also we have been present in important events like web summit 2014 in dublin.  Back in Mexico we have been part of Posible 2015 an event for entrepreneurs where we also provide a transportation service for more than 150 people. And currently we are working with dev.f in Mexico city to transport around 120 group of people. And now we have more than 450  active users in the last 3 months.

The key for us is traveling with our customers, see what they care for and keep going with what is important. everything else is a distraction. for very specific points, safety and economy is what most of our users care more. Also in case of b2b model, the way to organize events to move big groups of people is what matters. ', 'We are currently serving users with a couple of routes, with a very small mvp. To scale is necessary to improve our application, the way people join and ask for a route which also means to have more Van owners and reduce cost.

"BANANA viva Yilan","provide better driving experience by an android app","[5955, 'For many Yilan residents, the easiest and the quickest way to travel to Taipei and other parts of Taiwan is via Freeway No.5 and through Hsuehshan Tunnel. But the huge demand for the four-lane highway has resulted in heavy congestion, especially on the weekends. For a quicker, safer way home for all Yilan people, we propose a different toll collection system based on the current traveling speeds on different segments of the highway, the slower the speed, the higher the toll rates, thus encouraging drivers to travel through alternative routes when the highway gets too crowded. When the speed on the highway falls below 30km/hr, we set up the toll rate to be as high as 12 times of the original! We believe this system can effectively reduce the amount of vehicles entering the highway whenever a congestion occurs, thus raising the overall travel speed on the highway. ', 'We strive to come up with a solution that\'s not only feasible in theory, but also functions well in real life, so constructing an app for all android system users has always been our main goal in the project. After analyzing the traveler needs, we developed this solution app called ""UWay"". the The user can install UWay on their mobile phones and look for the traffic information of Freeway No.5 anywhere, anytime. Besides highway information, we also provide other traffic website links and traveling information of Yilan. The UWay app has six main functions:Road Condition InquiryHere, the app shows the synchronized traveling speed of six segment on Freeway No.5. The exact speed in km/hr is provided, with corresponding traffic status ""smooth"", ""average"", ""congested"".Travel Time EstimationThe traveling time in each of the six segments is provided. The user can add up the total travel time based on the sections he/she will travel by clicking on the ""checkbox""s of each segment.  Travel Cost EstimationThis function pre-calculate the travel fees on the six segments of freeway NO.5 according to the traffic fluctuation. We set the base toll rate at 1.2NTD/km, and the rate varies with the travel speed. The different rates are shown in the following: Travel speed  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Number of times of the original rateover 70km/hr \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0           X160~70km/hr \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0             X250~60km/hr \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0             X340~50km/hr \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0             X530~40km/hr \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0             X7below 30km/hr \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0         X12The system can also add up the total cost depending on the sections designated by on the user.Other LinksThis part of the app provides the links of other websites containing traffic information all over Taiwan. This may be very useful if the driver decides to take alternative routes to Yilan.Travel InformationThis link will direct the user to the Yilan official tourism website, providing local transit information and other upcoming tourist events.Incidents reportThis is a feedback function for travelers to instantly report back to the system on the current traffic status or road incidents.For further details please check out our demo video.How We built itWe divide our team into two groups responsible for programming and promotion video editing/web page managing.The app: developed by MIT app inventor 2.Travel speed data: Government database.App icon, menu icons: created through Illustrator and Photoshop.Animation: created by Photoshop with timeline function. App demonstration: operated on an android phone.Post-production: Power Director 14.Challenges I ran intoAfter we decide to reduce congestion traffic flow by raising the section toll rate, the first challenge we encountered is to determine the travel speed interval and the corresponding toll charge( how high should the charge get?). It took us a lot of discussion to finally set a 10km/hr interval and an increasing 2,3,5,7,12 times toll rates. Based on personal experiences, we all agree that the current toll fee is too low to force travelers to take different routes. A maximum 12 times of the original rate should be enough to compel most divers to take other roads.The second big problem is the data source. We encounter difficulties trying to directly download the instant speed data from the National Freeway Bureau website, so instead we focus on the downloadable Freeway No.5 traffic data of April, May June of this year(2015). We analyse the data provided by 157 cameras over the three month period first by removing the false/unreasonable data and then averaging the data during the same hour of every day, and finally locating the cameras closest to the current toll gates and use their data as reference speeds. Overall, it was a very time-consuming process due to the large amount of data.Accomplishments that I\'m proud ofAs a group as students, we\'re very proud of the fact that we created the ""UWay"" app all by ourselves!

"Kickback","Effortless, fire-and-forget Amazon refunds when prices change","[3144, 'Amazon has a policy stating that if a product you buy from them has a lower price within a week of your purchase, you are entitled to a refund of the difference. Unfortunately, many aren\'t aware of this policy, and even if they are, it goes unused as it\'s a real hassle to do all the required legwork.Kickback is something that people could and should actually use.  A few days before LA Hacks, I bought a scooter. Just yesterday, the price dropped $10. Because the application hadn\'t yet been built, I had to go through the ""traditional"" process of verifying what I\'d paid, checking the new price, finding the dates to see if I was eligible, and finally the tedious task of contacting Amazon. This experience made me realize how needed this product was.Kickback has literally no downsides to the consumer, and offers huge potential upsides.How it WorksUsers log in through Google in our mobile application (or soon via a webapp), which also serves as a beautiful list of pending and successful refunds. We check your Gmail Inbox for new Amazon orders, and watch for fluctuations in price. If something drops (monitored via Amazon\'s Product Advertising API), not only do we recognize that you\'re owed a refund, but we also send an email on your behalf (from your account using the Gmail REST API) to Amazon, requesting that the difference be refunded to you.Your only interaction with Kickback will be to sign up once, and then receive push notifications whenever we\'ve saved you money.AccomplishmentsWe\'re pretty happy to have made a simple way to passively take advantage of a great policy that you may not have known existed. In terms of technical achievements, we were able to build a relatively scalable MVP in a short amount of time; we organized worker execution with simple in-memory schedulers that could probably handle hundreds or thousands of users as is.We also made a really pretty app.What\'s next for KickbackThis service could be very easily scaled; as more and more people automatically monitor products and get refunds, request overhead goes down due to overlap.

"EDDI - ElectroDialysis Desalinator for Irrigation","Removing the salt effects of drought catastrophes. One ion at a time.","[6442, ""When we first joined the hackathon, we began by researching the various large-scale changes that happen during a drought crisis and how they affect the humans and ecosystems that are susceptible to changes in water abundance. We began with California but wanted to keep an open mind about how this may apply to other parts of the world where drought is an issue. We quickly found that drought caused far more changes than just a simple shortage of water: it was responsible for an increased salinity in groundwater and quicker soil runoff rates, meaning the water that is applied to the soil doesn't stay put. This poses a major issue for farmers who have to resort to overwatering, which becomes increasingly expensive, and less efficient with a decreasing water supply. Additionally, farmers see a decrease in crop yield when their plants are in a saltier soil. "", ""We decided to give farmers another option: remove the salt before they irrigate. With this option, farmers can use electricity to separate the salt from their water, allowing them to use only the water that they need to grow their crops at the maximum yield they can achieve.In short, we built a desalinator for individuals, and it's called EDDI. EDDI is an appliance. Its size makes it perfect for smaller farms, and it connects into existing utilities. EDDI is scalable. Simply add more layers and voltage, or chain two devices together and you can increase your desalting capacity.EDDI is intelligent. You can control it and monitor it from any internet-connected device in the world. With the EDDI web application, you can easily visualize your water's salinity, and how much salt is being removed. You can even download a spreadsheet to analyze your groundwater and plan for your next year. "", ""We used a technology called Electrodialysis, where an electric field is used to separate salt ions from neutral water. This technology uses a series of water channels separated by ion exchange membranes which allow only a certain kind of ion to pass through them. We designed and built our own stack of these channels and membranes as well as all of the plumbing and circuitry that goes into controlling the flow of water. We also built circuits for introducing the electric field into the desalination stack, and switching the polarity of the stack in order to prolong the device's lifetime. We also integrated salinity and flow sensors to detect the state of the device.The Artik acted as the brains and communicator for our device. We utilized almost every GPIO pin of the Artik (it has a lot!). We used a C program with unix sockets to monitor the sensor readings, and we used Node.js to control the circuitry. We used Firebase to store and read our sensor readings and user settings in real time. We designed and built a custom web application for the EDDI. The application is entirely a frontend app made with React.js. The app is designed for ergonomic use and ease of understanding. We've provided an easy way for farmers to visualize and understand water salinity, which is not an immediately intuitive idea to grasp. "", 'As with all hardware projects, what we built took a much longer time than we anticipated. We ran into several roadblocks along the way in all parts of the process.During circuit building, we were just learning how to use transistors, so we tried many circuit designs and blew many transistors before we were able to use them correctly. During the mechanical design, our biggest difficulty was preventing the device from leaking. There were many points where we had to drastically change our design in order to prevent leakage. We also had difficulty in figuring out how to cut the materials, but eventually found a few methods that worked really well. ', ""We didn't electrocute ourselves!But seriously, we are all so proud that we were able to pull all of our individual contributions together and make a device that works the way we set out to make it work in a very limited amount of time.

"APP+Website台灣雪隧疏流","We build a real time and potential software to help both residents and official to reduce and control car flow. ","[8899, '   According to ""Impact analysis of transportation capability by speed limit in xueshan tunnel"",the loading capacity in hsuehshan tunnel is 2400 car numbers per hour, but now it often over 5000 car numbers per hour. The car flow in highway greatly exceed the capacity, which cause serious traffic jam. To solve this problem, there are two aspects that we can do. First, reduce the car flow in traffic. Second, control the traffic flow in hsuehshan tunnel. The detailed information is as followed.1. Reduce car flow   In traffic transport industry, modal switching is a great way to decrease traffic flow. However, there are several disadvantages to ban users from these methods. For example, it is too inconvinient. Users have to search buses, trains and all kinds of public transport ways and they even have to find out how they move whey they are in Ilan. The result is they just give up and drive their own cars. Besides, people don\'t know what they get if they switch other modals, such as, how much time or money they can save. This is a huge problem because bus can afford 5 times of people compared with private cars. To sum up, we want to be a platform that resolve inconvinent problems. We will collect all kinds of information they need and provide some discounts to add incentives. These can encourage people use public transports system and alternative ways to reduce car flows.2. Control car flow in highway   According to  ”Franks Self-organized lane formation and optimized traffic flow in army ants,” if the car numbers per hour exceed 3000, the traffic jam will naturaly happen. We have to control the car flow to prevent natural traffic jam. Reservation system is a good way to control and estimate the car flow for concerned authorities to make further decisions. We can distribute the flow and warn people the expected jam. If we accumulate enough data, we can even give more information to residents. Thus, we want to distribute the flow into reserved lane and normal lane in some serious times like holidays or weekend. Buses and people who reserve on our app can drive on this lane (like high occupancy vehicle lane). Peolpe who want to save time and don\'t follow the rules drive on reserved lane. We will punish them with the help of eTag and License Plate Recognition System.    In conclusion, our idea is using carrot and stich approaches. On one hand, we encourage and make it easier for residents to use public transport ways. On the other hand, we strictly control flow on highway and give severe punishment who want to save time and break the rules. These income can use for subsidy of local residents. ', ""We are a software that are useful for both people transports between Taipei and Yilan and concerned authorities. For people transports between Taipei and Yilan, they can easily grab needed information and compare all ways in our app. For example, they can see which way is faster and cheaper now. Besides, we even provide discounts and booking system in our software. We can give some incentives to seduce them using public transport system. If they want to take the bus, they can book it immediately; if they decide to drive, they can reserve for reserved lane. They can use our services with app and website anytime anywhere.   For concerned authorities, we are a real time supervisory control system. We can collect how many people book for reserved lane and they can make further modification. For instances, if they know around 2000 cars will influx into the system, they can distribute the lane or even suggest some users set off earlier with our serivce. They can also combine it with eTag and  License Plate Recognition System to get some important parameters or charge higher with these users. We can control it better but not like now depend on police officiers' instinction.In conclusion, we are a two-way solutions for users and officiers. There will be a synergy effect if we can connect users and officiers with our services.   "", 'There are three stages we do.   First, data collection, including Field research, collection of scientific papers and so on. We visit Ilan to observe the problem for over 5 times. Besides, we interview 2 professors who know transportation information industry throughly and read over 20 papers and articles.   Second, policy development. We discuss for over 10 solutions like lower interval, combination with OpenXC and so on. We discuss with more than 10 local residents to make sure find out a great solution.    Third, software construction. We write a ""real time"" app and website. In front-end, we first draw manuscripts and discuss UI/UX for 2 weeks. In the back-end, we host a server in Amazon, and run a NoSQL database.  We build a real time connection with web socket that can change information immediately when the database change. We also developed a web crawler to crawl information from official websites.  ', 'The largest challenge we met is how to apply theory into real world. We are students from transportation management and chemical engineering and have some experences in software development. We have to figure out the problem first and apply what we learn in class to solve the problem. It s really a great challenge because real world is not that easy. For example, we want to apply transport formula to calculate capacity. However, the turbulent system do not follow the parameters. When we personally observe in the highway, we found that many parameters are wrong in real case. We concurred a hard time to find out a solution with support of theory.    ', "" We really involved into this project and challenge ourselves. In order to solve this complex problem, we not only investigate it from several aspects like transportation management, policy, chemical engineering, software and psychology, we also run through almosot the whole process of a product's develpment. For example, although we study chemical engineering, we tried to use the knowledge of fluid mechanics into solving this complicated traffic flow problem. We thing out of the box and solve the problem with Interdisciplinary cooperation. Most important of all, as a resident in Luodong, we can solve our own issues and help the society is a great honor! "", ' First, we learn that to solve a huge problem, we have to combine all kinds of professions. Only with cross-border cooperation, we will earn the opportunity to deal with tough issues. This project encourage us to learn more and build our professions to help the world be a better place with our strong abilities. Second, of course, we realize more about Hsuehshan Tunnel and Ilan. We are more connected with our mother land. Besides, scold is easier than construction. We should not scold the government or others because it is really difficult to construct a good policy or solution.  ', 'The logic will not change. Reduce or control the car flow in highway. First, we think that goverment should have a stronger execution. For example, raise the road toll is an effective solution but goverment do not choose this because afraid of lossing the vote. For another example, high occupancy or reserved vehicle lane is also a great solution that many cities use. I think the goverment should be bold! Second, if talk about help with technology. We believe, combination of wisdom mobile system and big data are the future. For example, interval is a really critical key point in solving traffic jam, if intelligent system can automatically control interval between cars, the problem will greatly solved. For another example, with the help of big data, we can predict the car flow and make furthr decisions like distribute car drivers into several differnt times. Last but not least, we think local goverment should do more about local public transport system, many people drive their own cars but not buses because they think it is too inconvinent in Yilan.

"FeelsChat","Twitch chat sentiment analysis for streamers","[5261, 'I have been wanting to get my feet wet with extensions for a while and this was a really fun experience. I thought it would be fun to try to build an at-a-glance twitch chat analysis tool for streamers and viewers alike to see the general mood of a chat. ', ""In essence the application is a chat monitor that performs analysis using some javascript and the AWS Comprehend NLP engine. The once the streamer has the extension open, it will begin to read chat, submitting 2 minutes for processing. Once results are received, the extension will show:Sentiment AnalysisUsing Comprehend, the overall sentiment of the last 2 minutes of chat. The UI shows an emoji consistent with the chat sentiment and some text on the sentiment return. As a note, emojis are excluded from analysis as they may skew the results. Under the simple at a glance sentiment there is a small line graph showing the sentiment of the session in relation of positive sentiment score, the higher the point, the more positive the chat was, this can be expanded in future iterations.Profanity PercentageThis card will show the simple percentage of lines that contained profanity. Again, emotes are excluded from this list to avoid skew. Unlike sentiment analysis this is a running percentage for the session. The anaysis is a regex filter that looks for common 'bad words' and makes the occurrence per line. The measurement is the percentage of chat messages containing at least one bad word.Repeated LinesThis simple comparison is also a running percentage of the number of repeated lines in a segment. Emotes excluded again this is a very simple text comparison. In future iterations I would hope to be able to take advantage of a better (and cheaper :)) text analysis tool to better compare text lines for similarity.Emote SpamThis simple calculation shows the percentage of chat lines that were emote only and contained more than one emote. No hard calculations here as I am able to grab the emote tags to determine if emotes are present and how many and this becomes my counter. "", ""The front end of the extension is built using react. There are 2 main views for the application, the broadcaster's live dashboard and the panel portion of the channel page. On the dashboard the view will execute the polling of the broadcaster's chat and will submit collected chat lines every 2 minutes. The analysis of the chat is centralized to a lambda endpoint that is hit with a POST request. This endpoint will first verify the JWT of the caller and then break off into the 3 major analysis threads. The sentiment analysis is an API call to Amazon Comprehend with an array of chat lines with emotes redacted. Additionally, there are 2 node functions that will complete the analysis for profanity and repeated lines. Once all 3 have completed, the lambda will broadcast a pub/sub message to all connected clients. Once the clients receive the messages, they will update the UI to reflect the information. Another note is that the dashboard will persist the information for the session, meaning if a client comes into the stream late, they will still receive the most recent information, thus keeping all clients in sync. The analysis data points are also kept in DynamoDB for future analysis and trending tools for streamers.  "", 'Getting up and running with the developer rig was somewhat challenging as this was my first foray into the tool. After some getting used to, it turned out to be a great resource. I had worked with Lambda and AWS quite a bit in the past but working with the comprehend API was another learning experience with this project. The biggest challenges I ran into were performance at scale. I wanted to make sure my pack size and response sizes were small so this could scale up. I made some major architectural adjustments to account for performance as well as some potential issues with pub/sub limitations.  ', ""In all honesty just having an extension that is functional and does remotely what I set out to do is something I am very proud of. This was a 'nights and weekends' project for me and I loved working on it and learning about extension development. "", ""I learned a ton about twitch extensions in general as well as some of the inner workings of amazon machine learning APIs. I learned about the twitch API and how twitch's JWT validation works. There was also a good amount of performance tuning and webpack config fun that was a good experience.  "", 'In the short term I would like to expand some of the available information including potential new measures of chat. As mentioned earlier, I would like to expand the text matching capability as well as to add some information around key words and phrases. Finally, trending over time is something I am very keen to expand.

"Chat Translator","Open up your stream to a global audience and break down language barriers with real-time translated chat for viewers!","[7030, ""Chat Translator started out as one of the many open-source Twitch-integrated projects I build live on stream with viewers at the Coding Cafe as Instafluff because I had viewers from all over the world that could speak Czech, Spanish, Dutch, German, and even Japanese but were limited to chatting in English. We created ChatTranslator the Chatbot and turned it into a global Twitch bot and it currently resides in 112 different channels and has translated more than 47 million characters since September 2018. I wanted to take the lessons learned from the chatbot and make it much more natural and integrated with less chat-spam for my community and others as well, and Twitch extensions were a perfect way for me to make it happen.DevelopmentI am a huge AWS fan and have used many of its services for almost a decade now in my own startups and in consulting for other businesses as well, but if not careful, it can get expensive. Chat Translator is a showcase to how, with the good architecture, AWS can be extremely cost-effective for even the penniest of the penny-pinchers.The Chat Translator extension was built using the Twitch ComfyKit with HTML/CSS/Javascript and its backend was built using NodeJS and ComfyTranslate running on the smallest instance of AWS Lightsail, which is a flat $3.50 / month, and one of these instances using the smart-caching system I built for the translations in combination with the $15 / million characters pricing of AWS Translate APIs should be able to currently handle hundreds of small/low-activity channels, about 20 medium-sized (~50-200 viewer) channels, or one really large channel for a total of less than $20 of overhead per month. With further development of the caching and language-detection system, this operating cost could be even lower. When done right, AWS can really make tight budgets go a long way.Technical ChallengesThere are several significant challenges that Chat Translator overcomes that might not be as obvious at first.Keeping the translation API calls budget-friendlyScaling real-time translation of active chat to multiple languages at the same timeHandling Twitch Emotes in the translation processSockets and real-time broadcasting of the translated message to viewersListening to Timeouts/Bans of users and broadcasting the deletion of corresponding messages.Designing to look like the familiar Twitch chat with status and sub badges, username colors, showing emotesAPI Limits & ScalingThe precursor to this extension, the ChatTranslator Chatbot, was already pushing the limits of a 15 million character monthly quota when I began working on the extension for this challenge. I made several improvements to the caching system because this extension may translate to 5 languages at the same time in a single channel so that I could keep the API costs low.The extension connects to the translation server via web sockets, but automatically connecting every viewer to the server will overload it quickly, so I made adjustments to also keep the connection count low and only translate languages as necessary.Twitch Chat QuirksTwitch chat messages are not normal text. It includes emotes represented as reserved keywords and replaced at render-time to images and translation APIs do not understand the emote names and often comes back broken. Chat Translator specially handles the quirks of Twitch chat messages in the translation process in order to preserve the meaning of the original text.Also, when a user is timed-out or banned from a channel, all messages from that user in the chat's history is deleted. Chat Translator is able to listen for these events and react as well.Lastly, in the native Twitch chat, users often have badges reflecting their role in the channel or a special status, such as moderator/bit-cheer/subscriber/etc. including channel-specific badges. Chat Translator's design keeps these badges and other aspects of chat intact so that they do not lose any social value or cause confusion for the user compared to the native chat.Chat Translator's FutureEven with the smart-caching and other systems put in place to help keep the API costs low, it is still a significant operational cost for one person and the bit monetization model doesn't necessarily fit well. After the challenge, I may look into a subscription model to be able to cost-scale the extension, but really the Chat Translator experience makes much more sense directly integrated into Twitch.I believe that Twitch is a truly unique platform because of its social aspect and is strengthened by the connections made on it, which becomes even clearer at events like TwitchCon where people who have only met through the platform can meet in-person for the first time and still celebrate their long-time friendships. This is one of the reasons I love Twitch and believe that Twitch and all of the streamers and users on it would greatly benefit if they could expand their audiences and their social circles beyond language barriers.If this extension were to win the challenge, among other things, I would like to spend the time with Twitch leadership to advocate for its native integration into Twitch before one of its competitors do.Built Withamazon-web-servicesaws-translatecsshtmljavascriptlightsailnode.jsTry it outchattranslator.instafluff.tv      Submitted to    Twitch AWS Extensions ChallengeWinner                Third Place                  Created by  Pizza and coffee fueled the development of this extension.

We chose the “xsalsa20-poly1305"" encryption scheme because it provides great security with fast processing and “TweetNaCl” because it’s a small, auditable high-security cryptographic library.Decryption requires BOTH a master key (stored as a property of a JIRA issue) and individual keys that live on Team Secrets servers.

Initially, we used simple daily emails to gather individual status summaries.As a logical next step we built a prototype responsive web app. Seeing the upcoming Atlassian CodeGeist competition we prepared the web app using AtlasKit and React.

"Penyusuar by  Penyu Ranger"," in order to save sea ecosystem, we cant miss a single part of it. #saveTurtle","[5462, 'Sea turtles demonstrate the ultimate lesson of ecology – that everything is connected.Sea turtles are a part of two vital ecosystems: beaches and marine systems. If sea turtles become extinct, both the marine and beach ecosystems will weaken. And since humans use the ocean as an important source for food and beaches for many kinds of activities, weakness in these ecosystems would have harmful effects on humans.Though sea turtles have been living and thriving in the world’s oceans for 150 million years, they are now in danger of extinction largely because of changes brought about by humans. If we alter the oceans and beaches enough to wipe out sea turtles, will those changes make it difficult for us to survive? And if we choose to do what’s necessary to save sea turtles, might we save our own future? (credit : www.bonaireturtles.org )one of the threats for sea turtles is egg poaching, During the nesting season, hunters comb the beaches looking for nesting females at night . Often, they will wait until the female has deposited her eggs to kill her. Then, they take both the eggs and meat. unfortunately the number of egg poaching are increasing every year, in Sangalaki, a small Island in Indonesia, this case increased by 120% compared to 2013. a local intitute, Yayasan Penyu Laut Indonesia (YPLI) said that almost 1200 egg are stolen by poacher per month in Pasemut Island during a nesting season.Sea turtles have played vital roles in maintaining the health of the world’s oceans for more than 150 million years. These roles range from maintaining productive coral reef ecosystems to transporting essential nutrients from the oceans to beaches and coastal dunes.this case successfully made our heart sink, so we hope this little tool we made can help out to ensuring sustainability of sea turtle\'s life. It is the right time for us to protect sea turtles and rebuild their populations to healthy levels as a vital step in ensuring healthy and resilient oceans for the future.The Problem, and The Solution we offerEgg Poaching is one of the major causes of Sea turtle Extinction. Since it happened a lot in Indonesia, then it become our responsibility to stop it. as a Computer Science student, we believe that by creating a Tool  and a System that could Initialize and start a Crowd/community based movement to protect Turtle\'s egg from poaching can do a little help to prevent Sea Turtle from Extinction.How it worksThis Penyu Ranger (Sea Turtle Ranger) Project consist of the tool, and an android app. we called the tool as ""Penyusuar"" (inspired from Mercusuar, an Indonesian Language for Lighthouse) made of Raspberry pi, a proper web cam and PIR sensor. this tool was built to help Rangers (a name we gave to those who volunteered as turtle conserver) protect eggs from poacher, it can detect if there are threats around the nest of turtle\'s egg. we divided the threats into three conditions, condition one, if there\'s predator(animal) around the nest Penyusuar will play a dog-barking sound to drive away the predator. condition two, if there\'s human around the nest our tool will define them as a threat or non-threat, if they\'re considered as a non-threat our tool will only detect their faces and upload it to our dropbox. and condition three if Penyusuar define the human as a real threat, if they approaching the nest and stay there for a certain distance and amount of time our tool will upload their faces to dropbox (as suspect) and inform all rangers  via SMS so rangers can make sure if there\'s a real threat and take care of it. The android app made to help rangers in order to manage the Penyusuar (located in each turtle nest) it will record the data of the Penyusuar installment including coordinate of the nest and Penyusuar location(automatically added), date of installment, number of eggs on the nest and the species of the turtle. this app will also give a reminder to the rangers on the 60th day since the installment that the egg is about to hatch, so Rangers can move the eggs to the conservatory and perform a semi-natural hatching. within our app rangers can manage Penyusuar record, show it in a Map, view uploaded photos, and also give rangers a statistical information about the number of threats per day shown on a chart.Challenges we ran intohow to help Turtle Conserver against Egg Poachinghow to develop a system that can save turtle from extinction.Accomplishments that I\'m proud ofWe can work in pressure, and also in teamWe can contribute to save turtle from extinctionWhat we learnedWe learned that in order to save sea ecosystem, we cant miss a single part of it.

"Hermes Managed Tire Services - an ioT enabled business","Mileage pricing for Truck Tires supported by ioT. Cents per mile, not $per tire. Increase Fleet productivity.","[10683, ""Internet of Things primarily makes granular information more accessible in real time. However for ioT to take off, we need to show case the technology within a business scenario that can generate a multi-fold return on investment, so that the technology adoption can take off. Business CaseInformation availability in real time alone doesn't add value, or may not add sufficient value to justify the costs and risks associated with an ioT project. To get around this we researched industries and where a combination of an innovative business model that could be executed only through the availability of real time granular data.We looked around for business situations where the availability of granular information can add substantial value. We found that in the after-market automotive care. We further narrowed down the industry to only large trucks and only one part of the truck which is the tire. Tire manufacturers carry very high levels of tire inventory and so does the channel. We analyzed a few companies and found that the inventory holding was in billions. A good example was Good year Tires which had 10.5 Billion sales with over 2.6 Billion in finished goods inventory. The past three years were in the 2.4 to 2.6 billion range as well. The cost of holding inventory in this industry seemed to be between 40% - 55% according to our analysis. This meant that the carrying cost was over a billion dollars and cutting even a small percentage of the inventory will translate into a multi-million dollar cost savings. We created a business model that is based on usage inspired by Amazon Web services. AWS has allowed businesses to pay for IT infrastructure based on their usage. We realized that we could replicate this for a completely  different industry. When customers pay based on usage, their incentives are usually aligned with that of the Managed Service Provider.To align the incentives of the Fleet managers with the managed service provider, we created a usage based billing model for Fleet management. While initially the model will be a simple cents per mile model, more complex measures could be derived that would provide an incentive to the managed services provider to continue lowering the running cost per mile of a truck as long as they get a share of the cost reduction. Solution ArchitectureThe AWS solution architecture is shown below  Business NameHermes is the greek god for roadways and is also considered to be associated with Merchants and Luck. We therefore named the business  Hermes Managed Tire Services  Aligning IncentivesThe Fleet Owner or customer wants to maximize the miles and uptime on his trucks as they are a proxy for his revenue. The managed services provider also has the same metric thus aligning the incentives of the supplier and customer.What it takes to Manage a fleetManaging a fleet of trucks means minimizing the downtime, optimizing the fuel efficiency both of which depend a lot on tires. The business model we are proposing is inspired by the Amazon Web Services but to revolutionize the fleet management and make it a mileage based pricing instead of pricing it based on tires or specific parts.A fleet management operation wouldn't worry about what the condition of tires are and will pay the managed services company on miles traveled.  "", 'A managed service business of this kind would need to maximize the tire usage without affecting the truck downtime. To do this we will use AI based predictive and forecasting Models that predicts when the tire wear is likely to happen and then create a preventive maintenance schedule. The tire wear prediction engine going into the future is built on top of an IOT sensor base which collects data from each truck every second or minute through out the day including mileage, Truck load, Temperature, picture of the road, Tread depth, Tire pressure. Using this granular data, windowed aggregates are computed that include velocity of the truck, acceleration events by level, braking events by level, tread wear per load miles, road condition category from the picture and then computes the expected wear of the tire for the next week and if any of the tires need replacement. This data is then aggregated at the fleet level to calculate the number of tires that require replacement in the coming week, create a maintenance schedule for these trucks and then send the maintenance schedule to the fleet management company. ', 'We designed it in such a way that all of it could be run on AWS with a complete serverless architecture. Since real time data from the trucks was essential for the demo, we built a data generator that simulated a fleet of trucks each with a serial number and initialized them with mileage. To reduce costs of course we only put one truck per customer and had two customers/fleets and initialized the customer data.We  simulated a set of sensors providing the tread depth at sub-millimeter resolution that is inbuilt into every tire. Each tire on the truck has a unique identifier that allowed us to track the mileage, tread wear at the tire level. The tires also had a position indicator to indicate where the tire is installed on the truck (steer wheels need to have more tread than the rear wheels).Accrued Mileage was collected from the truck every second. We used Kinesis Analytics to calculate various features such as average velocity, acceleration, deceleration, braking events, rate of tread wear using rolling and tumbling windows. ', "" Hierarchy of Things Our use case demanded that each truck was a thing which had some sensors as well as there were some things that were connected to the thing in this case tires. Ideally we would have registered the things in a hierarchical fashion but there is no such capability in AWS IOT.To accomodate this challenge we introduced an edge device. We tested a raspberry pi connected to multiple sensors getting the data and persisting on the raspberry pi and then syncing the data. This introduction of edge device was also helpful in building a more tolerant logic that could live with network failures. Issues with Kinesis SQL It took us time to understand the syntax for Kinesis sql. The Kinesis SQL syntax was unlike general SQL and took  a little bit of learning Curve as the Kinesis SQL was case sensitive. Lack of Logging Kinesis SQL  application doesn’t provide any log in Cloud watch. This meant the only means for testing was through trail and error when the application didn't work as expected. Debugging the Parsing Errors Kinesis SQL parsing error messages were not very intuitive so we needed to perform some trial and error on sql queries before figuring it out. API Throttling Errors Within AWS we ran into issues when we tried to analyze images using Rekognition at a high throughput and encountered API throughput exceptions. We requested for throughput increase to ensure that the lambda pre-processor output was working. "", 'The architecture was completely serverless.We used ioT, Kinesis, Lambda and Rekognition extensively. An entire business model managing multiple fleets of trucks and charging for tires by the mile could be scaled up with very limited changes to the design. We did face some issues like API throttling, but we eventually overcame those. ', 'Learnt a lot about tire engineering, available sensors, tire life, factors involved in tire design, tire features for different types of trucks and their usage profile. Played with raspberry pi and tried to integrate data from multiple sensors. Finally for the demo we simply created a simple data generator that could create data coming from all of the tires and at the truck level in a single json which would have ideally come from an edge device residing on the truck. ', 'We ran the numbers and we believe that making the managed services business into an insurance which covers all types of truck maintenance with a truck uptime SLAs would become extremely viable. Once self-driving trucks start hitting the road the variable labor cost is eliminated making the transport miles per truck per day a priority. Currently limited insurance products are available for trucking companies and building these SLA guaranteed insurance products can be hugely profitable for both fleet management and insurance companies.  Currently the Geo-location parameters are not being obtained, but having GPS feed would also give the location of the truck and can be used to integrate weather information. The sensor data in this project generated from the trucks, when combined with the GIS data and fuel consumption can be extremely valuable for tire manufacturers, especially their product engineering team. It will give them the ability to custom design tires for different geographies and load characteristics.  Packaging the data and selling it to manufacturers can also be a valuable revenue source.Extend this information exchange all the way to the manufacturer so that they can manufacture in small batches only the required number of tires and build a connected supply chain. Tire manufacturers have high levels of inventory close to 3 months of inventory and any decrease in inventory can add to the bottom-line. We estimate that if Goodyear Tire was able to reduce their inventory by 10% they would be able to add an additional $105* million dollars to their bottom-line.  We are reaching out tire companies, after market dealers and other industries where usage based billing would be of great value, giving companies the incentive to create products that can improve usage value of the product.* Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GT/balance-sheet?p=GTassuming a carrying cost of 40%.

"Fireflies","We connect people that want food delivered with others already at nearby restaurants using the Alohar Mobile SDK","[6580, 'We are college students that recognize the value of using our time efficiently. We want to empower students to make money while helping their peers. In essence, we see the college campus as a dense network of people who can share resources and time to create a powerful community. Fireflies is our way of redefining the sharing economy on college campuses.  ', 'My friends and I often stay up late at night for exams. We miss out on eating dinner, and after midnight, ordering food is no longer a possibility. At the same time, there are numerous students that are out and about at that time. They pass by restaurants, grocery stores, or even coffee shops. Using the Fireflies app, I can request a meal from Taco Bell or any other local restaurant that does not have its own delivery. The app leverages the Alohar API and notifies someone inside the restaurant, passing by, or just around the corner. With the granular details Alohar provides, our algorithm quickly matches students requesting food with people in the vicinity of that restaurant. Once a match is found, the transaction for the food goes through and Fireflies escrows the money using Braintree. Once my peer brings me the food, the payment is released.  ', 'We built Fireflies with Alohar as a native Android app from scratch for the very first time this August. We aimed to leapfrog off of other existing solutions, and accordingly we integrated several APIs and material design strategies to really vibe with our users. Additionally, we tinkered with delivery ideas in the past and created mockups and surveys to understand user behavior. However we never were able to build a comprehensive solution till now. Until we found Alohar, there was no good way to efficiently track our users and develop a context specific algorithm to enable delivery. We are excited to release this app, complete with designs based off actual user feedback, Alohar integration, and payment systems. ', 'One non-obvious challenge that we ran into while building Fireflies was that our users really didn’t know what to expect when we did user testing. The idea of our app was originally much broader, and we gave users lots of control in the app to to order anything and get it delivered anywhere. (One use case was getting problem sets handed in by peers for their classes). We left a text box for the users to enter what they needed and how much they’d pay. However this was challenging in that the users didn’t know what to put in the text boxes, and if they did, they didn’t know how much to pay. We solved this by eliminating user inputs and giving them a few options with predetermined prices. The app became much smoother, and we noticed a visible improvement in user happiness. This sort of standardization required that we do a lot of work on the backend. When we integrated locations and routes along with pricing, we needed to automate the process to be extremely precise. Alohar provided the information we needed and helped us apply it well within the context of the problem we were trying to solve.  ', ""Getting the most out of the Alohar API is something we are extremely proud of. Alohar provides us with insights on where a user's home location and work location could be. We use that data to extrapolate where the user is going. By taking into consideration several contextual nodes such as time of day, user's past transactions, direction user is heading, and other deliveries being done at that moment, we create optimal matches that saves buyers time and money. In the same way, we optimize routes for deliverers so that they can make the most money possible and complete several deliveries in one go.  What started out as a simple hack ended up providing convenience for people ordering on the go. The app is also a quick and efficient way for other student to make money without going out of their way. Our team is extremely proud of the fact that we can bring people together, empower them to earn, and provide this instant convenience at the tap of a button. We have placed a lot of attention on a seamless user experience. The way we integrated the Alohar API drives our real time, context-based deliveries. Compared to other conventional food delivery applications, we save time and money for the people who order. Likewise, we are extremely proud of nurturing a community where people can mutually benefit from helping one another. In many ways, we are reinventing the traditional supply chain of ordering and delivering. Thanks to Alohar, we were also able to build on existing user behavior rather than forcing users to change what they do and where they go everyday. We are proud of championing Fireflies as a seamless convenience that makes communities stronger.  "", 'As active entrepreneurs, we are constantly hit with an abundance of advice and strategies in creating a product. However, we have found that the only sure way to absorb this advice is to actually go out to the market, talk to our target audience, reflect on our own experiences as potential users, and iterate based on the data we collected. We have obtained insights that we never could have gotten from listening to people speak. We have a persistent, never-give-up attitude and are excited to launch Fireflies equipped with Alohar at college campuses around the country.  ', 'We will launch Fireflies at MIT and Drexel for Fall 2015. As we scale and gain traction we will expand to other schools in Boston and Philadelphia. Our goal is to reach a certain number of daily transactions at each campus we launch at before expanding. We will want to build a rating system and partner with nearby restaurants to make ordering food even more convenient. A long term vision we have for Fireflies is to expand to other communities on a global scale. We see communities that are well connected among neighbors, friends, family members, coworkers, and more. Colleges are a starting point, but we want to keep building, pivoting and tailoring this service to empower different communities across the world.

', 'Our main aim of the project is to control the flow of water using the Samsung Artik board. Since a large amount of water is wasted in terms of sewage, our idea is to use this water filtered in our kitchen garden so that water can be used for growing crops.

Our system also allows to connects multiple users and share their crops over the internet. A marketing system allows the users to sells their crops over the website.

Since we are working on the different parameters of crops, and a large number of crops had alot of parametric data which had to be accounted for. Since we live in India, it hard to go over the authenticity of the facts of California, and this made it quite a time consuming process for us.

So, when we heard about the hackathon, about the amount of data provided by VDOT and Smarter Roads, we as Computer Science students knew it right away, that we can contribute to this cause and decided to come up with a Machine Learning model to predict the number and the type of crashes. ', 'In this design we used 789,914 car crash records to build a performance judging system to analyze the cause of each car crash and predict the number of car crashes on a particular road in future.To do this, we build a classifier and a regressor with machine learning techniques. The classifier was built on the crash records dataset using the Random Forest algorithm.When user, inputs the road features and real time conditions (like weather, time, etc..), 2000 estimators work to evaluate the possible cause of this crash.While the Classifier tell the user about the type of the predicted crash, the Regressor tells the user, the number of predicted  car crashes in the future on a particular road.To build the regressor we cleaned and refined all the datasets and created a new dataset which records the crash and road statics of roads in Virginia. The regressor was built using linear regression algorithms. When user select the road and give the forecast weather in the next month, the regressor will return the expected crash numbers that will possible happen on this road in the near future.Challenges Team ran into:We collected a huge amount of data from the websites and combined several datasets, but still, we were, in need of more data to refine our model. Most of the data was raw data which need to be cleaned. To deal with these problem, we found several open database from the local government and ran statistical analysis on those data and create our own datasets.What Team learnedWe learned an enormous amount about the traffic conditions in the state of Virginia !We learned a lot about data analysis and team working. We are excited about the future of autonomous driving and smarter roads and believe the future of AI and IT techniques in transportation.What’s next?We have built our classification model and regression model and made a web application for it. In the future, if we get more data, we can refine our model and predict more accurate analysis and predictions.

Users can paint unconstrained with 81 colors.","[5950, 'Many artists, professional or amateur, struggle with getting their ideas to the public. Innovative technology such as virtual reality (VR) brings a new set of options to these artists, making the opportunities to express themselves limitless. With VR, the artist’s room becomes his or her canvas where the artist can explore his or her ideas boundless. VR revolutionizes how the artist creates and sees his or her artwork and allows he or she to be himself or herself, respectively.The goal of this project was to develop a VR painting app that creates a comfortable, calming environment to create artwork and improves the quality of life of the user. Specifically, the app targets users who like to draw by improving current technology available to the users. The app includes features such as a 360˚ canvas, an extended color palette and brush selection with activation by a controller, and the option of undoing strokes. The app supports the idea of VR painting by also giving artists who have limited mobility the chance to create works of art once again. VR is a medium where there is an equal chance for all kinds of artists to create art. It is an environment where users can explore their creativity and imagination. This app is designed to give a chance to all who dare to try it. ', 'The 360˚ canvas allows the user to paint anywhere he or she wishes to with just a tap of a button. The user is able to paint anywhere he or she is able to see. This ability unlocks possibilities of painting on the sky and ground, creating no boundaries to stop the user’s creativeness. The app also allows the user to paint unrestricted with the aid of multiple color palettes and brush types otherwise not found in other free commercial available options. With 81 possible colors and the ability to change opacity, depth, or size at the swipe of a button, the user’s options to paint with are limitless. Undoing is a simple feature that requires a press of the app button. One press undoes a part of the stroke whereas holding it erases the whole painting, allowing the user to start on a blank canvas. ', 'The framework of this app is from the github repository android-sdk-googlevr. Code that relates to setting up the VR environment, initiating sensors on a Daydream ready phone, and enabling the controller handler events are all from Google Inc. Additional elements added such as extended color palettes, different brush types (opacity, depth, size), erasing, and saving are created by Varnika Sinha, Sarah Dogar, and Cameron Harvey.Android Studio was the app development environment we chose to work in. We coded the app in Java and C++. ', 'We had some problems with saving. At first, we tried saving it as a 360˚ panorama, but there is no available technology in the phone capable of taking a screenshot in the VR headset without an external camera. Then, we tried saving the vectors created from the strokes in an input file, which would be stored internally on the phone. When the user wishes to access the painting, the file would be read into the app. ', 'We are proud to master such a new technology. The Daydream was released last November, and the developer tools were released this February. In such a short time, we have created our own piece of technology without any help of apis or apks. ', 'Most of the group did not know C++ beforehand. The software used, OpenGL, is coded in C/C++, which required the developers to learn it. We also researched a lot of about the current technology with VR. ', 'An additional feature that could be added in the future is the ability for a user to animate their creations. The animation feature would require the implementation of a frame-by-frame painting process.Another additional feature that could be added is user art-sharing. Users of the app could visit other artists’ galleries and view the paintings they have created. Paint by head tracking allows even users with physical disabilities to experience the joy of painting in the comfortable, calming environment of VR. The option of activating paint options with voice command prompts also opens doors to those who are unable to access or use the Daydream controller. We decided we will also expand this app to other VR headsets and launch this app on Google Play.

"AVGS (Active Vision Guiding System)","Drive with active light guide for best speed and safe distance in tunnel","[9838, 'Hsuehshan Tunnel is the best road for connecting Taipei and Yilan. However there is always traffic jams which increases the driving time on holidays. This proposal focus on eliminating the factor of traffic jam to solve the problem. From our experience of getting stuck in traffic jam, the car speed is usually slow when entering a tunnel, and gets higher and higher when approaching the exit. Why?  There are three main reasons we have concluded as follow: People can’t always keep driving at the same high speed because of the difference speed information showing on the dashboard between different cars. People have difference concepts of safe distance for driving. Improper brake slows down the car speed behind and causes the chain reaction.That is, if all the drivers can drive at the best speed with a suitable safe distance, the rate of traffic flow in tunnel can be higher. As a result, how to guide drivers respectively to drive at the best speed with an appropriate distance is the main purpose of the proposal.雪山隧道是目前台北與宜蘭往返中，最便捷安全的路線。然而，此路線在假日常常造成堵塞的問題，使得行車時間大為增加。本提案提出一種可行且有效率的方式，根除造成堵塞的因素，解決雪山隧道塞車的問題。從我們自身的塞車經驗觀察到，通常進入雪山隧道時的車速很慢，但漸漸靠近出口時，速度越來越通順。探究其主要原因，是車輛沒有保持最高速度前進、或者不當的剎車動作，造成後方連鎖反應。因此，如能讓所有車輛在安全前提之下，能保持最佳的前進速度，隧道的車流量可以達到最理想的狀況。然而，最困難之處在於每輛車儀表顯示的車速會有落差，加上每位駕駛主觀認為的安全車距皆不同，因此如何導引每位駕駛至最佳的""車速""與""車距""，是本提案最主要的目標。 ', 'Considering the expanding ability of equipment for cars and the adaptability of new technology for drivers, it is not easy to build a new system on cars. For example, it is inconvenience to update old vehicles or make all the drivers learn new technology devices or new APPs. The efficiency will be decrease much if not every driver take part in the system. Considering the compatibility for all the vehicles and drivers, and also the driving environments of tunnels are simpler than those of other road types. We design a simple vision guiding system which is able to be installed in the tunnel. This system can provide clear information to guide all the cars moving at the best speed with appropriate safe distance between vehicles. It is the best solution we think! We call it ""AVGS” (Active Vision Guiding System)考慮到車輛的設備擴充能力，以及駕駛人對於科技方式輔助的適應能力，直接建構在車輛上的控制方法是較為不易的。例如，老舊車輛可能有升級擴充的困難，或者部分駕駛人不習慣使用新的科技配備、手機APP等，若無法使所有駕駛人都參與紓解塞車的系統，效率會大打折扣。考量到車輛與大眾駕駛人的相容性，且隧道相較於普通道路，是單方向、不可隨意變換車道，相對單純的環境，我們提出一種可建構於隧道本身的視覺導引系統，直接在隧道增加一個簡單直覺的駕駛導引方式，讓每位駕駛可自然的參考視覺指示，維持在最佳的車速和車距狀態，我們稱為主動式視覺導引系統""AVGS (Active Vision Guiding System)""。 ', 'First of all, we set sensors along the tunnel. The sensor can be IR, light sensor, radar, supersonic or others which can detect the passing vehicles. Second, we set LED array on the road. Lastly, a host computer calculates the car speed depend on the sensor signals and drives the corresponding LED array. The LED array can be a vision symbol, indicating the drivers respectively and reminding them of making some adjustments if they need.The LED indication will move with vehicles and change types depend on the driving condition: Green arrow - You are moving at the best speed (90~100km/h) with an appropriate safe distance (E.G.30~50m) range. Twinkle Green arrow – The speed is too slow, please speed up. Red arrow – The speed is too high, or safe distance is too short, please slow down.PS: the ideal speed and safe distance range can be modified by control center.首先，將感測器(可以是雷射/IR/磁感/光敏電阻/超音波...)裝設於隧道沿線中，藉以偵測移動的車輛。其次，於路面中間沿線鋪設LED符號，最後，利用上位的電腦或PLC裝置，根據回授訊號，即時推算出每台車輛的速度與距離，並驅動對應的LED陣列。LED陣列為一個視覺指示符號，並且各別地指引駕駛，若駕駛行為需要做調整時給予提醒。這些LED將會隨著車輛移動，並根據不同的駕駛行為給予不同指示:車輛在最佳移動時速(如90~100km/h)與車距範圍(如30~50m)內，保持恆亮綠色箭頭。若車速過慢，綠色箭頭會持續閃爍提醒駕駛人加速，直到正確車速後恢復恆亮綠色箭頭。若車距過近或超速，箭頭顏色會變成紅色閃爍提醒修正，直到正確車速後恢復恆亮綠色箭頭。PS:行控中心可依照當下路況動態調整各種參數範圍。 ', 'Since installing the system in tunnel will use lots of sensors and LEDs, it is an important consideration to decrease the cost with reasonable effectiveness. At first, we have evaluated and tried various kinds of sensor, some cost high and some need more time to develop. Lastly, we think the photo sensor is a relatively low-cost and good functionality choice. In practical application, the response time of sensor must be considered to be able to precisely detect the car speed which is over 100km/hr. Because of the large amount of LEDs, it is necessary to select reliable drivers to keep the constant lamination and stable. Moreover, the system has to deal with a lot of information of moving cars, so the hardware core needs good ability of parallel computing such as CUDA. It is also a good way to use multi control units to handle some information respectively, and the host computer or control center will communicate with these control units to monitor the whole tunnel. 因需鋪設許多感應器與LED，如何降低成本又能達到效用是很重要的考量點。起初，我們評估、嘗試了很多種不同的感測器，不是成本高就是開發時程較長，最後我們實測發現，光感測器的方式是相對成本較低，但又保有功能性的好方案。實際裝設時感應器的種類選擇很重要，反應時間需考慮近百公里的車速。由於隧道中的LED數量龐大，硬體需要搭配可靠的驅動器，以維持恆定亮度，並提升穩定度。此外，因為須同時處理大量車輛移動的資訊，核心控制硬體需要較強的平行運算能力，可使用CUDA架構，或者使用多個區域控制核心進行運算，最上位的監控電腦或行控中心蒐集所有資訊後，再進行全隧道的監控。 ', ""It is a very simple and clear way (vision guiding system) to solve the traffic jam problem in the tunnel. 這是一個非常單純且簡潔的方案(視覺導引)解決隧道內塞車的原因。The system can be built in tunnel directly, so it's compatible with all vehicles and drivers. No need to learn or update any equipment. 系統直接建構於隧道本身，設計與運作環境單純，不需要駕駛學習操作且通用於所有車輛。Provide sufficient messages to each car, minimize the factor of traffic jams. 針對個別車輛的問題給予個別指示，將塞車的可能因子降到最低程度。We have designed the software in C, and the control logic is able to be transplanted to larger real system in tunnel with little modification. 我們用C完成了軟體設計，控制邏輯僅需部分微調，是可以移植到真實的隧道系統中。 "", ""To find out the effectiveness of the system installing in tunnel, we have driven   to the tunnel many times. We believe the LED icon should be placed on a noticeable position without distracting the drivers. The best location is the front ground of driver. That can make driver not only concentrate on the driving situation but also notice the LED icon. 為了得知系統放置於隧道中的效果，多次開車進入隧道，我們認為視覺導引圖示出現的位置需要在明顯但不容易使駕駛分心的視線方向，最佳位置為正前方稍遠地面，讓駕駛在專注前方車輛與路況時同時可以感知到提醒。The type of LED icon was discussed and modified several times to make drivers understand quickly and easily. 視覺提醒的種類，經過多次討論將數量降到最少變化且使用清晰易懂的設計。There are many types of sensors, considering the cost, response time and developing time after some tests, finally we choose the best solution so far - photo sensor. The photo sensors can be applied in real tunnels. 感測器的種類繁多，經過多方嘗試後，考量到成本、反應時間、開發時程等等因素，選擇目前最佳的方案-光感測器!此感測器可實際應用於真實隧道中。What's nextDifferent types of vehicle would activate different numbers of sensors, the software have to take it into consideration. 不同車種的長度將會遮蔽不同數量的感應器，背後程式需要可以判斷差異There are lots of dynamic data updating at the same time, so the reliability verification of software and hardware design is required. 實際隧道內會同時產生大量動態數據，軟硬體設計與運作可靠度需要驗證How to transplant the prototype to the real application in tunnel? A PLC or an industrial computer can be used as the control center instead of the ARM microprocessor. By using communication way like RS485 or Ethernet, the control center controls the LED drivers and local control units which sense the sensor signal and calculate the car speed. 未來將如何移植原型系統至隧道的應用之中呢? 可以使用可程式邏輯控制器或工業電腦取代原型中的ARM微處理器。藉由通訊如RS485或者Ethernet的方式，行控中心控制LED驅動器以及下位的控制單元，這些控制單元將各自處理部分的感測器訊號並計算車速。In the future, the AVGS system can be implemented with big data based on the traffic information over the years. According to the current time, car quantity or other factors, establish an algorithm to calculate the best traffic flow in the tunnel and give a best car speed command to control center or host computer. That way, the effectiveness of the proposed AVGS can be the best. 未來將可與大數據做結合，由數年來的交通資訊，根據目前的時間、車輛數等各種因子，建立出即時隧道的最佳車流量的演算法，下達最佳的車速命令給行控中心，將可以將系統的效能提至最高For real application, the installing location of LED is flexible depending on the professional study of user interface and difficulties of construction.實際隧道內系統燈號安裝位置可以經由更專業的使用者介面研究與施工可行性判斷後微調。Working sample DemoSince the actual system installed in tunnel will be too large, instead we develop a small prototype system with the same control logic function. We use 15 LED array to arrange red arrows and green arrows. The sensor we choose is photo sensor which is really cheap and effective. Each sensor is put next to each LED arrow, and it will be triggered when the light is covered by the passing car. Besides, we also design hardware including the driving circuit for LED and interface circuit for sensors. The control unit we use is ST Microelectronics STM32F3 discovery board with ARM Cortex-M4 CPU, and it is developed in C language. The system structure is as the following diagram. This prototype can truly accomplish all the functions of this proposal, and also simulate the control center to change the car speed command by using the knob.

"RAMEAR","We can get data out of your computer wirelessly - even if you don't want us to!","[5039, ' ', 'RAMEAR is combination transmitter and receiver designed for transmitting signals outside of standard computer interfaces. The inspiration of RAMEAR comes from the following GSMem paper  presented at USENIX.We have taken a standard Ubuntu PC, and managed to wirelessly transmit data from it - even though the PC has no Ethernet connection, no WiFi and no Bluetooth.This is accomplished by bashing the Data Bus of the computer - the main communication avenue between the RAM and the CPU of the computer. We use a special assembler instruction to transmit 128 bits in parallel to the RAM, bypassing the cache. We repeatedly run this instruction to transmit random data over a period of 500ms, effectively increasing the radiated RF power from the bus substantially.A ‘1’ transmission in our system corresponds to a period of high activity on the Data bus, and a ‘0’ transmission corresponds to average activity. On the receiving end, we calculate the amplitude of the signal and process it [5 stages] to decode the waveform. We developed the transmission system from scratch in order to fit our needs, including both developing noise rejection code ourselves and automatic clock synchronisation. ', ""On the transmission end, we used standard hardware to emulate a wall-gapped-system, potentially inside a secure facility. We wrote some low-profile code in C which hits the data bus at its maximumum frequency - on this computer, approximately 513Mhz [that's 513 million 128-bit transactions per second]. The code has a very low memory footprint [as it writes to the same location continually], and also has a very low CPU footprint - as the memory frequency is much lower than the CPU frequency.On the receiving end, we use a python script to process the RF data from the bladeRF. During the course of the hackathon we developed our own transmission protocol, and our own algorithms for automatic clock resynchronisation and noise rejection. In order to reject noise, we did have to maximise the transmission period, such that our data rate is approximately 2 bits per second. However, for an example use case of transmitting a 512 bit secure key from a remote air-gapped computer, this only takes 4 minutes to transmit, which we consider reasonable. "", 'We get noise from the frequency channel of our RAM. We had to do a lot of signal processing to reconstruct the data we send to our RAM.The main challenges were involved with the RF processing (we had no prior RF experience) and decoding of the signal. We are dealing with extremely noisy data with no synchronising clock, and therefore the decoding algorithm was complex. However, we are comfortable with how it performed at the end - in several tests it managed to transmit 40 bytes consecutively without a single error.   ', 'Actually managing to make it work was a challenge - especially when it came to data decoding. The data decoding automatically resynchronises the clock on high quality pulses, and then relies on this timing when the signal becomes worse in quality. Secondly, the system automatically keeps track of the high and low signal powers, and continually readjusts the thresholds to ensure that a drift in power still remains readable.  ', 'How to use the BladeRFHow to integrate assembler instructions into a C programHow to calculate the power of a I/Q RF signalHow to roll-your-own clock resynchronisation ', 'At another hackathon we would love to increase the power of the system and improve its range. We believe we should be able to achieve substantially greater ranges by incorporating more RF knowledge into the project - using tools such as increasing the gain in hardware.We would also like to hijack the mobile baseband in your phone to pick up these signals automatically - without the need for a Software Defined Radio (SDR) like the BladeRF.

"wake","The alarm that actually gets you up","[3157, ""If you've ever hit the snooze button again and again and again only to realize hours later that you should have been up long ago, then you've felt the pain that we have felt. Driven by the need for an alarm that genuinely got us up, we set out to create wake. The app itself is simple. Instead of tapping or sliding a button to disable it, the user must get out of bed and walk a certain distance away to disable the alarm or vigorously shake the alarm for twenty-seconds. These physical triggers engage the user in a way that alarms have not done in the past. Leveraging the GPS and Accelerometer features of modern smartphones we created wake. Additionally, typical snooze features enable users to form bad habits by continuously snoozing an alarm. Instead, wake provides a unique form of negative reinforcement. Users can choose to enable or disable the snooze feature, but there's a catch. The snooze feature must be linked to the user's bank account, and every snooze donates a pre-set amount of money to an entity of the user's choice, such as a charity or political campaign.How we built itThe application was built in Objective-C for iOS devices. We leveraged iOS’s NotificationCenter, AudioToolbox, AVFoundation, CoreLocation, and CoreMotion frameworks to implement all the features for this application.

Additionally, the UILocalNotifications that we used for the event triggers were uncooperative and sometimes would not fire — so we also built a standard timer to alleviate this issue.Unfortunately, due to the lack of an Objective-C wrapper/library for Plaid, we were unable to complete integrating their payment processing system.Accomplishments that we're proud ofWe were proud of the UI animations, flow, and functionality of the app. We wanted to make the app not only be functional but also to look/feel great.

"MemoryEye","Help those with Alzheimer's remember their loved ones.","[4661, ""The future of tech is accessible, so we wanted to leverage the resources offered by Hack MIT to make our first step towards that direction. Since the hackathon's theme is hack for a reason, we decided to hack for a cause that affected both our team members and many others: the Alzheimer's disease. And with the Alzheimer's awareness month right around the corner (November), we thought that Hack MIT 2019 was the perfect opportunity to build something cool and start a discussion around this disease. "", ""MemoryEye enables the user to easily create a memory by taking pictures of an object or a person that they want to remember, and adding a description of the memory. When the user comes across this person or object again and can't remember exactly who or what they are, they can take a picture of the person or object, and the app will use computer vision to pull up the memory that they recorded earlier so that they can relive that memory and remember again. "", ""Once we had a general idea of the solution to the problem we were trying to solve, we split-up our team into front-end and back-end sub-teams. We then established a list of required goals, as well as a list of reach goals that we worked on for the rest of the weekend. The result was a native IOS app made with Swift on XCode, utilizing Microsoft Azure's Custom Vision API for computer vision functionalities. "", 'We wanted to challenge ourselves by using a new tech stack for HackMIT 2019. For most of us, it was our first time developing a native app for IOS. Therefore, gaining sufficient context on the IOS programming practices was an important challenge for all of us.One specific challenge that we overcame was deciding how we would provide the Custom Vision model with enough pictures for it to be trained properly, without requiring the user to provide an absurd amount of pictures of their memory. Our solution was to require four pictures from the user, then manipulate the images to create new pictures out of them. This not only solves our problem of needing more data, but also increases our data variety to cover different angles, thus creating more robust classifiers.

"Agro Companion","App that allows USA Farmers to visualized their idea crops and also allows information exchange via a social network","[11681, 'As an IT Scientist, I have little knowledge on Agriculture based on Agric Science I did in Secondary School but thisknowledge wasn\'t enough so I started interviewing Farmers,Agricultural Lecturers and Students within my area and In my school on what to do to ensure excellent farming, maximum crop yield and to ensure thatall this information are passed from one generation of Farmer to another without alteration. The average resopnse I got were stated below.1.) If appropriate planning are in place regarding financial Capabilities,production cost,crops yields things will be okay.2.) Testing of soil propertises need to be done to know the crop suitable for a particular Areas.3.) The major problems faced by farmers are mostly drought, weeds and Insect Attacks. If this can be mitigated, then maximum yield can be expected.4.) Most Young Agricultural graduates and Farmers lack interest in Farming because of unavailability of Informations onModern trends in Agriculture. All Professors and all Agricultural Students and graduates in various Universities Points out that If USDA Dataset can be collabrated with Social Network for purpose of Dataset Analysis, Data Visualisation,information Exchange(Just like in Facebook),it will make farming/Agricultural Studies one of the most interesting disciplinein the world. For Instance a Young Graduate trying to setup a Soyabeans Farming can immediately leverage USDA Datasets andcan share his knowledge, ideas or issues with other Users(Farmers) via a social network thus ensuring information propagationthrough an unbroken succession from one generation of Farmer to another. Farmers are ensured that any issues on farming can easily be resolved by leveraging USDA Dataset and by other responses from Farmers from various Farming disciplines within the Social Network.What Inspiration & Interview Lands me into.USDA Dataset is Very Broad though the API Call for each dataset is very simple. Thanks for the USDA Enginneers.From Inspiration above, we all knew that Water(H2O) and Air(O2) are two essential commodities that support human lives.While Human uses Oxygen(O2), plant uses Carbondioxide(CO2) for Photosythesis as can  be expressed mathematically inthe Photosynthetic Equation BelowFrom the Photosynthetic Equation Above, You can Visualize the quantity of Water and Carbon(iv)Oxide needed as a reactant toyield a Product called Sugar.So from this equation, you can understand that water is very essential for plants growths andcrops yield. Consequently, lack of water commonly known as DROUGHT can be disasterous to plants as it can inhibitsphotosynthesis in plants and can lead to little or no crop yield or the plant may even die off due to lack of water.What I builtAn app that allows American Farmers to visualized their idea crops,predicts production cost, knows the favourable state for growing a particullar crop, visualized the amount of water needed(eg. Irrigated Water,Ground Water, Surface Water) and quantity of crops yields in Bushels over time.The app also allows information exchange between Farmers via a social network. The App leverages Irrigation Technology & Water Use (ARMS DATASET 1999-2006).What this App DoesComponents A: USDA Data VisualisationsThe App leverages Irrigation Technology & Water Use (ARMS DATASET 1999-2006). From the USDA Dataset above, we picked uptwo crops (Soyabeans and Corn) so we started with Soyabeans as a case study via the API Call.so the app were able to integrate all Planted Acres, Irrigated Acres, the ground water usage, surface water usage and irrigated water used on the crop(Soyabeans) and amount of products yields(Bushels) per application over time(eg 2006,2002,2000,1999 etc..). This datasets were collected for every statesin United States. All this datasets were dynamically created via API Call to deploy Data Visualization components and statistical graphs were ploted using Bar Charts, Column Charts,Aggregated Area Chart and Pie Chart distribution Analysis over time.With this Graphs Visualization Components, Farmers can be able to Visualized graphs Dataset on each states in USA on crops Yields(eg.Soyabeans) over time(eg year 2006,2002,2000,1999 etc)For instance in Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska etc........Farmer can graphically visualize over time,A.) Amount of surface water used vs Crop Yield(Eg. Soyabeans in Bushel)B.) Amount of Ground Water Used vs Crop Yield(Eg. Soyabeans in Bushel)C.) Amount of Irrigated Water Applied  vs Crop Yield(Eg. Soyabeans in Bushel)D.) Amount of planted Acres etc...From this graph Visualisation statistical Analysis, Farmer can be able to know the quantity of water(Eg.Ground,Surface,Irrigated)needed and amount of crops that can be produce with it with respect to time(Eg. year 2006,2002,2000,1999).For instance in Nebraska state in the year 2006, the average Arms Datasets were as followsGround Water Used: 90.472 Percent of Irrigated Acres.Surface Water Used: 9.528 Percent of Irrigated Acres.Water Used Per Irrigated Acres: 9.715 Per Inches.Irrigated Acres: 2369.147 Per 1,000 Acres.Planted Acres: 5050.109 Per 1,000 Acres.Crop Yield Per Irrgated Acres: 61.98 Pounds(cotton), Bushels(all other crops).All this statistical Data will help Farmers in decision making process like checking production cost, crops yield and Business Profitability The app also provides Dataset Graphs Visualisation Components that allows Farmers to Compare and visualize data at State Levelonthe amount of planted Acres per state, the amount of Water needed(Eg Irrigated, Surface and Ground Water) versus Crop Yield etc per state.This will help USA Farmers to know the States that consumes more water and amount of crop yields(eg. Soyabeans).For instance, graphs data visualisation on state level comparison eg in year 2006, shows that INDIANA consumes highest Groundwater(about 100.00 percent of irrigated acres and crop yields was 40.561 Bushels) whileNEBRASKA consumes lesser Groundwater(90.472 percent of irrigated acres and yield the highest crop in the year about61.98 Bushels)Based on Production Cost,You can see that Nebraska in the year 2006(ARMS DataSets) consumes lesser water and produces thehighest Crop Yields(Eg. Soyabeans) than its counter part state Indiana that consumes the highest water in the same year but produces a lesser Crop Yields.The Inference from this Arms dataset 2006 makes Nebraska one of the best state in USA suitable for Soyabeans Farming both in production cost and crop Yields.Components B: Social Network Integration with 1-to-1 Chat System with Photo Sharing OptionMy Interview with Farmers, Professors and all Agriculttural Students and graduates in various UniversitiesPoints out that If USDA Dataset can be collabrated with Social Network for purpose of Dataset Analysis, Data Visualisation,information Exchange(Just like in Facebook),it will make farming/Agricultural Studies one of the most interesting disciplinein the world. For Instance a Young Graduate trying to setup a Soyabeans Farming can immediately leverage USDA Datasets andcan share his knowledge, ideas or issues with other Users(Farmers) via a social network thus ensuring information propagationthrough an unbroken succession from one generation of Farmer to another. This Social Integration are design to function just like facebook.it will help farmers exchange informations between themselves. Farmers, Agriculturist can be able to Share and post status updates, post photos, post and Share Videos, send like & comments etc. about Agricultural modern trends and for educative puposes. Farmers can be able to send friend request to their fellow Farmers, Makes friends and chat with one another on 1-to-1 chat conversationswith photo sharing options. Users can be able to search Farmers based on their names,email address, phone number and Farmersfarming specialization. For instance if you are looking for a farmer that speacialized on Corn Farming to have a conversationwith him or her, you can just type corn in the search box and all farmers that specialized on corn farming will bepopulated.....If you know how to use facebook, this social integration will be easy for you as everything were implemented using facebookliketechnology and user friendly UI designs.How it WorksJust call up the application and make one time registration. Login to start accessing the app.To visualize USDA Datasets, click on AGRO PRODUCT, select soyabeans as a case study and then navigate. On the landingpage, you can be able to access the USDA Datasets on different states overtime eg(year 2006,2002,2000,1999), If the states you are looking for is  not loaded,Click on LOAD MORE US STATE button to load more state.Every Populated states immediately shows average Planted Acres, ground water used,surface water used, irrigated water appliedand amount of crop yield over time.To be able to visualize datasets statistics of a particular state eg ARKANSAS,NEBRASKA etc... you can click onClick on View State StatisticsTo be able to compare datasets statistics for all states at state level, click on Compare All States flanking each state.Once you are there first select the year eg (2006,2002,2000,1999) that you want to compare and visualized, and the graphsdata will be loaded for each year choosen. For further details reference the demonstration video or email me.For Social integration, everybody is already facebook fans, so just assume yourself to be accessing facebooks where you canpost Status Updates, Post Photos, Post and Share Videos on Farming and Agro-Educations. Can Send Friend request, Makes friends,Like and Comments on every post being Shared, can search and connect to any Farmer in United States. Among all can be ableto Chat with other Farmers in United States on 1-to-1 chat messages with photo sharing option..Challenges I facedSome Datasets has null values when making API Call to USDA ARMS DATASETs. NUll simply means that the value in Undetermined,unknown or Not available. I implore a module on my server backend that converts all null values in the API to zero to make statistical analysis more efficient.Again Building a Social Network with Facebook design with all techonogical components and features to make the app userfriendly and integrating it with USDA DATASETS for Data Analysis and Visualization took much of my time to be precise(32 days)What NextWe will adding other remaining crops and its datasets one after the other via the API call and allows data Visualisation on the fly while ensuringthat all datasets are in place.we need to expand social aspect of the Apps to allow farmers to start creating Farmers Groups, Farmers Page just likein facebook. Eg A farmer can create a group on titled ""Rice Farming"" and other farmers who are interested on Rice farming canfollow up.Comming SoonAndroid Version in less than 14 days. IOS and Windows version can be coded in less than 30 days if there is a need for it. All resources is just set for coding.Technology Upgrade coming soon......1.)

"PedSafety","Every pedestrian's companion","[4333, 'Every year hundreds of pedestrians and cyclists become victims of road accidents. We truly believe that technology can reduce this number very easily and PedSafety aims to do that. PedSafety helps pedestrians in numerous ways and ensures that they obey the traffic rules. It is the perfect companion app for pedestrians.We obtained the inspiration of the idea from two sources:Existing Look Up applicationThe ordered movement of animal groups in nature ', 'To use all the features of this application, Bluetooth beacons need to be installed on the traffic lights. The bluetooth beacons are very economical and can be easily installed on the traffic lights.  When a person with the PedSafety app reaches a traffic intersection, the application can detect the bluetooth beacon. If the person is crossing the road, the application would disable the phone functionality and display a ""Look Up"" overlay on the screen. It helps users to keep their eyes on the road and not on phone while crossing. Once the user reaches the other side of the road, the application detects the other beacon and provides reward points to users for using the zebra crossing.This encourages people to use the zebra crossing and not cross the road on any other points. This application is very useful for the Government authorities as well. The app can be used to send anonymous pedestrian and cyclists traffic information to the authorities. The bluetooth beacons can detect the intersections with high pedestrian density and routes with high cyclist density. These statistics can help authorities take informed decisions and build subways/overbridges and cycle lanes wherever required.The application also includes a floating camera which helps the pedestrians to see the sidewalk in the phones itself while using the phone. This nifty feature ensures pedestrians don\'t collide and avoid pits.  ', 'We started by observing and listing down the problems faced by pedestrians and cyclists. Lack of pedestrian and cycle lanes is one of the biggest issues. We started to build this application with the aim of solving this problem and the problem of pedestrian road accidents.We looked at various existing solutions and found that a very simple solution already exists. It was called Look Up. In our application we added that functionality and various other features.To gather pedestrian and cyclists data, we thought of using bluetooth beacon for higher accuracy. The authorities can also easily program the beacons to send awareness messages to all the pedestrians and cyclists. ', 'We had to come up with a low-cost solution which can effectively solve the problems of the pedestrians and cyclists. We all know that in ordered animal movements, every agent tries to optimise the movement of the team. The existing traffic solutions try to imitate this for humans by ordering their movement. The challenge we had was to gamify the existing system in a way which can ensure that pedestrian and cyclists obey the traffic rules.We believe that the current reward systems can easily be transformed into a redeemable award systems. This would give people more incentive to obey the traffic laws. ', ""We built one nifty feature which allows pedestrians to look ahead on the path while using their phones. We think that it is one nice thing which we built which we have already started using in our everyday lives. What's next for PedSafetyWe have thought of various features which can be integrated in this application in future.

"HN - frenly","Building a friendlier web community with sentiment analysis.","[3454, ""The web is just toxic because you and I can be toxic. The Problem of InternetEveryone hates that the internet can be really mean. Everyone hates the cyberbullies, the keyboard warriors, the irrational haters that contribute to this issue. Yet, everyone can easily become a bully, a hater, a keyboard warrior because people may get angry and act on anger without thinking twice. Hence, everyone is in this vicious cycle of internet toxicity. Creating it, spreading it and hating it all at the same time. As a conclusion, the internet needs to have a sort of measurement, that could not only think twice for us but also help us to think twice. We need a “frenly™” internet.Solutionfrenly™ is a Chrome extension that vows to end the vicious cycle of internet toxicity in the web, by proactively preventing toxicity from spreading and creating. Features as below:1. Read Post / CommentsWhen our backend sentiment analysis engine detects potentially toxic comments in the loaded web page, they will be censored by an overlaying color block. The user may choose to reveal the negative comment at his/her risk.If the page contains too many negative comments, we will request the user to consider to leave the page.By smartly detecting the web content, user can be in a more active position countering internet toxicity. Whatever is spread, can no longer harm. 2. Write Post / CommentsWe introduce a toxicity meter on the comment textbox. Before a comment is being posted, it is sent to our backend sentiment analysis engine to evaluate its polarity.If the polarity goes too negative, the system will pop a window to advise the user to reconsider his/her word choices.By initiating respectful reminding alerts, user can no longer fall easily for the emotional trap. Whatever is toxic, can no longer be created. 3. Post / Comment Wrap-UpA health check summary is provided to the user to assess his/her average negativity and subjectivity of input history.Implementation wise, we pull the active user's comments and posts using Facebook API and Twitter API and feed them into our sentiment analysis engine for evaluation.Tokenization is performed on the user's comments and posts to find out the top 5 most significant words used in each social media platform.By actively studying user’s internet speech, user can learn more about him/herself and cultivate the right mindset.Together with all 3 aspects, we hope to create a lightweight, yet powerful tool to help to build a nicer, friendlier web community.What's Next For frenly™frenly™ is now supported to run on Facebook, Twitter and Youtube. We hope that it could be extended on other social media platforms to continue its effort on combating cyber negativity.frenly™'s backend sentiment analysis engine could be improved to achieve more precise detection on negative and potentially harmful comments.TeamTan Hao HaoGary Lai Jun HongHeng Ming JiBuilt Withcsshtmljavascriptnatural-language-processingpythonsentiment-analysis-onlineTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    Hack&Roll 2019Winner                Top 8                  Created by  Heng Ming JiTan Hao HaoFinal Year Computer Science Student @ NTUGary Lai "", ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['javascript', 'css', 'html', 'python', 'natural-language-processing', 'sentiment-analysis-online']","True","49","['heng0178', 'gudgud96', 'onwardgary']","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/743/244/datas/small.png","False","0"

"Task Tracker","Everything we do is driven by time. Get more out of your time with Task Tracker","[10401, 'Many people suffer from the habit of procrastination which results in them falling behind and losing control of time. They aim to accomplish so much in such little time but fall short in doing so. This problem of procrastination is growing as serious rates, likely due to the introduction of new and improved distractions that are even harder to ignore. In fact, according to Dr. Steel, Phd, a physiologist at the University of Calgary, the population suffering from chronic procrastination increased from 5% to 26% between 1978 and 2007. Also, in a different meta-analysis experiment, Steel found that 80-95% of 2007 college students admitted to procrastination that negatively affected their classwork.  ', 'Task Tracker  is a solution to this problem that aims to attack it from all directions. The app helps users with achieving balance and becoming more productive by showing the user a comparison between how long they expected to spend on each task and how long they actually ended up spending. The app also puts every task into one of five categories, which are also compared for balance. Lastly, Task Tracker sorts the users tasks in the order the user must complete them to be most efficient based on information the user inputs about the task.The user can use this information to become more productive by decreasing the difference between the expected time and real time spent and can also become more balanced by trying to match the amount of total real and expected time put into each category. They will also become more efficient by completing the tasks in the order for most efficiency.  ', 'We built the app using MIT app inventor. This was minor challenge we faced during development of the app was learning the block language that we were unfamiliar to. To learn the language quickly, we spent some time looking through tutorials and creating the sample apps to learn the functions of the app inventor and the basics of how to code. Once we knew these, we began to program our app and used the guess and check method to overcome other programming hurdles.Most of out functions were programmed through complex decision structures that we created through the guess and check method and repetitive testing. An epitome was programming the sort function to work in all cases despite similarities in priority and expected time. We did this by adding multiple tasks with the same and different priority levels and programming the app to repeat the sort method between every 2 consecutive tasks until it is fully organized. The program uses one of our several algorithms, sort using an if...then case structure with variables programmed to change values for every run based on the given index.   ', 'Time constraint: One major challenge was completing the app and all necessary parts for submission prior to the deadline. We heard about the competition and applied late and had less time but solved this issue by splitting up the tasks and working together.MIT App Inventor language: A minor challenge we faced during development of the app was learning the block language that we were unfamiliar to. To learn the language quickly, we spent some time looking through tutorials and creating the sample apps to learn the functions of the app inventor and the basics of how to code. Once we knew these, we began to program our app and used the guess and check method to overcome other programming hurdles.Sorting: When developing the application, the sort function was a problem due to the complexity of the algorithm and the required knowledge of programming. To solve this problem we used the guess and check method. We developed several algorithms, and learned how they processed the information. we finally were able to make the current algorithm for sorting using a if...then case structure with variables programmed to change values for every run based on the given index.  Pie Charts: The last major programming challenge we faced was with the Pie Chart APIs. MIT app inventor does not have a function for charts and diagrams so I had to learn how to program and recreate APIs that I plugged into the show charts section of the Compare pages. These APIs take real time data from the app and convert them to show the information. I had a hard time formatting and setting up these charts but learned through online resources.Scalability: The scalability of the app was a minor setback in the design development process. The app was originally designed for mobile use since we were only able to test with the Samsung Galaxy S4. The text and buttons sizes and placement was based around this device. Towards the end of our process, we began testing using the Lenovo Yoga Tablet. Due to the large variance in size, the app was not able to format properly and we had to rescale everything using percents to match both tablet and mobile devices. ', 'We are proud of the many of our features that we were able to create despite the time constraint and our lack of knowledge of the language when we started the app. One major example are the Pie Chart Apis on the compare pages. For these we learned how to program, format, as well as embed live API charts into a web viewer of the app that could take changing real time variables within the app and use them to compose the charts. As side from the sort function, the update page functioning was also an accomplishment. Since there is no given timer, we programmed the stopwatch on our own and created many split functions to make the app able to add to the time already existent on the app. We also were able to program the app to allow people to stop the timer, take breaks, and then start the timer again and still allow for the time to compile under the actual time of the same task.  ', ""The development of Task Tracker demonstrates our ability to improve learn quickly and apply our knowledge. For the challenge, we had to learn a new language and create many complex functions using it in a small time period. As we developed this app, we experienced the entire software development life cycle. Which is we gathered requirements.  First we had a big picture of what we wanted to develop. Then we brainstormed among this group and with other students and documented what features would be useful in the app. Then we went through the list of features and determined which are feasible and could be developed in the timeline. After this we went into Design mode. Where we designed each page of the app and functionality of each page. How many buttons will be present and what each button would do. We also created sketch of each page to determine the look and feel of the App. Once we have finalized the design it is time to actually build the app. We started with building pages and adding blocks to each page for the intended functionality. Some of the functionality was straight forward and could be coded easily. Some of the functionality like sorting et., needed more research and learning before we could add the code. Once a page is developed and is supposed to be functional, then one of use (other than the person who developed the code) would test that page and document and defects (where the functionality didn't meet the design). Then the developer would go back and fix the code to work correctly. There were several iterations of coding and testing of both page display and code blocks before we could get to the page working exactly as deigned. At the end we tested the overall app end to end making sure that every single page is tested int he entire flow. Now we have an app working as designed.

"Purrpurino","The new way of embracing emotions","[7709, 'We wanted to create a tool that would help parents to educate their children, enhance empathy and reinforce positive values, while having a toy that would not bore kids.We wanted to create the first interactive toy for kids able to display emotions through colors, able to act autonomously or be controlled by parents via a mobile app, in order to help kids in their emotional and social development. We wanted everything to be built using the new wave of the internet of things, and create a toy that kids will see as something more than than a toy, a friend that they will spend the nights with! We had some goals in mind for the development of Purrpurino, which could benefit society in several ways: · It would help parents reinforce good behaviours in their children. Parents can set Purrpurino\'s emotions, and Purrpurino will act depending of that state. For example if the toy is sick it will expect a kid to take care of him, and if it is playful it will expect the kid to play with him. · It would help kids sleep at night, with dim lights that will keep company and help them stop being afraid of the dark! · A system to help parents waking up their kids, gradually increasing Purrpurino\'s led brightness in the morning and using the stepper motor to make the kid wake up with a smile.Purrpurino comes from a combination of different words - Purpurina (Spanish word for glitter), ""Purr"" (like the purring of cats) and the suffix -ino obviously comes from Arduino.  ', 'Purrpurino (purr-pur-ino) is a new plush toy that uses different sensors to interact with a kid, allowing them to learn from emotions and reinforce positive values. The way Purrpurino teaches about emotions is using different lights -  which correspond to different moods that are triggered depending of the actions of the kid. Purrpurino has 7 different states to display emotions: shy, awake, sleep, happy, sick, playful, angry/sad and has a lantern mode. A parent or guardian can modify the mood of Purrpurino through the app to project emotions in Purrpurino.  ', 'We used an Arduino 101 (Genuino 101 here in Europe) as the core brain of Purrpurino, and different sensors of the Grove Starter Kit. Using the Arduino 101 was crucial because it made it easy for us to create an app to communicate an Android app with the board, using the board integrated Bluetooth.The Grove Starter Kit Plus sensor set was a perfect fit as it had the main components that we needed to make Purrpurino come alive: · Light Sensor : To control if it is dark and make Purrpurino go to sleep.· 3 Axis Sensor : To know if Purrpurino is getting dizzy or if he is playing.· Piezo Vibration Sensor : To track if someone is petting Purrpurino. · Stepper Motor : To make the purr effect. And from ""standard"" components not from the grove sensor kit we used :· Push button : as a way to switch on / off lantern mode.· ws2812b 5050 RGB Leds :  to display the emotions and states of Purrpurino through led lights. Instructions of usePurrpurino starts in a shy state where he gets to know his new owner. His cheeks are blushed in this state and he needs to be petted to get used to the new owner. After some caresses, the light of Purrpurino will turn green while purring delightfully as a cat, as that indicates the happy state. Now the functions of Purrpurino can be showed.The new owner can play with Purrpurino, shaking Purrpurino gently to have a good time, but if he gets shaken too much, he will become dizzy. Some petting will fix his dizziness and he will be happy again.A parent or guardian can modify the mood status of Purrpurino through an app designed to do so. This way a parent can reinforce positive behaviours in their children or make them realise of a bad behaviour and teach them not to do so.If Purrpurino get angry, his owner can caress him to make the rage go away.Purrpurino can go to sleep when no light is detected, purring softly for a set of time that will allow the kid to sleep while feeling protected.Purrpurino has a button in his right paw to enable ""lantern mode"" so no matter if he is sleeping you can use it to brighten the room. ', 'We had never created before a connected app using bluetooth with a hardware device and it took some days before we could send data between devices. Plug-and-play hardware are not always easy to set up! We had some trouble with some parts of the hardware, that took us more time that expected to make it work properly. For example, the stepper motor was not working as what it was expected from the documented examples and it was a lot of trial and error to make the piezo vibration sensor to get the petting feeling that we wanted. We had some trouble when we had to fill everything inside the plush toy, as the components are rigid and we were fitting in a soft space, that continuously was being pressed, which led frequently to malfunctions and cable disconnection when we were testing the ""live"" prototype. ', 'We specially love the purr effect that you get when petting Purrpurino, as it reminds us of our cat. We are really proud of having created a working prototype of a toy that could be used to play, educate, and promote good behaviour on kids, but above all we are really proud of having created a toy that our test kids LOVED!  ', 'We have now a greater knowledge of Arduino and how to interact with different sensors, and we have learned how to communicate an Android app with an Arduino 101 board using Bluetooth! We have also learnt that recording videos with kids is really hard and we can barely use some minutes from the hours of footage that we have with them. ', '· Sound : Purrpurino right now is mute, adding sounds to empower emotions and states would be a really nice addon. · Real Time Clock : We want to keep track of time so we can implement new functions, like knowing when Purrpurino should wake up in the morning or start going to sleep autonomously. · In-app options - We want the parents or guardians to be able to set the wake up time or the time that Purrpurino should go to sleep.· Power management : This part needs to be tested carefully as it is really important to have the less possible consumption to make Purrpurino last longer with a simple charge. We want to set Purrpurino in deep sleep mode when he is in the sleep state.  · Rechargeable battery : We need a way to charge Purrpurino easily and if possible without having to open the toy. · More states and sensors : We will need to implement more ways to interact with Purrpurino, creating more states and adding more sensors to different parts of his body. · Data, metrics and graphs : We can get some sleep patterns and get the analytics of how a kid uses Purrpurino to check data like when is the toy most used, if the kid uses it at night among other things!

"Save A Life","Save a Life is an application that teaches you CPR in a modern way, and empowers you to help save someone’s life!","[6433, '70% of Cardiac Arrest happens outside of the hospital. The first few minutes are critical to organ function - it is imperative that the patient receives immediate assistance, which can mean the difference between life and death. We believe everyone in the world deserves access to the best CPR education available. Effective CPR can double the chances of survival and preserve vital brain function. ', ""We teach CPR in a modern, interactive way. We train people on how to administer CPR by providing conversation geared education on both a messenger and a web application platform. Our application teaches CPR for infants, children, and adults using varied learning tools such as speech, gifs, and language translation in order to be accessible to all as well as to keep users engaged, whatever their learning style may be. Within the app, users can leave comments, share the lessons they’ve learned, and use the social plugin to spread the message to Facebook's timeline. Our web apps can also show locations of Automated External Defibrillators within the U.S., and there's more to come. With modern Facebook Analytics, Google Analytics, and a user community, we can track the effectiveness of the interventions around the world, and perform analytics on our metrics from the many users our platform quantifying the impact we are having. With the user community, new ideas can be shared, and more lives can be saved.  "", 'We carried out research on different methods of conducting CPR and broke it down into 3 different groups: adults, children and infants. We found current applications that exist were very isolated, dry and outdated. We consulted an industry expert,   Trauma Nurse, and Police Officers. We received feedback from them about how vital an application like ours could be for them in the line of duty and how we could further improve Save A Life. We worked with talented developers to create a unique platform to connect individuals through healthcare - you will always remember the person who saved your life, or a family members life. We wanted to make it easily accessible in order to reach a wider audience, especially people in underserved communities and in developing countries. People in these regions may have limited access to electronics, and might only own a cellphone.

"DeFiZap","Allocate your assets across multiple DeFi protocols in one transaction. Save time. Save gas.","[9156, 'Since publishing educational guides about popular DeFi tools (DeFiTutorials.com) and observing early-users’ simulations on DeFi Strategies, we were inspired to create an easy way for anyone (no matter how much they know about using each DeFi tool) to get instant access to multiple DeFi protocols. Right now, DeFi is just a buzzword to most people. We even noticed someone taking advantage of the DeFi community\'s current traction. They set up ""DeFi"" tokens to make gains through the unawareness of other people who believe \'DeFi\' is an asset they can invest in through these tokens. People see ETH locked in DeFi going up and think, “How can I get exposure to that growth?!” We are putting education at the core of our approach to make sure this doesn\'t happen to anyone. ', ""Zap is a smart contract that auto-spreads incoming deposits across Compound, Fulcrum, TokenSets and others, in a single transaction and based on pre-set allocations - bypassing many manual steps. You can send ETH to a Zap contract of your choosing and receive allocated tokens. For example, Lender Zap allocates incoming deposits 90% to cDai and 10% to dLETH2x. Therefore, if you send 1 ETH to this Zap, you will receive 0.9 ETH's worth of cDai and place a 2X margin trade with 0.1 ETH on Fulcrum (giving you exposure to 0.2 ETH). Lender's Zap is interesting because, within a year, the interest generated from cDai could completely cover your margin trade purchase.Think of it as trading with your future interest earned. We have also created a 'Zap Generator' to help end-users filter available Zaps based on their investment goals and risk profile. Users answer a few multiple-choice questions to see which Zap might fit their needs. Some combinations are still being finalized so please do not take this as investment advice. During this hackathon, you can view almost all available Zaps generated, but only Lender Zap is live on the mainnet. *** UPDATE: We deployed ETH Maximalist Zap - open BTC short & ETH 2X margin trades on Fulcrum in a single transaction. Learn more here.Lender.DefiZap.eth and ETHMax.DeFiZap.eth are registered on The Ethereum Name Service so that transacting on Compound + Fulcrum is as easy as sending a deposit from your wallet.Ultimately, we intend to allow our users to be able to create their own Zaps, based on their custom requirements. In the meantime, you can submit a custom Zap request here. "", 'For the LenderZap (see here), we have 3 Smart Contracts that deploy the investment received from the user into cDai and dLETH2x.  The primary reason to write 3 different Smart Contracts is to keep all the Smart Contract code modularised, keeping security as the prime goal.  The first contract with which our front-end interacts (see here) accepts ETH does the necessary allocation of ETH and sends it to the two(2) Sub Smart Contracts that make the investments.  Both our Sub Smart Contracts (see here and here) have a function which then makes the investment.  The Key Points to be noted over here are:-The investment functions take the address of the investor from the Main Smart Contract as the Address to which the assets are to be bought and sold;-For ETH to WETH to DAI, we use the Kyber Network’s Proxy Contract using the swapEtherToToken function; and-For the investment in Fulcrum, we talk to the Fulcrum Interface and interact with the mintWithEther function.-Keeping Security in mind, our Main Smart Contract and the two Sub Smart Contracts have a fall back function which also makes the investment once an ETH is sent to their address.-Since both the Sub Smart Contracts do not do any allocation of ETH they are modular plug and play and can be used behind any smart contract which does a different allocation.Keeping Security in mind, our Main Smart Contract also has security toggles that can stop the function of making any investments. ', 'Work in Progress with Token Sets: The Major Challenge that we ran into was working on creating a ZAP on top of TokenSets.  Sadly that is still work in progress.  Sadly their entire smart contract infrastructure does not simply accept ETH to mint the necessary rebalancing Sets.  For this purpose, we had to create a Smart Contract that works with the Provable Oracle to call for the price of the Set every time investment had to be made.  However, even after solving that major hurdle, we learned that every investor who had to interact with the Sets Smart Contract had to have not just WETH (for which we were using Kyber Network) but also any other component asset that they have defined in their smart contract - adding to this, there was NO way to determine how much quantity of either of the component assets were required.  This threw a major ball into our direction.  We are now working with the Token Sets team to resolve this issue so that we can add that as a product offering really really soon.Lost USD50 worth ETH due to wrong interaction with the Compound Protocol: While doing our first round of testing on the mainnet, our Invest2cDAI function interacted with the Mint Function of the Compound Contract and accepted uint as a return.  This uint should be the cDAI tokens that are minted.  We then straight-away asked for the Compound Smart Contract to transfer the output uint received.  We realized, the hard way, that we were wrong.  The returned uints were not being picked by the transfer function thus locking our assets.  Thus, we had to re-do a new contract which would first check our updated balanceOf and then do a 100% transfer of cDAI.No sync on Test Nets:   We could not, unfortunately, Test our contracts on Test Nets due to main reason that the DAI and WETH tokens that the Kyber Network, Compound Protocol or bzx Protocol recognized were different (their own custom addresses).  Due to which the interaction between multiple protocols on the Test Net was a challenge.A Global Team: Our team is spread across 5 cities from 4 different countries with 4 different time zones. Singapore, Mumbai, Pune, Peru, & New York. We all come from various individual backgrounds, but ended up working as a team for this hackathon. We range from Accountants, to Entrepreneurs, to Developers, to recent Computer Science graduates. Despite all of our variations, we acclimated to seamlessly communicate and actualize the product from the ground up effectively. ', ""-Accessing DeFi protocols through Zaps, costs less gas than individually transacting on each one to attain the same result. For example, going from ETH to cDai on Compound and ETH to dLETH2x on Fulcrum will end up costing you ~$5-$6 in transaction fees. Lender's Zap helps you acheive ETH to cDai + LONG2xBZX in a single transaction, for ~$0.86-$1.76. -Registering Lender Zap on ENS, now investing into Compound + Fulcrum is as easy as sending a deposit from your wallet to Lender.DefiZap.eth "", 'We learned a lot about different investment strategies that could be ‘remixed’ with available DeFi tools and how to calculate overall ROIs.

"Guardian","The number of firefighter injuries has increased by over 28% in the past 30 years. Our team sought to tackle this issue by creating a novel helmet utilizing IOT to improve firefighter safety.","[7574, 'We believe that the impact of ideas is the foundation on which we should build our world on. Our team was inspired to take on a challenge that would improve the lives of those around us while remaining true to our roots. When the Fort McMurray fires of 2016 destroyed over 3244 homes and caused 9.9 billion USD in damages, the lives of our team members were transformed. Coming from Alberta, the effects of the fire left a lasting impression on our views of how technology can be used for good and helped us discover a newfound sense of purpose. We sought to use new and novel technologies to make this a reality. Guardian is a novel helmet designed to advance current firefighting methods. By attaching various crucial sensors on the helmet, we are able to gather important vitals about the environment such as temperature, CO2 levels, atmospheric pressure, volume of total organic compounds, and much more while simultaneously sending this data in real-time over the Internet of Things platform to a remote database. We then retrieved this information and created a unique web user interface that responded to the real-time changes in data to relay information across all individuals over watching the situation.  ', 'The Guardian firefighter helmet sends and retrieves information by using six sensors connected to a central microcontroller capable of connecting to nearby WiFi networks. When information from the environment is extracted, we are capable of sending this information using WiFi following the IOT protocol to a remote real-time database where it is stored and processed. When this information is retrieved, it is used to create a web user interface that displays the information in a real-time framework to show changes as they happen. This interface allows all subscribers to the web app to monitor the situation different firefighters are and providing assistance when needed. ', 'The microcontroller we used for this project is the NodeMCU board which is an Internet of Things enabled board built on top of the Arduino framework. We then attached several sensors to the board (DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor, CCS811 Air Quality Sensor, BME280 Atmospheric and Pressure Sensor, and VEML6070 UV Index Sensor) following the I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol where we used a multi-master/multi-slave architecture to allow sensors to publish and receive data to the bus system. When the data is received by the NodeMCU microcontroller, the data is sent over WiFi to a real-time Google Firebase database where it is categorized by sensor and type of data. This information is then retrieved and displayed on a web app user interface updated in real-time. The web app is built using the Vue.js framework to process the real-time data. Other areas of the web app such as the front-end design are built using the HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. Additional features were implemented using Bootstrap, and ApexGraphs.  ', 'Throughout the project, our team ran into several challenges regarding the hardware aspect of the implementation of the helmet. As this was our first time using the IOT framework, we found it difficult in the beginning to find a method of connecting to WiFi. When we initially tried to use an Arduino Uno board and connected an ESP8266 WiFi module to it, we found that the setup required to connect to Google Firebase required several external frameworks that we were unable to implement. As a result, we switched over to the NodeMCU board which had the ESP8266 WiFi chip already built into the board. However, since this is a much smaller microcontroller, the number of input and output data pins was half of that of the Arduino Uno. In order to counteract this, our team members learned to use the I2C protocol which allowed us to connect several sensors to only one bus and save the input and output pins.  ', ""As a team, we overcame multiple challenges in order to produce a fully functional product. We were able to integrate both hardware and software into this project. On the hardware side, we implemented a total of six sensors: temperature, carbon dioxide concentration, total volatile organic compounds. We are very proud of connecting most sensors through the I2C protocol, making the product lighter and more portable. On the software side, we implemented real-time database using Google's FIrebase. By uploading real-time data collected from the sensors to the database and retrieving them to the web application, operators behind the screens will have an accurate picture of the fire scene. They will be able to make appropriate decisions to better exterminate the fire and possibly safe the lives of the firefighters. "", 'This project taught us the importance of communication protocols. Since we had team members working on the software side as well as team members working on the hardware side. It was crucial for us to establish a communication protocol early on in the project as it is difficult for both teams to work on the project simultaneously if the software team was not retrieving data from the hardware team. In order to overcome this, we made sure to establish a solid form of communication of data so the software team knew exactly how to fetch the data and what format it would be in. By doing this, as the hardware team was integrating more sensors, the software team was able to generate their own faux data following the same communication protocol before real data was provided. This made integrating the two sides of the project at the end very easy and efficient.  ', 'In the future, we plan on implementing a full master-slave protocol between the web app and the microcontroller. Currently, the microcontroller is capable of sending information to Google Firebase and the web app is capable or retrieving it, however, the opposite is not possible. Having the web app alert firefighters of unstable or dangerous conditions is crucial in the safety for all parties involved, as a result, in the future we will want to implement the ability for the web app to publish to Google Firebase as well and allow the microcontroller to retrieve this data and provide feedback to the user. For example, if one helmet detects a dramatic increase in CO2 gas, a notification will be able to the sent to all helmets after the data has been parsed and sent to the web app.  ']","['iot', 'arduino', 'vue.js', 'javascript', 'html5', 'css3', 'c', 'c++', 'firebase', 'google-cloud', 'i2c', 'hardware', 'bootstrap', 'apex-charts']","True","47","['maxonezhou', 'tpinto7', 'ericfeng', 'darrylwu']","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/840/765/datas/small.png","False","0"

"Project Dumpster 1.01","Picking up litter...gamified. Integration of game mechanics to encourage large scale trash collection.","[4326, 'The Roomba and Pokemon Go. We wanted to combine the idea of an autonomous robot that collects trash (humans are better for this) and the fun of an augmented reality game to utilize gamification strategies in a socially beneficial manner. ', ""There are 2 main components to this project. Service Bots, the autonomous, trash seeking robots, and the mobile application. Service bots roam around looking for objects that have similar physical attributes to trash (objects that are typically low to the ground). Once a service bot detects an object, it drops a pin to the google maps activity in the application at the coordinates specified on the communicator android phone which is on the bot. It is up to the user to look for this trash to redeem points, the user must take a picture of the object while in the app which then sends the image to the Google Cloud Vision API, which returns probabilities of the object in the image being some other image. The application is looking for high similarity hits of certain objects that we have predefined to be trash (water bottle, glass bottle, etc). If the user's image has high likelihood of being trash, the user will be credited. "", 'I, Sean Connolly, a Computer Science major from Northeastern University, and my friend from high school, Conor Boston, an Aerospace Engineering major from Pennsylvania State University teamed up to take on this project. This is our first time working with an Arduino (definitely not our last), there was a hefty learning curve for both of us.Conor handled the electronics and hardware components of the project: Arduino 101, Uno, Motorshield, Ultrasonic Sensor, Solar Panel and external power supplies. Conor has had experience working with robots in the past, this is why I recruited him to the Project.I worked on building the software for the Android application and both of the Arduinos. I had built android apps before this project, but mostly simple tic tac toe games or soundboard apps. So an augmented reality game was significantly more challenging, and rewarding. Also the allure of learning a thing or two about hardware was very appealing. ', 'As mentioned before, the learning curve was the challenge. Coming from no experience with Arduinos or micro-controllers, it was very intimidating at first to begin, however, online resources and ease of use of the Arduinos on board capabilities such as the accelerator, made this manageable for us.

"Butler for Trello","Automate Trello in plain English.","[4188, ""I used Trello to track my development projects. At some point, I realized I was doing a lot of repetitive actions, and decided to look into solving it.I created a simple bot that would allow you to do a few Trello things automatically, and made an announcement in the Trello subreddit. It had a very positive reception, which made me think there was a need to be covered.But the bot wasn't integrated in Trello and it was hard to use. So I decided early on that I would write a Power-Up, but it took me a long time to figure out how to fit automation into the Trello UI. Eventually, it clicked: the Power-Up experience is all about integrating fully with the UI, and one of the most powerful capabilities that Power-Ups allow is the integration of custom buttons in the UI.So, using the experience learned on the bot, I built the Power-Up relatively quickly, and we finally launched it in June 12th this year with very good feedback. "", 'The Butler Power-Up lets you add contextual buttons to Trello that, when clicked, perform automated series of actions. For example, a button show in a card can move it to the ""To Do"" list, add me as a member and post a comment.I also added actions that are not available in Trello. For example, you can copy or move one or more cards randomly selected from a list, or sort a list by due date, title, time in list, labels or a custom field.Importantly, you don\'t even need to create the buttons. The Power-Up is able to gather statistics of your Trello usage and recommends buttons specifically for you and for each particular board.Buttons can be shared with other team members so teams can apply consistent processes and everyone can improve their productivity with minimal effort. ', ""The server runs on node.js on AWS Lambda. I don't tend to use many frameworks or libraries so most of it is hand-written JavaScript. I make full use of the facilities provided by the Power-Up API, such as  data storage at the board and team level. I store other data on DynamoDB. "", 'Trello is surprisingly flexible, and from the early start it was obvious that every person uses in their own way and wants to automate different things. So a big problem was how to provide all these options without creating a monstrous and hard-to-use user interface. I solved this by using a natural-language user interface, in which the user basically writes English sentences describing what she wants to do. ', ""I'm proud of the level of integration accomplished. The button experience feels natural and being contextual is pretty darn useful. It's a testament to how well the Trello Power-Up API is built that I was able to integrate this deep.I'm also proud of the flexibility and power that the product offers. It's relatively easy to create single-function power-ups, but it's extremely hard to make something that allows so many combinations with a reasonably simple user interface.  I don't think there's anything like this in any other project management platform. "", 'As mentioned before, Trello hides surprising power and flexibility in an apparently simple package. I learned a lot from seeing all the different ways people use Trello for different applications, from managing household chores to organizing small assembly lines. Our users include lawyers, estate agents, car repair shops, virtual assistants, software project managers, ... you name it! ', ""We will continue to expand what it does, in particular the range of actions that it can perform.There's also going to be major new features that will make it even more useful. Without giving away too much, we plan to add the ability to show or hide buttons depending on certain conditions, such as which list the current card is in. Also, the ability to automatically add due dates to cards based to text typed in them, and have commands that are triggered by due dates.

"EthOptions","A decentralized ERC20 Options Trading platform to hedge against your crypto investments by leveraging profits and managing risks.","[5627, 'The cryptocurrency market saw a dramatic fallout throughout 2018. With Bitcoin falling from a value of $17,000 per coin in January of 2018 to around $3,500, many traders incurred losses since the start of the year.Whether you are a trader or an investor, your objective is to make money. Your secondary objective is to do so with the minimum acceptable level of risk.Now Derivatives are financial instruments that aim to increase returns and reduce risk. A Derivative is a financial instrument that derives its value from an underlying asset, in this case, cryptocurrencies. An Option is a contract that gives an investor the right — but not the obligation — to buy/sell an asset at a certain price within a certain period of time.The idea behind ETHOptions is to introduce options contracts over the blockchain, for traders to hedge against their crypto investments beyond Bitcoin. Bitcoin Options do exist, however as the market share of ERC20 tokens have grown to 91% due to the daily trading volumes and number of projects existing on the Ethereum Blockchain, Options contract for ERC20 tokens will have a huge market outreach.All the major crypto players are getting into Bitcoin derivatives. Whereas, derivatives for Ethereum based tokens is still an untouched market.We’re providing a new Crypto Asset class that can potentially have a market size of $42 Billion. ', ""We have created a decentralized ERC20 Options Trading platform. On our platform, the option Maker can create an order, filling out the details which are added as an order to our Orderbook making it available for everyone to access. Along with the details, he must also give the allowance to transfer the BaseTokens to the escrow to be released when the option is exercised.The Taker can choose the most profitable option in the Orderbook according to his judgement and fill it. To do so, he would be prompted to pay the premium for that option in the QuoteToken. Using Kyber, traders can swap the required ERC20 at the time of payment and pay with whichever ERC20 tokens they have. They receive the ERC721 OptionTokens for the corresponding option order filled.Before the expiry time, the Taker can choose to exercise his Option by giving his OptionTokens to purchase the locked BaseTokens at the Strike Price, in terms of QuoteTokens. This will be possible after verification by the smart contract wrt to expiry time and Market Price of the BaseToken according to a Chainlink Oracle which takes the price through a Coinmarketcap API. Using Chainlink, we were able to ensure the integrity of data sensitive to the trading. Taker can then sell BaseTokens in the market, thereby making a profit of (MarketPrice - StrikePrice) per locked BaseToken.Challenges we ran intoOne of the major challenges while conceptualising the platform was that it would be difficult to make the platform popular as people would need the corresponding ERC20 token for the option they choose, restricting scalability. While exploring Kyber, we realised this problem will be solved successfully by integrating Kyber with our platform and allowing users to pay through it.One of the implementation challenges was writing the contracts such that no bad user input can get through, i.e., learning basic auditing to create a secure implementation. Also, another challenge was testing on public networks since we needed data from public networks like Kyber and Chainlink.Accomplishments that we're proud ofWe’re proud that we have managed to create a seamless user interface on top of the complicated smart contracts to successfully implement our vision. We believe our platform can help propel the mass adoption of ERC20 tokens and hence of blockchain by encouraging investment in more tokens. We are thus proud of having positively impacted the DeFi and Web3.0 space. What we learnedMaking this project has been a truly amazing learning experience, from learning about the decentralised finance space and how options work to learning about decentralised oracles and swapping protocols. Moreover, we learnt how to successfully write multiple inter-dependent smart contracts in sync with each other. We also learnt to properly use the Truffle Suite, to deploy contracts and write tests, and hence create a robust DApp.What's next for EthOptionsFor the future of EthOptions, we intend to extend the functionality by also introducing Put Options. We want to make the OptionTokens tradable so that one can sell their position. Also, we intend to extend the asset class our platform caters to, beyond ERC20 tokens by using the Synthetix platform. Besides the longing and shorting of Call and Put options, we intend on integrating popular Option strategies such as Covered/Married Call, Bull & Bear Call/Put Spreads, Iron Condor, etc. to benefit from all sorts of market movements. The platform will allow for a Plug-n-Play approach to easily form option strategies.For amateur traders, ETHOptions will show the possible strategies based on the market conditions that the trader can benefit from.

"", ""The idea behind the service is very simple. First, you define what a perfect weather means for you at a given moment in time. Currently, you can filter by temperature, wind speed, precipitation type and probability of precipitation. Then, the service does the rest and you are presented with the best matching destinations. The results are sorted by the amount of perfect days, those matching the original query, found in a week for each city and limited to top five. Perfect days are also marked with a different background. Currently, only 100 touristy cities in Europe are supported.Let's see how we could use the service for the use cases defined in the previous section.Set the wind to be between 16 and 32 km/h ideal for flying a kite, small chance of rain, comfortable temperature.Set the min temperature to be warm enough for you, set the chance of rain to 0%.Set the temperature to be around and below 0 C, choose snow as a precipitation type and the chance of precip. to be high.Set the wind speed to be less than 16km/h, little rain and clouds as you want to avoid it being too sunny and have the fish go deeper in the water, comfortable temperature.Choose whatever conditions you want to have for your multi-day cycling trip.If you wish, you can easily check out how to get to your chosen destination,as the application comes integrated with a travel search service SkyScanner.

"Modified Dijkstra algorithm for optimal navigation ","Modified algorithm to assign most optimal path for better navigation","[4305, 'The 21st century ushered with it the age of smart and predictive technology with the optimum use of resources to make life easier and take preventive measures against predicted mishaps. In accordance with this trend, the proposal is an automated (SAE level 5) mode of transport using a modified Dijkstra’s algorithm with concepts of Ant Colony Optimization, big data analytics and cloud computing for number crunching to arrive at the destination based on the traffic and the number of drivers on the road, in the shortest time possible instead of the usual shortest distance algorithms. The analysis of the time saved by the drivers for different map types is recorded and compared and the results are found to be more efficient with respect to time as compared to the time taken by the original Dijkstra’s algorithm. ', 'Start: the user is logged into the system as soon as the car is turned on. Choose the destination: The source and destination are chosen based on the current position as identified by the GPS system and the input by the user respectively. The path is set for the shortest travel time: Using the proposed modified algorithm, based on all the users currently logged onto the system and their current position and destination the route that takes the shortest time to travel is set.Automated transport: Using the grid based system where the inaccessible roads are blocked out by giving a very high value and the weight is taken in accordance with the speed the car can achieve on the particular road, the user is transported from source to destination. Arrive at destination: With minimal sensors, this automated mode transport uses big data analytics and cloud computing to ferry people from one place to another safely.Stop: Once the car is stopped, the user has logged off the system.The first part of the prototype consists of the modified Dijkstra’s algorithm in which the shortest path is determined based on the time taken and not on the distance between the source and destination. (how many people own cars) (statistically how many people would want to go to the same place at the same time in a particular place) If the shortest route is to take the I-16 and turn north towards the bridge, and all 100 people take the I-16 and turn north, then imagine the traffic jam a vehicle would be stuck in with the agonising honking and bumper to bumper trafficThe whole ground can be represented as a grid or a matrix. A path can then be plotted based on the parts of the grid that are free. For example, if there is a pothole then that part of the grid can be made as inaccessible and will not show as a viable route that can be taken. Similarly to all the places that are on either side of the road. ', 'We built it using C++. ', 'To identify the parameters that were required to be considered and to make sure that the time complexity of the algorithm is as less as possible. ', ""The trial runs performed for a number of matrices of varying sizes and the time saved by each of the drivers were taken as an output and for a small map size of 10x10, the combined time taken was reduced by close to 26%. As the map size increases, we can observe that the time saved for each driver is increased. This shows that with the increase in map size that the real world scenario will have, the time saved will increase thus proving the efficiency of the modified algorithm and ensuring high performing automated cars.What's next for Modified Dijkstra algorithm for optimal navigationThe future work would be to build a prototype of the model and go over the safety features in the case of a failure with a fine comb and to build a real-time web version of it.Built Withc++      Submitted to    MHacks NanoWinner                All Submissions                  Created by  Mashrin SrivastavaSaumya SuvarnaGarima Gupta "", ' ', 'The future work would be to build a prototype of the model and go over the safety features in the case of a failure with a fine comb and to build a real-time web version of it.

"If-Found-Lost","No need to write your contact information on the things that can be lost or misplaced again.","[4072, ""Here is how I got the idea. I once forgot my laptop charger at the library in University. It took me 3 days to find it at the end, because there is no way to contact me, for a person who finds it. I could have written my name, mobile number and contact information on it, but it is embarrassing because every sees it. So I thought how can I solve this problem and are there any existing one. I could find that there isn't any existing solution. So I focused on it. What I need is something everybody can easily see, but cannot contact me or bug me throw it. I think it may look like a encryption problem too. I alway enjoyed compiling innovating solutions to problems, so I got a solution and here we are. "", 'When a user create an account in If-Found-Lost.com he get a globally unique numeric id which is short to be easily rememberable and writable. So if the id is 7766 it makes a URL, www.If-Found-Lost.com/7766. So instead of private contact information this is what he writes or prints on his items. For example he can write it in his books, in the keytag of his backpack or in his quadcopter. The name If-Found-Lost is there to make the intuition that what should you do ""if you found this lost"". So lets say Ann found my charger so she just has to go to that link and need to enter the best way to contact her as it asks. She does not need any login or create an account, just to go trough a captcha. Then I will get the message right away to my inbox in If-Found-Lost, saying Ann has found this and this is the way to contact her. So I am the one who decides whether to contact her or not. So I am directly contacting Ann and getting it, and I did not expose my privacy details to the public.Here is another thing, I thought how to expand this as a business. For an unique id given by the website, we\'l say it as IFL(stands for If-Found-Lost id). So If my packpack or music player coming with an IFL built-in, I do not have to write my id on it. Just as we login to warantee information, after buying that item we go to If-Found-Lost.com and link that IFL with our account. This gives manufactures a competitve advantage, becuae lets say switss gear is joining with us and with every backPack it comes with a uniqueID printed and it makes their backPacks globally findable without exposing the privacy of the owner. ', 'I am using MeteorJS and mongoDB for databases. Using semantic-ui to give it a nice look and some fast rendering. Using google recaptcha for authentications where it does not need to sign in. Created the website to look and feel simple as possible which makes users happy. ', 'I had to build this on my own without teammates, because we are having an exam tomorrow and everybody is busy with that. So I worked straight 24 hours to implement this. Meteor makes is great and most importantly fun to develop. I was familiar with C++ and Java before, so this was a real fun to do. It took me time to make videos and stuff because I did all individually in a limited time. But the hackathon was one hell of a fun. ', 'If-Found-Lost is now a fully working product.

Next plan is to build a userbase for the website and to talk with backpack, purse, quadcopter, etc; manufactures to sell them the service of If-Found-Lost.com at a price per IFL.

Max capacity for cars to go through Hsueshan Tunnel is 2,400/hr and the average weekend car flow is 71,000 cars. There have been a wide range of discussions on how to tackle the issues from providing instant monitoring to leveraging the public transportation to reduce the total car flow. Are there any other options we can leverage to reduce some pains and time spent waiting on the road?

"Build Meister","Trigger &amp; get the status of your builds with your voice, without having to log into a computer!","[3788, 'We wanted to improve the performance and efficiencies for Development Teams. We were looking to increase development performance by loading build status requests and trigger new builds, using a self-service setup. This led us to build a new Alexa Skill; We call it Build Meister. ', 'The Alexa Skill queries build tools through a proxy node service and retrieves build status information. It then triggers new builds on an associated project. If the project and plan keys are provided, the Alexa Skill would be associated with a particular plan. If not, the Alexa Skill would query information across multiple build plans within a project and provides the results of the top 5 most recent builds. From there, the Alexa Skill requests that the user chooses an option number. The user can then select an option by saying the associated number. To end a search, the user would use the commands, ""Stop"" or ""Cancel"".Get Last Build Status This query retrieves the last build status from the project key provided in the CI Proxy service. If the build plan is not specified in the config file, then Alexa would provide the user with options to choose one of the build plans.Get Last Successful Build This query retrieves the last successful build from the project key provided within the CI Proxy service. If the build plan is not specified in the config file, then Alexa would provide the user with options to choose one of the build plans. Last failed Build Retrieves the last failed build in the plan.Trigger New Build Triggers a manual build in the plan.How We built itThis Alexa Skill queries a proxy node service that runs on the client server. The node service connects to their internal CI tool (such as Bamboo or Jenkins), and queries build status information and has the ability to trigger new builds. Since the node service runs internally, users do not have to provide CI tool credentials to the Alexa Skill. This is because the Alexa Skill and the proxy node service share authorized keys that allow requests from the Alexa Skill and blocks all other requests.Challenges We ran intoOne of the main challenges that we ran into, was that we decided to use the Serverless Framework to setup our Alexa Skill, as well as the API Gateway and Lambda connections. During the setup of the API Gateway, we chose to use Lambda as the integration point from API Gateway instead of lambda-proxy. This meant that we were required to setup some items manually within the API Gateway to allow the requests to work. This caused an issue when we tried to move the project from our AWS Dev account to our Production account. We had to duplicate the manual steps instead of being able to do it with Serveless\' CLI functionality.Proud AccomplishmentsPreviously, all of the Lambda functions were created manually by compressing and uploading through the Amazon portal.

"OrchestrAI","An improvisational AI that unleashes the creative power of an entire orchestra to music producers and artists","[8539, 'News outlets today are quick to publish how modern AI is literally superhuman in most fields, driving systemic change in the way our societies and economies are organized. Despite its far-reaching impact, AI has never felt less accessible. It seems like somewhere in the process of beating Go, captioning our images, and driving autonomous vehicles, AI has paradoxically lost its human touch. We want to bring that connection back in a way that fosters creativity and recognizes the strengths of both man and machine. We believe that something as powerful as AI should have a soul and, most importantly, expand human souls.  We want to empower music producers, artists and enthusiasts, giving them access to an entire orchestra of artificial agents to compose, create and improvise music. Rather than using AI to replace human talent, we see this as a means to augment and supercharge existing human facilities and intuition, allowing human composers to reach creative heights that were never possible before, both through real-time improvisational cues and procedurally generated sonic compositions.  ', 'We have built an AI orchestra, capable of improvising musical pieces in real time, inspiring and adapting to the humans it is playing with, and generating completely new songs based on its experience. We organized these three capabilities under two distinct pipelines within our platform. Ad Hoc improvisation and procedural generation is accomplished through our Neural Pipeline. The pipeline itself is driven by two different models. One consists of a character generating Recurrent Neural Network, capable of reading audio MIDI files and learning their structure. This network can then generate creative pieces on the piano, violin, cello, and trumpets. The songs we created sound both euphonic and aggressive, very different from what a normal human would compose. After seeing these results, we became very interested about what networks designed by actual music theorists can do. This caused us to also incorporate elements of Hexahedria’s Biaxial Recurrent Network within our pipeline. This model explicitly learns pieces by using music theory and multiple recurrence dimensions (temporal and note spaces) to generate beautiful music. Those results made us very excited, thinking about the different kinds of music that different AI architectures can create. Real-time adaptive playing is accomplished through the Improvisational Pipeline. This consists of an Arduino and two microphones (one from a set of Apple ear pods) mounted to a classical violin, which pick up the notes being played on our violin. We isolate these notes by sampling based on the beat. The note itself is determined by running a Fast Fourier Transform on the signal received and then extracting the most prominent frequency (a note is essentially a particular frequency). Finally, these extracted notes are mapped to new notes based on Music Theory, using concepts such as the pentatonic scale, perfect fourths, etc. ', 'This project made extensive use of the WolframAPI and Mathematica, mainly to convert signals from the violin to midi files. We also use Mathematica to output the processed notes as various instruments in our improvisational pipeline. Finally, our Neural Pipeline took advantage of the variety and abundance of built-in instruments within Mathematica to generate distinct sound profiles for our orchestral compositions with the RNN.The Neural module was built in tensor-flow, making extensive use of the RNN modules that were available then. The char-rnn architecture used to compose some of the songs takes into input textualized MIDI files and processes them through 2 hidden layers. After the training process, the network is able to generate textualized MIDI data, which then can be converted into actual music through the Wolfram API.  The biaxial RNN consisted of two vertical stacks of LSTM-RNN nodes who were interconnected, the note and time networks, each with two hidden layers. The input would consist of a vector consisting a vector’s MIDI note alongside some information on the note’s vicinity and the history of notes played. The input would then be passed through a vanilla recurrent time axis, in order to learn some structure. Then, the output of the time network would be passed to the note axis, who makes recurrent connections alongside other Note nodes. This ensures that the network is able to learn connections between different notes and their relationship to each other throughout multiple musical piecesThe Improvisational pipeline was powered by digital signal processing. The fundamental technique in digital signal processing is the Fast Fourier Transform, a O(n log n) algorithm that is incredibly versatile in its scope and application. In our project, it allowed us to filter different notes just through their frequencies. Since FFTs are just something that the three Computer Science majors in the group had studied in theory until that point, it was incredible to see its power when implementing it to build our application. ', 'Even in our demos, lag consistently hampered our efforts to sound euphonic. The best way we found to mitigate this was timing the delay so that it is always behind by a factor of the beats per minute of the violin composition. This is a fundamental limit in all sampling based approaches and requires a more sophisticated predictive model to completely eliminate.The neural networks also had issues. The most basic one was training time since the neural networks took 10 hours to train on all of our datasets. The most crucial challenge was out of our hands though. We had several problems in making the char-RNN learn musical structure, as it would often play awkward combination of notes, spend large amounts of time not playing anything and then compressing dozens of notes in a few seconds. More training epochs helped remediate this problem, but the architecture still needs better forms of representing musical structure in order to be more effective. ', 'Hardware – we literally hacked hardware to make it bend to our whims and needs for this project. Our hardware wizard (Azra) spent an incredible amount of time working with microphones and signals Artificial Intelligence – we had very little experience with non–traditional neural network architectures, especially exotic ones like the double weaved biaxial recurrent neural network used by Hexahedria. This project enabled us to understand how small architectural changes in neural nets can produce gigantic differences on a network’s output. ', 'Neural Nets take forever to train and it’s hard to predict their behavior after training. We also learned a lot from our mentors at Wolfram, especially regarding on how music can be made and represented by computers. ', 'We would love to use more advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques even in our improvisational pipeline, provided delay is not a limiting factor. We would love to integrate ensembles of neural network models and see how they would play together with each other, besides adding in better ML models to the pipeline. We also want to find more ways to connect this pipeline to the human element, by maybe providing more ways for the AI to help a human generate/create music.

"Limbr Reports for JIRA Cloud","Slice and dice your data with powerful custom reports, directly within JIRA - no spreadsheets required","[6777, 'Through my consulting practice, Limbr, I help software and marketing teams become more efficient and more effective through the application of lean and agile methods. I implement the Atlassian Cloud stack (JIRA Software, Tempo Timesheets, Confluence, BitBucket, HipChat) for each of my clients, customized with a set of battle-tested conventions and configurations that I\'ve honed over the last 5 years. While the setup works well overall, I have always found that the reporting capabilities left a little to be desired - far too frequently, a client asks me ""how do I find out... "", and my best answer has been ""run such and such JQL query, export the data to Excel, and manipulate the spreadsheet this way and that way"". This works, but presents a real hassle for users for simple ad-hoc reporting needs.For example, say I want to know the average velocity of one of my Scrum teams over the past eight sprints. I could either run the Velocity Report included in JIRA Software and break out my calculator to manually sum and average the shipped Story Points, or I could run a JQL query to filter for the relevant issues, export to CSV, and add aggregation functions to the spreadsheet. Furthermore, I want to calculate this figure before every sprint planning session in order to inform the team\'s commitment for the upcoming sprint. What a pain!I thought there must be a better way, and searched for viable solutions in the Marketplace. Unfortunately, while there were several reporting and business intelligence add-ons available for JIRA Cloud, they were all predicated on exporting JIRA data to an external BI tool. These tools are no doubt powerful, however needing to leave JIRA to perform basic segmentation or aggregation was exactly what I wanted to avoid. Additionally, I needed a solution that was both accessible and intuitive to grasp for a wide range of JIRA users, which was at odds with the requirement of buying and learning a sophisticated external tool.Thus, Limbr Reports for JIRA Cloud was born.  ', 'Limbr Reports essentially bolts a reporting engine directly into the JIRA user interface. Users can easily create a report, and then customize the presentation with a variety of configuration options. Each report sources issue data from a base query, constructed with JQL. The user decides how to slice and dice the data, sorting and grouping with unrestricted levels of nesting. Additionally, the user can configure aggregations (sum, average, minimum and maximum) on supported field types (numbers and dates, initially), and the report will calculate these aggregations at runtime and summarize the data at the report and group level. ', ""The add-on was built with the 3REE stack - React, Redux, RethinkDB and Express. The reporting engine runs completely on the client-side, and uses React for the views and Redux for managing application state. The client fetches report data directly from JIRA using Atlassian Connect's AP library.To ensure that the client complied with Atlassian Design Guidelines, I ported a good chunk of the Atlassian UI library to reusable React components. I hope to further polish this library and release it open-source it in the future for the benefit of other add-on developers.The client needs to talk to the add-on backend in order to persist report configuration metadata. To accomplish this, I built a series of JSON API endpoints, exposed by Express and backed by RethinkDB. I leveraged Atlassian Connect Express to help with JWT auth, installation lifecycle, and a few other functions. The API runs on Heroku and the RethinkDB instance is hosted with Compose.io.  "", 'Much of the technology stack I chose was new to me (I intentionally chose bleeding-edge), and the learning curve was pretty steep. This was my first exposure to server-side JavaScript, to functional style programming in general, and to Redux and RethinkDB. Attempting to learn and correctly apply sane architecture, idioms and best practices was demanding and often frustrating. I ran into numerous technical issues along the way, including the need to fork and modify both Atlassian Connect Express (improved compatibility with Express 4.x) and a storage adapter for RethinkDB (added authentication support).Technical challenges aside, the largest challenge I grappled with was deciding on the feature scope of my minimum viable product. I have a laundry list of features that I wanted to include in this first release, and found it painful but necessary to aggressively cut scope in order to make the hackathon deadline.  ', 'My ""day job"" is technical consulting, and although I\'ve worked on and with software teams over the past eight years and write a bit of code here and there, I don\'t consider myself a developer. This was my most significant (by far) attempt at writing an app for commercial use, and I\'m frankly extremely satisfied that I was able to complete it unassisted and create something of value. Regardless of the eventual popularity of the add-on in the Marketplace, at minimum I now have a viable solution to a problem that, until now, my clients have faced daily. I consider that to be an success by any measure. ', 'I learned way too much to list - some of the major ones include:Discovering that I actually enjoy working with JS, after ES6/ES7, Babel and Webpack perform their magicFirst time working with Express and server-side JS in generalFirst time working with RethinkDB and with a JSON document store in generalFirst time working with Redux and Flux architecture in generalFirst time applying functional-style techniques in earnest, influenced heavily by idiomatic Redux ', 'I have a significant roadmap for Limbr Reports, including:User- and group-level access control for reportsBetter support for Agile custom fields and a handful of remaining system fieldsSupport for other report data sources (e.g. worklogs, sprints, releases, projects, users)Configure advanced filters, over and above JQL filtering capabilitiesSegmentation by custom bucketsCalculated columns (e.g. display a column that sums the values from two other columns)Scheduled report delivery (e.g. email a report out on a weekly basis)Export reports to PDF, HTML, CSVData visualizations and chartsExpose reports as dashboard gadgets ... and much, much more!Thanks for reading!

"Tandem Medical","Tandem is a software startup that will revolutionize hospital communications, with an initial focus on the ER.","[4466, ""Tandem was built by a team of people obsessed with solving big problems in healthcare.  We were first inspired to tackle the problem of inefficient internal hospital communications last spring, when researching how existing communications systems lead to high patient length of stay, ambulance diversion, left-without-being-seen patients, and other key KPI's.  To get to the root of the problem, we partnered up with Dr. Alex Mohseni, the Chief Innovation Officer of Emergency Medicine Associates, spent over 100 hours over the summer observing, shadowing, and interviewing staff in every role in a hospital at Doctor's Community Hospital in Maryland.  At the end of the summer the Managing Director of that hospital joined our team as an advising partner and we designed a solution to the problem of inefficient internal hospital communications (starting with ER and ancillary departments) in partnership with our advisors and numerous clinicians. Shortly later DCH and our advising partner Puneet committed to pilot our solution. "", 'Tandem has two core features that make it completely unique in the healthcare communications space: Role-based communication: Providers rarely (if ever) know the names of the people they need to communicate with in other departments (i.e. Lab, Imaging).  Systems such as pagers, phones, and HIPAA-messaging products require users to find out the name/number of the person they need to contact, a process that requires them to either waste time looking for that person or sit on hold for 20 minutes.  Tandem integrates with EHRs and hospital scheduling systems to automatically distribute messages based off on role, saving providers around an hour per patient (a multi-million dollar proposition for even a small hospital).Task-based communication: Task-based communication is the structuring of messages in a queue-based ticketing system, which pulls in the relevant parties automatically and gives them the tools they need to quickly resolve tasks.  This system allows providers to focus on the messages that require their input, reducing communications overload and driving efficiency. ', 'Tandem is hosted on a HIPAA compliant cloud provider, Healthcare Blocks, and is built with PostgresSQL, Node.js/Express.js, and React.js. The initial design was developed with two doctors, who now act as advising partners. A prototype based off the initial design was completed in early January, and since then we’ve been collecting feedback from medical professionals, nurses, and doctors to iterate our product. Through Healthcare Blocks, we’re also using Mirth Connect to interface with EHR systems. We intend for our pilot version of the app to be fully HIPAA compliant and integrated with EHR, which should be completed by end of March.

Combination of social channel & engaging chat-bot empowers team members with ease of access to scrum management tool and thus task status update is no more a problem as it can be done on the move. This will assure current project health can be monitored and risks can be mitigated in timely fashion. Chat-bot* is a smart software, which along with AI can connect with end users via “human like conversation”.  ', 'We have leveraged power of following technologies for overall solution.   Amazon Lex: We have used Amazon Lex for building conversational chatbots with natural language understanding (NLU) to recognize the intent of text. Lex enabled us to build applications with highly engaging user experience and lifelike conversational interactions. Lex’s deep learning allowed us to quickly and easily build sophisticated, natural language, conversational bots (“chatbots”)  Amazon Lambda: We have used Amazon Lambda as the backend for validating user inputs to Lex during conversation and also for fulfilling user request to update task when all valid inputs are provided  Enterprise connectors like (Rally/Version One): These enterprise connectors are integrated with Lambda to fetch & update data from Scrum tool residing at enterprise backend. In this case, validation Lambda via enterprise connector would be fetching user stories & tasks details from Rally to validate user inputs. Lambda will update the task status and other info once they are available during the concluding fulfillment phase.  Slack Bot App: We have leveraged the Slack app to enable it as front end of our chat bot. Slack is one of the ideal channel with it’s collaboration and team communication capabilities. It is perfect fit for a team (software project team in this use case). We have created Slack app virtual scrum master app and added it’s bot to software project team slack channel.

The tourist can then view the profile of a tourguide to judge whether or not he/she would be a good fit for them. Even if the tourist doesn\'t wish to contact the tourguide, they can even view the list of reccommended events, places, or experiences to adventure at a certain location. They can then decide when/where they want to meet up, if they decide to do so, and the tourguide can be tipped by the tourist.How We built itOur entire tech stack revolves around meteor.js which combines client and server side code into a single easy to deploy system. Meteor uses MongoDB for the database, and a templating language of HTML5 for the frontend. Much of the dynamic client interfacing and backend interfacing is written in javascript.Challenges We ran intoBefore this hackathon 36 hours ago, none of us had ever touched Meteor.js or had extensive experience with javascript.

With the advantage of using graphs being quite evident; applying machine learning algorithms on graphs can be used for tasks such as graph analysis, link prediction, clustering etc.Graph Embeddings are a way to encode the graph data as vectors that can effectively capture the structural information, such as the graph topology and the node to node relationships in the graph database. These embeddings can then be ingested by ML algorithms for performing various tasksHOW CAN GRAPH EMBEDDINGS BE USED?Graph embeddings can be used to perform various tasks including machine learning tasks.For example, embeddings of two nodes can be used to determine if a relationship can exist between them. Or, given a particular node and a relation, embeddings can be used to find similar nodes and rank them using similarity search algortihmsCommon applications include  knowledge graph completion and drug discovery where new relations can be dicovered between two nodes.

"faceband","Play the band with your friends using facial instruments","[4430, ""Recently more people are using Video chat apps such as Snapchat and Snow. However most functions such as filter and games were used more personally and lacked the concept of communicating. The fun of Video chat is that you can show your emotion at the moment and music is a powerful content to build a win-win connection between artists' creativity and general users' everyday life as if 'Instagram Music Sticker' has done since May 2018. (https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/instagram-stories-music/)Facebook already has dominant active users in social media market. Especially, WhatsApp and Messenger are the first and second globally popular mobile messenger apps, so a multi-play experience can intrigue more engagement from users and communities. Our team thought if people could play with their faces and make something in harmony as a band, it would be much more fun. "", 'faceband is basically a rhythm action game using facial movement effects from facebook or instagram. You can use your face as an interaction to play the notes like opening your mouth or winking. Each player can choose an instrument and build a sort of band and they can play a single song making harmony. ', 'Using Spark AR Studio, we tracked facial movements through the facetracker, and connected them into interaction. For example, a simple wink is a continuous action of, one eye closing and opening/ while the other eye is opened. Then we added a music script, so that when these facial actions are performed in the precise spot, the score would go up. We designed the Graphic elements and layout with sketch, and modeled the instrumental assets with cinema4d. In order to import 3D objects, we used AR Library in Spark AR Studio after uploading them to sketchfab. ', ""There were many obstacles in building the faceband but one of the interesting challenge was deciding which actions we could use, since the actions were limited to the head. When we tested 'shaking your head at the beat' we all got dizzy in a few shakes and thought it would be more like torturing, so we changed the action to slightly tilting the head.We wanted to make a multi-play AR experience, however currently Spark AR Studio doesn't have any feature and resource for an (independent camera user's) multi-play effect. If coming updates can provide creators with such assets and resources, faceband team will definitely use them for the next milestone. "", ""By extending the effects of the camera app, we proposed the possibility of a game implementation, and furthermore, adds communication elements that can be enjoyed together, such as competing by sharing each other's images or combining them into a single content. "", ""We've used Spark AR Studio, MuseScore, MusicXML, and many other tools for the first time and are now familiar with them. "", ""We do not yet use a facemesh, but it might be useful and effective for users who do not want to expose their genuine face or for faceband game to give penalties for missing beats by distorting players' face. Thus, we can update it to the next version.Additionally, if a group of players were able to select music in a library being updated by the music industry, faceband can be another entertainment platform service with messengers integrated with augmented reality.Since we didn't have much time, we only made the process till announcing the winner. But if we could develop more, we think it would be fun if the winner could apply funny filters to the losers while they face chat and make some laughter.

This is useful for people who pick their children by car or walking.The school only need one  or more tablets or iPads to receive notifications and scan the codes of the parents cel phone. When scanning these codes, the school will generate a report containing information of the deliveries: child\'s name, who picked him up, at what time he left, what car or walking, and who delivered the child.Permissions can be given by parents to different people, they are called ""authorized""; every user has an unique code; that code will allow parents to give permissions so the ""authorized"" can pick his kids from school (this can be used when the kids are invited to make homework, have lunch, a party or playing in a friends house) There´s one app for parents, one app for school (both of them available for IOS and Android); and the master control that is operated by the general administrator and school administrators in a computer.

"Context.IO for Drupal &amp; Maildispenser.com","Build email apps in record time without coding","[9781, ""A fellow founder from the Belgian startup community asked me for help with his Context.IO Apps challenge submission. He is not a developer but he is an amazing hustler, so I decided to help him. From my own experience I know how hard it can be for a non-technical startup founder. That is why with my colleagues we built a Graphical UI for Context.IO in Drupal to help anyone who can click their way through a configuration screen make their own email applications.Potential impactThere are just under a 100 thousand users actively contributing to the Drupal project. With the Context.IO module it is now really easy for them to create email applications. We expect that the open sourced Context.IO module will have some or all of the following impact:Some of the sites that currently use Mailhandler will switch over to Context.IOSome of Drupal's 502 distributions (e.g. ticketing packages) will start including the Context.IO module into their downloadable packageSite builders will start using the Context.IO module in their new projectsAdministrators will develop email applications for their organisationsWhen you choose our submission for the competition you give us the funding to further promote it in the community.  "", 'Instead of making a single app, we wanted to create a platform on top of which other people, even non-developers could innovate. That\'s why we built a Drupal module that we\'ve open sourced. We\'ve also built an example implementation that uses the module to address 2 problems we had in our company.The Context.IO module lets you set up feeds in Drupal that will import emails, or data inside your emails into a site. To do so you don\'t need to write a single line of code. You can use our module to make applications that do any or a combination of the following:Import emails that fulfil certain criteria from your email archiveImport emails as they arrive in your mailboxExtract information from email bodies (this currently requires regular expressions, I guess that qualifies as code)Share this information with a selected group of trusted parties that get access to your siteDo certain actions (e.g. schedule, or send an email) when you receive an email that fulfils certain criteriaCreate users in your site every time you receive email from a new address, or when an email gets forwardedDrupal already has a module to import emails: Mailhandler. Drupal.org knows about 2,352 sites that currently use the module and it has been downloaded 62,105 times. The Context.IO module that we built however is superior over Mailhandler for the following reasons:Mailhandler doesn\'t provide options to search and filter emailsMailhandler\'s primary use case is to import mail as it arrives in a mailbox, not to process emails that have been archived.Mailhandler requires you to provide login credentials to the site, and can\'t currently request access using oAuth. As a result it\'s only really fit for single mailbox applications (e.g. a ""reply to"" comment on a forum). So not really for applications that consumers can grant access to their mailbox to.Drupal is one of the leading open source CMSs and is popular with a really large audience ranging from technically savvy consumers all the way through to enterprise organisations (e.g. https://www.whitehouse.gov/ runs on Drupal). While it is comparably easier to set up a Wordpress site, Drupal is more flexible. It\'s with this flexibility in mind that we built the Context.IO module.  ', ""The module is conceived as a building block, compatible with Drupal's massive ecosystem of modules. Since it's a module that implements the Feeds architecture, it allows site builders to configure:A fetcher that uploads emails that fulfil a set of search parameters A parser that extracts information from inside the email into separate fields, to store structured informationA processor that maps the information into native Drupal objects and their fields (e.g. nodes, users, comments) "", ""Overall the API was easy to use, but we had some difficulties with the implementation of the attachment API. We've filed a bug for it on the GitHub project. In the beginning there were some synching issues with my inbox, because of which we couldn't fully test the body import function.Accomplishments that we are proud ofWe've finished the Context.IO module in under 2 weeks.The site that we use in the demo video was built in less than 4 hours.The module is really powerful and plays nice with Drupal's contrib modules. We are really excited about it's potential.In 5 days we had 85 downloads for the module, and it's already reported in use on 3 sites. This is really fast adoption, that I haven't previously seen in my 10 year long Drupal carreer.What we learnedWe had a dependency bug with the Context.IO library and our developers had to freshen up their knowledge about dependency management with libraries in Drupal.Prototyping in Drupal goes really fast and is super fun (I guess that wasn't really news, for us at least)What's next for the Context.IO Drupal moduleWe've published a blogpost about the competition and the module to the Planet Drupal (an RSS feed for the Drupal community). We will be following up with another post about the demo video (also here attached). We'll do another video that is targeted at site builders.We would like to talk with the Context.IO team about community outreach programs in the Drupal communityWe want to still implement attachment handlingWe want to set up a beta invite signup page to check for interest for the prototype that we built. We believe there might be interest for it as a customisable B2B solution.Maildispenser demo implementationSelectively share emailMaildispenser is an application that helps people selectively share emails. With it you can set up filters that will automatically upload emails into an online archive space. Each archive space can be shared with a group of people of your choice. With it, you no longer need to forward your emails or give access to your mailbox. Access permissions are granular: other people only get to see the emails they need, and when they no longer need access you can revoke their permissions. Unlike the native gmail filters that will only forward when they arrive to your inbox, Maildispenser can also help you share old emails. Invoice sharingEarlier this year my assistant who helps me processing my expenses went on pregnancy leave. In the past years I had set up a large number of email filters in Gmail that forwarded invoices to her, now I not only had to redo those filters, I also had to forward a number of invoices that hadn’t been processed yet. If you work with one assistant this is a bit of a hassle, if you work with a number of different people from odesk for example, this can be enough hassle to undue whatever time savings you made using an admin in the first place. You could maybe solve the problem if you forward these mails to a separate mailbox, but then you have to keep changing your credentials for it.With Maildispenser, you can set up a space for your invoices, you can either define a catch all filter, that will upload any email that mentions the word invoice. Or you could define individual filters that only upload emails that originate from a certain address and have a specific type of title, to upload invoices from each of your vendors separately. Once the system is set up you can then give your assistant access to your invoice space. When they are finished with the job, you can revoke their permissions.Email archiveA few months ago we fell out with a customer, as a pre-seed startup they had run out of money. They threatened us with a law suit and played other tricks to try to make us do more and more work for ever shrinking amounts of money.

We believe there might be interest for it as a customisable B2B solution.Maildispenser demo implementationSelectively share emailMaildispenser is an application that helps people selectively share emails. With it you can set up filters that will automatically upload emails into an online archive space. Each archive space can be shared with a group of people of your choice. With it, you no longer need to forward your emails or give access to your mailbox. Access permissions are granular: other people only get to see the emails they need, and when they no longer need access you can revoke their permissions. Unlike the native gmail filters that will only forward when they arrive to your inbox, Maildispenser can also help you share old emails. Invoice sharingEarlier this year my assistant who helps me processing my expenses went on pregnancy leave.

"sizeOf","Precision real world measurements using just a mobile phone camera","[1971, ""The idea for sizeOf came about when Davis saw how much data his DSLR camera gave for his pictures. Using some simple trig we are able to deduce the size of real life object using nothing but the data from the camera and computation. How it worksWith only a picture and some information about the camera and lens, we are able to calculate the approximate real height and width of an object in focus.  Simply point the camera at an object, tap to focus, and drag a crop box around the object of interest to get the real size of that object, in meters.The math is derived from lens formulae and some simple trigonometry.  Challenges I ran intoEvery camera is different, and almost every variable is non-linear.  This makes creating solutions difficult.

"XLTools Suite for Excel","Indispensable Excel apps you need daily – in a single tab.","[5175, 'In our team, we have been using Excel for years. At some point we decided to share our know-hows. That is how XLTools add-in was born. Initially we created it as a VSTO-based add-in written in C#. The product became very successful. So far, XLTools has been downloaded 167,000 times and installed on 45,000 unique PCs across 146 countries.However, VSTO work only on Windows. That is why we were so exited when new the cross-platform JavaScript API appeared. We implemented a subset of the most successful tools from our VSTO add-in and made them cross-platform and mobile friendly. But JavaScript API 1.0 had some limitations:VSTO add-in had a custom tab in the ribbon UI, while the new apps were ""hidden"" on the ""Insert"" tabThere was no way to build  single suite of tools, same as we had built with VSTOWith the JavaScript API 1.1 it all changed. We were very excited with the possibility to create custom tabs and add-in commands for the Excel ribbon UI as well as the ability for central deployment. We decided to build XLTools Suite - an app that bundled all our tools into a single tab. ', 'No matter expert or beginner, XLTools Suite are Excel apps you can actually use daily. Within a single app you get:Calendar - dates editing in Excel made easy. As it always had to be. This useful date picker makes date entry and formatting super simple. Data Cleaning - clean bulk data in a few clicks: redundant spaces, line breaks or non-printing symbols, change text case, etc. Unpivot Table  - redesign crosstab, or 2D tables to a flat list in Excel quickly and accurately. SQL Queries - run SQL queries in Excel and directly against Excel tables: SELECT, JOIN, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, WHERE, SUM, etc. Export to CSV  - convert Excel tables or selected ranges to plain text CSV with custom delimiter and without closing the primary Excel file. Columns Match - match columns against each other or benchmarks and calculate the exact match percentage. Creation of XLTools Suite is truly beneficial for end-users. Instead of adding each app separately, the entire set is added at once, and all tools are readily available from one tab. As developers of productivity apps, we appreciate every possibility to reduce the number of steps required from the end user. We believe productivity begins with the inner drive to do every little thing just a bit easier!How to try itWhile XLTools Suite is under review and not yet available in the AppSource, you can try it as a side loaded add-in. Here is what you need to do:Download and save XLTools Suite Manifest fileLog in to your Office365 account: https://portal.office.comOpen Excel Online and create a new document or download our sample documentOn the Excel ribbon go to Insert -> Office Add-ins -> Click Upload My Add-in (right top corner) -> Select XLTools Suite Manifest file and click ""Upload""Now you should see new ""XLTools"" tab on you Excel ribbon. Enjoy!Note: Due to limitations of the current API (read the next section) the ""Calendar"" button will not insert the calendar pane itself yet, it will open the calendar app page on AppSource instead.Challenges we ran intoWhile add-in commands support task pane apps, they do not yet support content pane apps yet.What\'s next for XLTools SuiteWe have submitted XLTools Suite to AppSource and waiting for it to be publishedWe will continue to migrate most successful tools from our VSTO add-in to XLTools SuiteWe would like to improve our marketing and sales in corporate sector, we hope Hack Productivity 3 and Microsoft can help us with itBuilt Withazurecsshtml5javascriptoffice-js-apioffice-ui-fabricoffice365resttypescriptTry it outgoo.gl      Submitted to    Hack Productivity 3Winner                Best Office 365 Add-in                  Created by  I worked on the script for the promo video and some of the materials for the submission.Maria BalobanovaI helped to develop UI for Mac version.

"Automation for JIRA","The simple way to automate your team!","[4997, ""We wanted to make it easy for JIRA customers to automate their teams' processes.  Current solutions all require deep knowledge of JIRA's APIs or some developer skills to write scripts.  Not all JIRA admins have those skills nor do they want to spend time learning them. Our inspiration was to provide a simple, yet incredibly powerful user experience that hides all the complexity from the user.  We also want to make it easier to integrate JIRA with third party systems. "", ""Automation for JIRA allows any project admin to create powerful automation rules in their project with ease.  At its heart is a simple rule builder that allows users to specify triggers, conditions and actions.  Triggers control when an automation rule begins - they can react to issue events or be scheduled. With conditions project admins can customise rules to only run for issues they care about.  Finally actions perform changes in a system, such as editing an issue, creating sub-tasks or sending SMS notifications via Twilio.Users can combine as many conditions and actions as they like.   We provide some pre-defined templates and on-boarding to help you get started, but the power is really with users to combine automation rule components in exciting new ways!We also offer a free 'Lite' version of Automation for JIRA that's limited to 60 rule executions per month so customers can try it out for as long as they like! Upgrades to the paid version will be seamless with all rules still being there after upgrade. "", 'We built Automation for JIRA on a serverless stack using AWS Lambda, API Gateway and Cloudfront for static resources.  Dynamic parts of the UI are served directly via API Gateway, which makes calls to Lambda to render the initial connect page contents and provides REST resources to fetch and update additional data.  When automation rules execute, they are added to a AWS Kineses queue that is also processed by AWS Lambda.The front-end was built using React and Redux and can be run completely standalone. In fact most of our front-end development was done on a local webpack dev-server using mock REST data. ', ""Getting the initial serverless stack setup with AWS Cloudformation proved trickier and more time consuming than we thought. We investigated several solutions like serverless but couldn't find something that fit so we ended up building our own stack.  Cloudformation coupled with Cloudfront can be very time consuming with every small configuration change sometimes taking 20 mins to run.  On the product side, getting the design of the rule builder right was also very challenging and took a number of iterations to get right.  "", ""Nick and I are both very happy with the final design of the rule builder.  It's incredibly simple, yet very powerful.  We've also added an in product on-boarding tour that should make it very easy for our users to get started with Automation for JIRA.On the technical side we are both proud of the React, Redux, AWS Lambda stack we've developed.  The front-end will make it easy to port this add-on to server in the future and the cloud back-end stack will be an incredibly cost-effective way to host this add-on. "", 'Working on this add-on taught us a lot about the AWS stack and developing a scalable cloud add-on.  We were worried that we could not achieve a fast development speed using this very new serverless Lambda stack.  After a few teething problems with syncing incremental Lambda updates however and our standalone React/Redux front-end stack these fears proved to be unfounded. ', ""We ask for customer feedback directly in the product in a number of places.  With our infrastructure adding more integrations is now incredibly simple and we'll be able to respond to these customer suggestions within a couple of days and build a more fully featured product that will hopefully delight customers!We also want to add more third party integrations to really open up JIRA to other systems in use out there.

"AgriWave: Transforming the Agricultural and Data World","Making waves in the agricultural industry one data set at a time","[8006, ""AgriWave: We're here to deliver a product that connects the agricultural and data digital world using core technologies in modeling and data analytics to enable a variety of consumers to improve productivity, quality, safety, and sustainability. The agricultural industry is valued at $1.3 trillion USD annually, we can work to foster greater agricultural trade with the increase in population and demand for food to come. "", 'AgriWave is a software to transform a broad range of industries such as agriculture and logistics to understand data thoroughly for an economic, efficient, and effective agricultural analyses.We utilize FreeWave technologies in developing countries for the agricultural industries. Freewave can be used in developing countries to gather data on the big three crops: soybeans, corn, and wheat. We focus on irrigation water, electrical energy, dissolved salts, and soil reaction in growing these crops. Irrigation is a vital component of agricultural production, particularly in developing countries. With food production increasing in response to the demands of an expanding population and rising prosperity, irrigated agriculture continues to consume and be the largest user of water in all regions of the world. Agriculture accounts for 93% of water consumption worldwide. The agriculture sector is often criticized for high wastage and inefficient use of water at the point of consumption encouraged by subsidized low charges for water use or low energy tariffs for pumping. We need to understand our water usage for economic, environmental, and ethical purposes.Agriculture is an energy-intensive industry. Agriculture requires energy for important input in production, using energy directly as fuel or electricity to operate machinery and equipment, heat or cool buildings, for lighting on the farm, and indirectly in the fertilizers and chemicals produced off the farm. As farm production becomes more mechanized, the agricultural industry requires timenly energy supplies at particular stages of the production cycle to achieve optimum yields. We need to understand our electrical energy usage for maximum economic and environmental benefits.Water used for irrigation can vary greatly in quality depending upon type and quantity of dissolved salts. These salts originate from dissolution or weathering of the rocks and soil and carried with the water to wherever it is used. Salt content increasing causes severe toxicity, restricting crop yield. We need to understand and evaluate water quality related to salinity, water infiltration rate, and toxicity for greatest economic gain.Plants can tolerate a wide pH range in solution culture, but they cannot tolerate a wide range of acidity in the soil. Soil acidity is volatile and often changes, in turn changing the solubility of a number of metal ions. Plant growth is reliant on these varying concentrations of metals in solution rather than the acidity itself. The aim in managing soil pH is not to achieve a particular pH value, but to adjust the acidity to the point where there are no toxic metals in solution and the availability of nutrients is at its maximum. We need to understand the soil reaction and pH level for maximum economic gain.The weight of crops are important not only to see the growth but also to detect unwanted objects. Being able to sense the weight of a part of crop field and seeing a spike in weight is a sign of potential trespassing and vandalism, an all too common issue in the agricultural industry. We need to see the weight of crops not only for economic gain but for vandalism purposes as well to ensure security and safety of the agricultural industry. ', ""With a lot of help from caffeine, we used Laravel's PHP framework to build a full stack web application that can analyze and display hypothetical data from developing country farmland potentially using FreeWave radios. We used n3 charts to create a consumer friendly data analysis page where one can see varying farm data to keep track and understand what exactly is going on. "", 'For half of our team, this was our first Hackathon and we had no idea what to expect. We spent the first few hours going through many different ideas and getting overwhelmed with everything. Laravel, the main component of our project, was also completely new to most of us.  ', ""We are super excited to be able to apply our learned academic skills in addition to those we just learned on the spot today for real life applications in the world's largest industry.  "", 'In general, the whole concept of a Hackathon was new to us, and we learned how the entire process works. Throughout our project creation process, we started from step one where we went through several ideas and learned how to rule out projects and create outlines quickly due to the time restriction.

"Nimbus","Une flotte d'autobus intelligents à la demande.","[3493, ""Étant un groupe d'étudiants dans une ville aussi active que Montréal, il nous est souvent arrivé de nous retrouver dehors, tard le soir, sans plus aucun métros en circulation. Le moyen le plus économique, pour de modestes étudiants est donc le réseau de nuit de la STM (Société des Transports de Montréal). Malheureusement les arrêts desservis par ce réseau spécial sont très irréguliers, et il nous est souvent arriver d'attendre plus de 30min, dans le froid, en pleine nuit, à un arrêt. C'est de cette souffrance qu'est née notre idée de Nimbus.Nimbus, qu'est-ce que c'est?Nimbus c'est une flotte de véhicules au concept novateur, en effet, au lieu d'avoir des trajets fixes comme il se fait actuellement, la flotte de véhicule Nimbus se dispatchent de manière synchrone en prenant des trajets non fixés préalablement mais qui dépendent de la demande des utilisateurs. Les trajets sont recalculés en temps réel en permanence pour offrir une trajectoire en tout temps optimale, limitant ainsi le temps d'attentes des usagers! Comment l'a-t-on fait?Pour mettre sur pieds Nimbus, nous avons mis au point une web app qui sert de vitrine pour le system de monitoring de la flotte. Nous avons programmé tout le back-end en Python à l'aide du framework Django, pour la partie front-end, Javascript/ReactJS ont su faire le boulot pour le niveau de dynamisme dont nous avions besoin.Nos defisOn a dû attaquer le fameux « travelling salesman problem » pour trouver les trajectoires les plus efficaces incluant les points d’embarquement et de descente. Cet algorithme, grand classique de sa catégorie nous a causé bien du fil à retordre, tant bien même que nous nous sommes, après plusieurs heures à essayer d'implémenter notre prople solution, résolu à passer par un API qui nous a permi de faire abstraction des notions de maths poussés conduisant à sa résolution. Ainsi, nous avons pu nous consacrer à d'autres problématiques que l'API ne prenait pas en compte et dont nous avons dû construire le business logic pour mener à bien notre projet. Nos accomplissementsOn est extrêmement fiers du résultat final! On a finalisé une web app capable de calculer la meilleure trajectoire en fonction des besoins de tous les passagers en recevant les coordonnées GPS du passager ainsi que de sa destination comme input.L'experience qu'on en a tiréEn n'ayant que 24h à travailler sur un problème aussi ambitieux on a surtout appris à gérer notre temps en fonction de nos priorités (et oui, on a appliqué l'algorithme d'optimisation sur nous même finalement). En effet, notre idée de base était beaucoup plus vaste et comportait beaucoup plus de fonctionnalités, mais faute de temps, nous avons dû éliminer celles qui ne nous aurait pas forcément bénéficier sur le court-terme. Et pour aprèsNimbus a le potentiel d’améliorer la qualité de service offert par la société de transport de Montréal d’une manière significative. Après avoir introduit leur passagers à ce système pour les autobus de nuits, la STM pourrait proposer ce type de service pour tous les autobus en dehors des heures de pointe, ce qui leur permettra de fournir un service de meilleure qualité tout en étant efficaces et économiques.Built Withamazon-web-servicesapihtml5javascriptnginxpythonreacttspTry it outwww.github.com      Submitted to    Hackatown    Created by  Kevyn Bele-BindaMohamed CoulibaliIon Banaru "", ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['python', 'react', 'javascript', 'html5', 'amazon-web-services', 'tsp', 'nginx', 'api']","False","36","['ion4', 'freezky', 'konoufo']","https://firefly-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/usercontent/fill/242/161/cGhvdG9zL3Byb2R1Y3Rpb24vc29mdHdhcmVfdGh1bWJuYWlsX3Bob3Rvcy8wMDAvNDcwLzcyNi9kYXRhcy9vcmlnaW5hbC5qcGc=/devpost_7.jpg?signature=0d10e0534f73496fc4218b7c42f86a5be44c47d9","False","0"

"Taxicabs Mobility Challenge","Taking a cab in Morocco just got faster, cheaper, and safer ","[4821, 'We mostly got inspired from our journey taking cabs in Casablanca and how difficult, costly and frustrating it may be, we tried to memorize as much memories as we can and write down each type of difficulty we had, then we moved on to actually doing some brainstorming to put ideas and features together, so we took a look at some well known apps on the market and we tried to understand the importance of each feature they put and how they put it, then we finished by having some chit chat with taxi drivers to get as much insights as possible to really build an app that can benefit them in a daily basis as well. ', ""Our app is being built with one thing in mind, making life of passengers and taxi drivers as easy as it can be, so we went from giving passengers the ability to order a taxi with just a few clicks anytime, everywhere they are, to actually start saving money and taking cost efficient rides by either joining other people's ride or create their own and share it with other people to join.In the other hand, the driver has pretty much the same benefits, saving time by taking scheduled rides with just a few clicks without the hassle of phone calls and picking up passengers that already exist in the current zone, without forgetting the possibility of the system making you more money doing just that.All of this is backed up with an inner rating system for passengers and drivers to make sure you are in safe hands by having the ability to check someone's reputation.How i built itWe build it with the Ionic framework, it's a front-end SDK for building cross-platform mobile apps, which means that this app can be run on android as well as ios phones, Ionic also provides a platform for integrating services like push notifications and analytics. I chose to use NoSql with Mongodb server in order to get queries as fast as possible, and i'm using Node.js on the server side of the application, which can support an incredible number of network communication synchronously.Challenges i ran intoThe features that we had in mind to implement is numbered in comparison with the time we had in hands.Testing the app looking for bugs took a lot of time than expected.Fitting a well demonstrative script of quite a lot features in less than 5 min in a video was a bit challenging for us.Accomplishments that i'm proud ofThis is our first competition, so we were really excited about it and we're really proud of our accomplishment because in any case, we'd always feel that we actually tried to make somebody's life out there easier and that feeling for us is priceless.What i learnedWe learned that a lot of things can seem easy to implement but it takes up a lot of your time and energy, so you need to have some risk management for your project to deliver it in due time without having a negative impact on quality work, we also learned some stress controlling techniques that we enforced our bodies and mind to apply due having tons of work to do in the development period as 1 person as full stack developer and 1 person as a professional digital marketer and designer.Whats next for Ford Code for TaxiCabs Mobility Challenge:We are really excited and looking forward to get more engaged in the upcoming challenges and we sincerely thank everyone that put any kind of work in this to make it happen.Built Withionicnode.jsTry it outplay.google.complay.google.com      Submitted to    Ford Code for Taxicabs Mobility ChallengeWinner                SUPINFO Scholarship Award                  Created by  I worked in the back-end using nodejs, and in the front-end with angularjs and the Ionic framework, it was my first time using Ionic, which was a little intimidating, but I learned a TON about mobile developement.Abdelhakim LahrachA highly motivated and hard-working individual.

"CubeBot ","Size and Speed Optimized Rubik's Cube Solving Robot","[2871, 'Boredom ', ""Solves cubes autonomously.How We built itHundreds of hours of Solidworks, Python, Arduino, gluing, and staring at a 3D printer extruder.Other than the previously mentioned Pi and Arudino and glue, we also used 9 servo motors (RIP 1 servo motor due to incorrect wiring), duct tape, tears, and PLA. Other tools used but not included were scissors and a file. The file proved to be very useful due to our subpar 3D printer. The programming was done in C, Python, and the Arduino IDE. Basically what happens is Python is used to determine the colors of the cube using OpenCV, a C program solves the cube using Kociemba's Algorithm, and a Python program converts the output of the C program to an optimized move order specific to our hardware. The move sequence is then passed  to the Arduino, which assigns servo rotation sequences to each move, does a bit of turning, and solves the cube.The C implementation of the Kociemba Algorithm was primarily acquired from online sources however a few modifications were added to fit our design.Challenges We ran intoIn order to minimize volume, we made all the hardware as compact as possible. This required extensive thought when designing 3D printed components in Solidworks, and it became especially difficult when optimizing camera position. In order to have the device wireless and completely self contained, we utilized a Raspberry Pi camera, which unfortunately has a field of view of less than 50 degrees. In order to scan an entire side of the cube, the camera had to be mounted in a hole drilled beneath the cube with special lighting surrounding it. Additionally, software modification was necessary to slightly shift the cube in order to accurately view all nine cubelets. Also, our 3D printer was, you could say, not good. Printing parts took many many attempts and many, many hours. In the end, however, it seems like it works. Thank you super glue.What we are proud ofWe are very proud of CubeBot's small figure, minimal cost, and ability to solve a cube quickly. The entire project cost around $150, while starter Lego Mindstorm kits start at $400. And our best analysis and solve time is 35s.What We learnedPrototyping hardware projects requires a lot of time, especially when 3D printed components are utilized. The 3D printed components were critical for this project, however, in order to make custom fitting components. Also, before this, we did not have much experience with OpenCV, so that was fun.What's next for CubeBotCubeBot now lives on a shelf and has a dim future.

And now with the advent of the world of IoT devices it has never been easier or more accessible to start such a project. However we don't all have the knowledge, experience or even desire to spend time and effort on building dashboards and tools to interact with our IoT devices, sensors and other hardware. So we wanted to provide a way for any IoT project to get set up with a quick web/mobile visualisation as easily as possible.

', ""We worked as team with each member focussing on their strengths and stronger areas of knowledge. We decided to write our code using as many of the newest features as possible with Meteor. This meant choosing Angular for the front end dashboards which now has excellent support in Meteor. In addition we made a conscious effort to write all code in as much of an 'es6/ecmascript2015' style as possible with the new support in the framework. For our first proof of concept we used a Particle (previously known as Spark) Core IoT device which was in turn connected up to a temperature sensor for real time data capture. The intention was to add more devices and sensors as quickly as possible. Our application design implemented a user flow for adding new devices to their accounts and profiles. Once a device and it's authentication details had been added to the platform our IoThingies application can immediately start querying this device for any methods, variables or data sets which may be available for collection and inspection.

"ShortStock","ShortStock uses ML neural networks to filter and customise news releases about companies to varied investing styles","[6881, ""Investing is an art, not a science. In global money flow markets dictated by growth and value investing, individuals often look at a myriad of non-financial news updates beyond financial analytics of a company on issues including management, innovation, and expansion to guide decision-making. But, not all investors have the same principles or styles even when looking at similar firms: thus, while generic updates can be found by the Google Engine or NASDAQ, there exists a deep information asymmetry since it is difficult to find tailored relevant news that truly affect a specific individual's cognitive processes. Thus, we were inspired to build a full-stack application that displays news reports to an investor and which, based on user feedback (relevant/not relevant), continuously 'learns' investor's style to better present relevant articles about a firm to aid investing activities. "", ""ShortStock essentially creates a customized news feed of investing-relevant developments surrounding a company to best support an individual investor. Its web interface takes a company ticker as input and passes it through Google News API to find recent articles. The code help scrape news reports into lists of important phrases, then compared to a keyword database to find most relevant tags/categories for each article. These tags are subsequently inputted into our machine learning algorithm which uses previous data sets to determine whether the investor is likely to find the article relevant (and hence must be displayed) or not. Quick summaries and URLs of the relevant chosen articles are then based back to the investor on the webpage. Each article is accompanied by radio buttons for the investor to determine helpful/ not helpful which then updates the ML algorithm's training set for more optimized future results.  "", 'The application first renders an interface webpage built on Bootstrap (HTML, CSS) to take the ticker input. Control in the program is passed to a central flask code (running on a local flask server) that receives data by POST. Using modules in file structure, the code calls Google News API and runs article URLs through BeautifulSoup and Diffbot Article API to find the aforementioned list of main phrases. Our database handling downloads keyword dictionary by SQL and then uses a matching algorithm in O(n2) to compare each phrase to the entire dictionary. The frequency-of-occurence for each tag determines the final relevant category for the article, which the flask server then passes to our ML neural network. Using multi-layer perceptron that trains using backpropagation and LBFGS, we use the Cross-Entropy loss function and in-built regularization functions to create a \'usefulness matrix\' of binary values. The output of relevance binaries is then mapped to the article list to dump our relevant reports onto, and render, the final HTML page. The user\'s submission of ""helpful""/""not helpful"" on the final page passes control back to the Flask server to run SQL queries that add said new entries to the the investor\'s specific training dataset on the database for future use.  ', 'While our code functioned effectively as individual components (database management, algorithm design, API and front-end), integrating them into a full stack with the flask interface turned out to be our singular defining problem through the hackathon. There were often inconsistencies across the data types and models that were used, making the internal transfer of control and information difficult. This integration issues were exasperated by difference in versions of softwares as well as difference in syntax across the programming languages combined in the stack. Furthermore, we also experienced issues in adjusting the dimensionality of our neural network input and the time complexity of our relevance algorithm (we had to restrict our articles to 7 to ensure manageable speed).  ', 'Over the entire duration of our hackathon, we were proud of having addressed our integration issues in achieving an efficient flow of control across the program stack for seamless input and data transfer. We are also proud of having learnt, implemented and debugged an entire new language - Flask - over the course of just this hackathon since it was an integral part of our project.

Firstly, we would improve run-time complexity of our major algorithms, including ML, API reading and web-scraping in order to accommodate more articles into a manageable time frame. We would also use a larger training set for our neural network to improve predictive accuracy, along with support for multiple tags for each article (such that information can belong at the very intersections of a matrix than simply categories).

We separated into two teams - one team focused on the bot, and another focused on the native application.

"planet.AR.y","An immersive augmented reality experience paired with Alexa to engage and teach kids about our solar system!","[8734, 'Ever since we were young children, we wanted to explore the universe as we both had a common passion for space and astronomy. Originally, we thought of creating a voice driven skill that took advantage of Amazon’s Alexa Voice Service that told stories to children. However, we realized there were two essential flaws with this idea. The first was that stories required little to no user interaction and we really wanted to harness the potential of using voice with Amazon Alexa. The second main flaw was that as humans, we are better visual learners than we are auditory (nearly 7 times more)!  To solve this, we created a dynamic augmented reality experience that immerses children in a new environment and helps them learn about the solar system and satisfy their curiosity. ', 'Users can download and launch the app which will be available on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store. The app presents an augmented reality interface and projects a window into the solar system using the rear camera of the device. The skill then interfaces with this app and allows users to ask questions about the planet they are looking at, including its distance to the sun, some brief information about the planet, and more interesting details.  ', 'The process of building this application was quite tedious and challenging, but it can be broken up into various modules.Load Unity and Vuforia and create models of all the planets with an ImageTarget that maps the planets to each other and a reference frame.Create an Alexa Skill in the Skill Builder portal and define the interaction models as well as the intent schema. This sets up the framework for the behavior of our skill.Create a Node.JS server that interfaces with the Amazon Alexa and translates the various intents into requests that can be passed on.Create another intermediary server that interfaces with both the Unity application and the Alexa skill by using HTTP requests to pass data between the phone and Alexa. Deploy the Node.JS servers onto a cloud based platform service such as Heroku that can run web apps from a stable and fast server.Step 1: Create a Unity application using VuforiaThe first step is to install Unity with the Vuforia package which allows for the creation of augmented and virtual reality apps. On the Vuforia website, you can generate a database with an image target that renders your content on top of a specified image, which it uses as a reference point. In this case, we used a picture of a rocketship to go along with the space theme.  Next, we had to download 3D models of all planets and position them accurately relative to each other. Step 2: Building the Alexa SkillThe next step was to create the skill in the Alexa Skill builder. We had to write out all the utterances for our skill and define the intent schema in order to create the backbone of our skill. This was fairly straightforward as it takes you step by step through the process. Step 3: The NodeJS Alexa Facing SkillWe decided not to use Lambda and instead create our own custom HTTP server that interfaces with the Amazon Echo. To do so, we used Node.JS and Express as well as a variety of other modules to make this task simpler. The server handles a variety of intent requests and returns a response after sending an HTTP request to the middle server which will be discussed in the next step.Step 4: The Intermediary ServerIn order to link the Alexa skill to the Unity application, we created another HTTP server that acted as a bridge between the phone and Unity application. The server sent HTTP requests to the Unity Application, which then responded with the nearest planet relative to the camera using a custom C# script. The server also responds to the Alexa Skill Server.Step 5: Deploying to HerokuWe decided to deploy our Node.JS servers on heroku in order to give it a static url as well as ensure that our servers stayed up. You have to create a file called Procfile.txt, and inside type:web server.jsThen, it’s as simple as posting the project on a Github repository and setting Heroku up to follow any commits made in that repository.How to use itEnable the Alexa Skill by asking Alexa to enable Reality Planets.Download the companion app from the link below or from the link Alexa will send to your phone.Ask Alexa to pair your phone and enter the code it gives you in the app you downloaded.Open the image down below on another device or print it out.Use the app to point at the picture and display the planets.Ask Reality Planets about the planet to get information about it. ', 'Unity does not support hosting an HTTP server that can handle incoming requests and it was extremely difficult to transfer information between the phone and the intermediary server.To establish a link between the Unity application and the Alexa skill, we needed a way to know which instance of the app was making requests in order to delivery information to the correct device.We had trouble with Unity resolving some Vuforia components, preventing us from working on multiple computers and merging our changes.When creating 3D models of all the planets, we had trouble resolving their textures and did not know how to create .mat (material) files that could be used.During testing we had issues using a tunneling reverse proxy (ngrok) as it repeatedly crashed and was unstable for our uses.The C# environment that Unity uses caused us some troubles as we had never used it previously.Our Heroku requests often failed because the servers were set to fall asleep after a set time periodChallenge 1 Fix:We solved this by creating two different servers that could handle HTTP requests and allowed for the information from the Unity application (Planet) to be passed on to the Alexa skill. This was then processed through the various intents for each piece of information we wanted to deliver to the user (planet description, orbit time, diameter, and distance).Challenge 2 Fix:We used a server to bridge Alexa and the app in order to generate a unique UID that paired both of them in their own isolated instance. Alexa creates a one time alphanumeric seven character sequence that it then prompts the user to enter. This initiates a link between the two.Challenge 3 Fix:We were forced to use only one computer to run Unity on as it would compile properly on others.Challenge 4 Fix:We fixed this issue by learning how to convert satellite jpg or png images into that specific file type so that the .obj files would accept them as an overlay and so the planets would appear in color.Challenge 5 Fix:We deployed to Heroku to mitigate the issues we had with ngrok.Challenge 6 Fix:We learned the nuances of the language and restarted Unity which fixed a lot of the issues.Challenge 7 Fix:We used a Heroku App called Kaffeine to ping it every 30 minutes and keep it always running. ', 'We learned how to interface Unity and Alexa, which was very tricky and can help in future projects.We gained mastery of HTTP requests and NodeJS, as there were a lot of moving parts and requests that needed to be routed properly.A lot of the code for the servers and Unity can be repurposed for augmented reality applications that require connection to other platforms.Creating apps that work on other important platforms. We learned how to create an iOS app using Xcode for the first time.VUI Design for the Alexa Skill + Unity Application and the Javascript servers involved ', 'How to make a great Alexa skill that is accessible to all children and being able to provide a new way to learn about planets that was unique and not previously integrated with a voice platform. We also learned about the various hurdles that needed to be overcome to build a successful skill. ', 'We hope to add different planets, moons, solar systems, and animate various orbits.

"Planet Ally: Travel Agents of Change","Informing and empowering LGBTIQ and allies about the travel choices they make.","[14922, 'The planet, as a global community, needs people working together as allies to create forward progress. It is in this shared togetherness that I want to create a tool(s) of empowerment that helps users make informed choices.Simply being gay doesn’t automatically make someone aware of their rights in countries they travel. Allies often learn something later and say, “I had no idea, if I had known I would have made a different decision.” It is exactly these kinds of reactions that made me realize I want to find ways to activate awareness and allyship from within our global community.  It is both the LGBTIQ person and the well-intentioned ally who need easily distributable tools of empowerment to help them make choices that are right for them. In targeting both groups simultaneously I want to support our global community in becoming a Planet of Allies.As a social media activist and specialist, I have instinctively started to crowd source this idea and have created a Global Advisory team, made up of amazing thought leaders and activists to help me best work through the labyrinth of opportunities and challenges as we embark on this journey. ', 'Planet Ally, in its first iteration, is a mobile friendly website, that focuses on travel and the LGBTIQ, with a particular focus on allyship and solidarity. Planet Ally empowers LGBTIQ and allies to make informed travel decisions. It arms travellers with the information they need to make decisions that are right for them based on their own views and values.

We knew that would be hard but had hoped to attract developers and coders a lot earlier in the process.As we are in our infancy in the tech/hack space a big challenge was knowing how to even articulate what we want to do and achieve. We were fortunate enough 4 days out to find the most amazing and tirelessly committed word press guy in Kenton!Naturally with a team across the globe, and me having to travel in the middle made it difficult but the team were so committed and motivated, I was humbled to see how far they have gone and how much they have put into this. We are a leaderful team and that was key when we handed over from HK, New Jersey and Sydney!We used @slackhq throughout and it was very helpful keeping us in touch and on track. We tried to reach out to seek more support from the LGBTIQ travel community but alas our deadline was just too tight.  We have limited skills as a team in design and coding so that has taken much time, we would hope moving forward we could benefit from having quality production but hope our work is still able to convey the larger vision that we have re coding and production value etc.Another challenge given Planet Ally is so information-driven was access to updated information from NGOs and official government websites etc. We used tweets and DMs both on Twitter and Facebook to crowd source information and access to data and reports etc.Going forward I would like to take the time to verify information and accuracy with trusted local partners, consulting with our global advisory and conducting interviews on the ground etc.Overall, we tackled a big project with a large scope, over 3 continents, so consistently raining in and focusing on making something that worked and was presentable was hard, but we did it! I am so proud of every one of our team, who absolutely went above and beyond and now are all keen to take Planet Ally to the next step! ', ""Personally, I'm an out Australian expat rainbow Mum and professional activist living in Hong Kong. My wife flies as a Captain for Cathay Pacific. We travel a lot, especially for our youngest son's medical appointments (he has cochlear implants and is going blind). Being an out woman, being a mother, being an expat, being a traveller, being an activist, being a professional networker – I wear a lot of hats and I’ve become a member of a lot communities.I'm proud that I have been able to have a concept that has resonated and enabled me to gain support and commitments from some of my favourite and most influential global activists and thought leaders. Before the Hack4Equality came along Planet Ally was something I was talking about this idea but not acting upon it, truth be told I was overwhelmed as to how to even kick off!It's incredible in such a short space in time to have the support and the ear of VIPs like: Geena Rocero (Gender Proud) Matt Beard (All Out) , Lia Parifax (Arcus and Athlete Ally), Nigerian activist Bisi Alimi, LGBTI academic Lee Badgett, MTV Genderqueer star Jacob Tobia, Swedish activist and technologist Nadia Zabehi and to my shock and delight Indian Prince Manvendra to name a few. I'm turning 40 in a few weeks and I have been passionate about wanting to make Planet Ally happen, I just didn't know how. I planned and still do plan to use using my birthday as a 'hack for human capital'. I will be walking all my friends – mums, dads, athletes, artists, activists, allies, you name it – through this first iteration of Planet Ally to gain as much insight, feedback and inspiration as possible. Creating and curating Planet Ally is the next phase in my activist career.       Hack4Equality is the most spectacularly serendipitous opportunity and I just can not thank all involved enough for the gift it's given my team and I to really think what about our hopes, vision and next steps are for Planet Ally.I am also thrilled we have built a platform that other apps and technologies could plug into (including fellow hackathon entries e.g. #Hack4Equality Turn Out app for volunteers) "", ""I have learned so much. I was overwhelmed by how to execute and how to update information - particularly safety issues and we didn't manage to address enough yet – but we managed to come up with a first iteration that begins to tease out my grandiose ideas into a functioning, practical, usable website. For future iterations, we need to have a better project management scope with deliverables and assigned tasks.Truthfully I was worried that I wasn't ready to share this in such a high-profile space BUT the opportunity to participate and learn from the incredible brains trust assembling for #Hack4Equality is a rare and incredible chance to bring Planet Ally to fruition!What's Next for Planet AllyWe want to address corporate spaces; regional and global travel mobility issues and especially those travelling overseas to work or considering relocating with their partner etc. We look forward to building some corporate partnerships and hoped to have had more on workplace travel on our site but simply ran out of time. We also intend to attract students who are travelling interstate or overseas and give them the best information and resources to make an informed decision.Our vision for the app and site is to enable users to navigate the site intersectionally via filter functions that allow you to self-identify according to gender, race, ethnicity, ability, family etcPlanet Ally seeks to be the world’s most influential and social media savvy group of professional LGBTIQ, ally activists, and other prominent thought leaders. Through these partnerships Planet Ally will create edgy and informative video content, curate content using a strong and engaging social media strategy, host online panels derived from our global network to educate and discuss country-specific issues, and provide relevant educational, news, and crowd sourced content. Planet Ally is a for-profit initiative social enterprise, but one that gives back to the communities and NGOs working for inclusion, diversity, and equality. We will also support vulnerable and volatile countries and regions who most need support and visibility. It will be a travel app that rather than focusing on fluffy pillows, mini bar contents or spa treatments, will focus on knowing your rights, evaluating attitudes and most importantly being clear on whether any money you spend ends up supporting regimes that are anti LGBTIQ.The app will provide information that clearly presents facts on destinations with information on laws, airline carriers, hotel groups, community organizations, social spaces, and so on, so app users can make informed travel choices while also knowing their rights are on the ground. It will aggregate data and distill information into an easy to understand rating system for both destinations, as well as, travel related businesses. It will present:Provide an ‘official view’ which will be based on law, policy, financial stakes, and so on. Provide a curated ‘View from the street’ which will be crowd-sourced opinion from the user-base.

"Free Feet","Improving mobility, one step at a time.","[6160, ""Free Feet treats gait freezing, a symptom which affects approximately 72% of people with Parkinson's. Every hour, someone in the UK is diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, showing just how large the scale of the problem I'm trying to treat is. The inspiration behind Free Feet came from when I was discussing treatments for Parkinson's patients, at  the kitchen table, with my brother, who is a movement disorders (Parkinson's) nurse. He said that there weren't many treatments available for gait freezing, so I decided to see what I could do to help. This is where the idea of Free Feet was born. I also have an emotional connection to Parkinson's as I have a neighbour who sufferers from the illness, so I knew the impact that both gait freezing, and Parkinson's can have on quality of life. This really inspired me to pursue and develop my idea, as there is no known cure for Parkinson's, finding new ways of treating it is really important.How it worksFree Feet treats gait freezing in Parkinson's Disease. It is a laser device attached to the side of a shoe which is designed to help reduce gait freezing for Parkinson's sufferers. Gait freezing is a very common symptom which affects approximately 72% of people with Parkinson's, it is a shuffling movement in the legs and feet. The laser places a red dot on the ground in front of the user. This then changes the users walking from being automatic to non-automatic. This is really important, as in Parkinson's, there is a deficiency in the neurotransmitter (chemical) dopamine. Dopamine is responsible for movement and muscular action, so when there's a deficiency in dopamine, reduced mobility also occurs. However, the midbrain is more severely affected than the frontal lobes. Free Feet works by enabling the user to change their walking from being automatic to non-automatic, when they focus on the dot. This is really important, as it means that the user employs the frontal lobes instead of the midbrain, meaning there is more dopamine available to them, and therefore more ability for movement to occur, thus decreasing the severity of the gait freezing episode. Small scale clinical trials, which we have carried out in collaboration with the Galway Parkinson's Association have shown very positive results, with an approximate decrease in freezing severity of 40%.Challenges I ran intoI have faced many challenges in the development of Free Feet, as being a young woman in STEM, I have always been in the minority of my peer group. I have faced the challenge of overcoming the barrier of youth, as in professional situations, such as networking events, it is hard to ensure that you and your ideas are taken seriously and that your work is appreciated for its full value. An example of this I like to share is a networking event which I attended recently, and because of my age, I was asked if I was looking for one of my parents. I thought that this was certainly a situation in which I was not being taken seriously, and overcame that challenge by explaining my presence and work. I have also faced the challenge of balancing my work and school life, whilst working on the development of Free Feet, I have completed the A-Level equivalent exams (Irish Leaving Certificate) and earned my first choice course in University (Biotechnology). I thought that this was quite a challenge, as I had to balance my time and resources very carefully, but it worked out for the better in the end!I also faced the challenge of learning the technical skills necessary to build the prototype of the device. Free Feet is a device which I built myself, at my kitchen table. In order to do this I needed to learn electronics, soldering and stitching skills, and they were quite the challenge to master!Accomplishments that I'm proud ofI'm very proud that I have successfully trialled a medical device which I created at my kitchen table, and have found that it could help reduce the severity of gait freezing by such a vast percentage.I'm really proud, that against the odds, and people telling me that it would not be possible, I've kept making progress with the commercialisation of my device. I'm very proud that I have recieved the backing of my national medical device association, the IMDA, and that they believed in me and my abilities enough to invest in my personal development.I'm also really proud that developing my device now means, that I have, at my fingertips, the potential to help millions of people around the world suffering from Parkinson's disease. I think that it is really fantastic to be able to reach out and help others through technology, and I'm immensely proud of what I have achieved thus far. I'm really proud of getting into the outbox incubator, its something that I never thought would have been possible for me to achieve, and I'm just delighted.I was really proud to get the opportunity to present Free Feet to our national minister for health, and to learn that he was very impressed with it was fantastic, he said that he hopes to see it in use in the very near future.What I learnedI learnt a lot about how a company works and how to properly forecast financial expenditure. I also learnt more about brand image and how to appropriatly convert that to the consumer. This has led to me being much more conscious regards the logo aand web presence of the business.What's next for Free FeetFree Feet now needs funds in order to be able to reach its full potential.

"RoboCop","Emergency Automated Silent Caller","[3463, 'Last week I was reading a newspaper when I came across a story about how two women were brutally beaten (one of whom eventually died) after a home invader found them hiding under a bed. When asked why she didn\'t call the police immediately, the women said she was scared if the phone made noise or if she talked too loud the intruder would hear and find them. This story was very unsettling, and after some research I found it wasn\'t a rare occurrence either. There are over 3 million home invasions and burglaries in the US every year, and nearly half of those invaders are lethally armed. These victims who were killed by invaders were people: they had lives, families, friends, and they should have had futures too. My goal was to find a way to stop these lethal situations from happening, and to save the lives of future victims.How it worksRoboCop allows a person to silently and quickly call emergency services without the need to speak or spend time dialing and then explaining the situation. Within seconds of opening the app the police are called and given your GPS coordinates. Any additional information you give the service, such as exact location in the building or your current situation, will be translated from text to speech using IBM\'s Watson and sent to the police station using IBM Bluemix and Twilio.Challenges I ran intoBoth the accuracy of location and sending out the call quickly were important to get emergency services to the user as rapidly as possible. Seconds can make the difference between life and death in some cases, and we had to ensure we could balance these two components to minimize response time. By allowing the app to send new information as it became available, rather than all at one time, we were able to allow near instant calling when the app is opened.Accomplishments that I\'m proud of & What I learnedBecause almost every emergency service call center in the US cannot receive text or non-audio information and home invasions are a real danger, we are proud that our app has the potential to save lives that might have otherwise been lost. I have never worked on an app before, and have mostly just worked in data science. Many of the components and steps in this project were completely new to me, but I didn\'t give up!What\'s next for RoboCopUsing a custom phone launcher, we hope to be able to add a ""stealth call"" feature that calls the police based off of a button click combination (ex.- power button clicked and then volume-up button clicked four times) so the service can be used without the use of a screen and while still in a person\'s pocket. This might be useful to those in situations where they need to call the police but cannot due to a person watching them such as during a mugging or a physically abusive relationship.Built Withandroidbluemixbootstrapcsshtml5ibm-watsoniosjavascriptphonegapsmartphonetwiliowindows-phone      Submitted to    HackUMassWinner                Communication Innovation Award              Winner                Finalist              Winner                Champion              Winner                IBM Bluemix Cloud Development Innovation Award                  Created by  Frontend, UX, presentation, etc..David NearyRhode Island and Massachusetts.

"best ethereum wallet ever","a secure local Ethereum wallet with hardware wallet support in Brave","[6747, 'As security geeks, we wanted a local Ethereum wallet with a small attack surface, a front-end easy enough for non-technical users to use securely, and hardware wallet support. None of the existing options met our needs; for instance:Mist still runs Chromium 54, which was released in April of last year, and thus is vulnerable to old Chromium vulnerabilities. In fact this caused them to issue a severe security alert recently: https://blog.ethereum.org/2017/12/15/security-alert-chromium-vulnerability-affecting-mist-browser-beta/. Furthermore Mist runs without Chromium\'s renderer sandbox, so many high-severity vulnerabilities in Chromium are actually critical vulnerabilities in Mist that can lead to full system compromise. Mist\'s advice is ""don\'t browse to untrusted websites"", but it\'s unclear that non-technical users can practically follow this advice, since Mist makes it easy to browse to untrusted websites in their Electron interface.MetaMask lacks hardware wallet support. https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/717wallet.ethereum.org is a remote website with poor XSS protection since it doesn\'t define a Content Security Policy. Furthermore, websites lack the same level of code integrity as apps since they are not signed/versioned and can be modified without detection by the server operator at any time. Thus an attacker only needs to compromise the wallet.ethereum.org web server in order to compromise its users\' wallets. In addition, websites are prone to phishing attacks.Same with MyEtherWallet, although they now have a Chrome extension. However, it\'s unclear whether to what extent the extension is stable or recommended. (See https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/issues/1406#issuecomment-352719852 for instance.)Parity runs a local web interface. This is a great approach but their app is not code-signed and previously on MacOS was downloaded over plain HTTP (https://github.com/paritytech/homebrew-paritytech/issues/65). It is also not the most friendly tool for non-technical users, since it requires downloading a command line tool (https://paritytech.github.io/wiki/Setup) and running terminal commands. This state of affairs was concerning to us. You shouldn\'t have to be a security expert in order to have a secure Ethereum wallet! ', ""We integrated an Ethereum wallet in Brave browser (https://brave.com). All you have to do is install Brave and flip a switch to get a secure, local Ethereum wallet.Features include:1-click wallet creationLaunch the wallet directly from the Brave toolbar1-click shortcut to transfer funds from the ETH wallet into Brave's builtin BAT walletKeys are only stored client-sideUses geth light sync by default, so you're synced in minutes (or even seconds if you're not on the ethdenver wifi).Supports hardware wallets like Ledger and TrezorUses a strict Content-Security-Policy to defend against XSS (no inline scripts except those that are hash-whitelisted, no remote connections except to https://min-api.cryptocompare.com https://mini-api.cryptocompare.com)All open sourceBrave is up-to-date with the latest upstream Chromium release and enables sandboxing on all platformsAutomatically watches BAT token contract "", 'We added three main new components to Brave:a geth binary, which is run as a subprocess of Brave. It is downloaded during the Brave build process.a slightly-modified version of the wallet.ethereum.org front-end (which is also used in Mist): https://github.com/ethereum/meteor-dapp-wallet. Our fork is published as an open-source NPM package from https://github.com/brave/meteor-dapp-wallet-prebuilt and downloaded during the Brave build process.a Brave extension which implements the local ETH wallet UI and the toolbar shortcuts.This is all implemented in https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/pull/13177.  ', ""The wallet.ethereum.org front-end is built on Meteor, which was troublesome to use in a serverless Brave extension context. We had to patch it to work in chrome-extension:// contexts (since Brave extensions use the same protocol as Chrome extensions). We also had to insert some hacks to make it possible to launch the 'Send Funds' page from a button click with a pre-populated address, since Meteor doesn't allow navigating to an endpoint unless the main app page is already loaded. Figuring out how to bundle geth and the front-end in Brave was also challenging. We didn't want to check any binaries or obfuscated javascript bundles directly into the source tree so we had to figure out ways to download these components at build time.  We had some trouble at the end with launching geth wallet creation as a subprocess and passing in the user's wallet password securely. We also couldn't get ledger nanos to work with testnet. "", ""Above all we're proud to have a wallet that is basically functional and hassle-free to set up. We are especially proud that we were able to create a more secure wallet than existing solutions like wallet.ethereum.org and Mist by applying a content security policy, loading the code in a client-side package (that will eventually be code-signed when it's released as part of Brave browser), and rendering the web app in a sandboxed context that is up-to-date with Chromium. We are also proud that the app doesn't require users to download any command-line tools or understand the inner workings of geth. We hope this will allow users of diverse backgrounds to get started with using secure hardware Ethereum wallets.Finally, as creators and users of Brave, we are super excited that Brave will have a builtin Ethereum wallet, hopefully making secure cryptocurrency management more accessible to folks who are already using Brave. "", 'We learned a lot about packaging geth and running it as a subprocess. We also learned how to write Brave extensions and include HTML files from an NPM package. In the process of coming up with this project, we learned some new things about security weaknesses in existing Ethereum wallets. ', 'We want to improve upon the wallet.ethereum.org UI by updating our fork of it to the latest web3, doing user studies, and figuring out how to make the UI more friendly for newbies. We also would like to build in wallet support for other cryptocurrencies, starting with Zcash. We also need to build in localization for non-English speaking users.

"Voice Assistant for Microsoft Identity Manager ","Voice Assistant for Microsoft Identity Manager that empowers IT Support staff to query MIM for IT Service requests","[10415, 'The Hackathon to use Azure IoT and Serverless functionality was the catalyst for me to build this project. Last year I built a WebApp version that allowed a Service Desk or IT Admin to search for a person and get a report on that uses metadata from Microsoft Identity Manager. The natural extension is therefore to use spoken word to query and have the result spoken back. It also provided me with the impetus to learn how to use and integrate a number of new Azure Services I previously hadn’t used.  ', 'The IoT Device listens for the Wake Word (Lithnet) and takes a spoken query and converts it to text using Azure Cognitive Services, then uses Azure Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS) to identify an Entity (Person) and an Entitlement (e.g. Mailbox, Active Directory). It then queries Microsoft Identity Manager (via Azure API Management and the Lithnet Microsoft Identity Manager REST API Service) to find the queried Entity before finally providing an audio response for the queried entitlement and logging the event into Table Storage and Power BI via Azure IoT Hub. ', 'After architecting a high level conceptual solution, I started investigating the elements of the solution I didn’t have previous exposure too. I started with Cognitive Services and used PowerShell and Invoke-RestMethod to formulate my web requests to integrate with the services and perform the necessary functions. I then designed my custom LUIS Model to take phrases and identify the entity and the entitlement. When I had working solutions for Speech to Text, Text to Speech, and LUIS I translated the necessary initiation piece to Python (Speech to Text) and got it working from my IoT Device. I then configured Azure API Management to front end the Lithnet Microsoft Identity Manager REST API Service. I translated the LUIS and Microsoft Identity Manager (via API Mgmt) queries into a Webhook Azure PowerShell Function. The Azure Function utilises Managed Service Identity and Azure Key Vault for the necessary credentials. Next I converted the Text to Speech PowerShell script to Python to return an audio stream of the query response that is then spoken back to the requester.The final piece was to log each request and response to Azure Table Storage and Power BI via IoT Hub for Auditing and Reporting functions.  ', 'There were many challenges in this project. Some of the more challenging ones that took way longer than I anticipated were;Developing a LUIS Model for the types of queries and intents that I wanted to be recognisedGetting Device to Cloud IoT Messages from the IoT Hub through to Table Storage and Power BI. Lots of reading and lots of failures until a configuration on the Event Hub saw everything fire up.Working with the available memory on the Respeaker Core embedded Linux device and the version of Python offered meant that I had many failed attempts with different Python Libs to be able to send Web Requests to Azure with the differing payloads and authentication methodsAccomplishments I’m proud ofI’m very proud of the entire end-to-end solution. As an experienced Identity Architect I’ve built many Identity Management solutions for customers over the last 20 years. The concept of being able to talk to an Identity Management backend and have it talk back to me still amazes me even though I’ve been working on this for a couple of months. Approaching the crazy concept initially I thought my ability to actually build it was low. After working through a high-level solution and breaking it down into functional components and then working through them individually my confidence grew and I built a working solution.What I learnedBuilding this project exposed me to numerous Azure Services that I hadn’t previously used as well as using some services in different ways. New services I leveraged and got my first exposure to are;Azure Cognitive Services Speech to Text - Used to convert the voice query to text before being submitted to LUISAzure Cognitive Services Text to Speech - Used to take the search query result and convert it to Speech to be spoken back to the requestor Azure Cognitive Services  LUIS – (Language Understanding Intelligent Service) used to identify the entity to query and the entitlement to evaluateAzure Event Hub - Sending IoT Device to Cloud messages through he IoT Hub to Event Hub to Stream Analytics. Azure Stream Analytics - Taking the Device to Cloud Messages and outputting to Table Storage and Power BIAzure Table Storage - Storing events for auditing/reportingAzure API Management - Integration of Lithnet MIM Service REST API Python - This was my first ever use of Python. The Python script on the IoT Device listens for the Wake-Up Word and interfaces with Azure Cognitive Services for Speech to Text and Text to Speech along with the Azure FunctionWhat’s next for the projectThe project is currently essentially read-only. The information that can be retrieved and the pre-requisites to make it available mean that it doesn’t consider context or authorisation. I’d love to implement voice-based authentication into the solution so that the speaker/requestor is identified by their voice pattern (using Azure Cognitive Services Speaker Identification API) and authenticated to Azure Active Directory. Based on the authorisation level of the user higher privileged requests can be initiated. (e.g. Disable User David Bowie, or Create a new user account for Colin Furze). I’d also like to enable the solution using Azure Bot Services. The way the solution has been designed allows for this.

"LightSwipe","Swipe with a thinner wallet, and peace of mind.","[3350, ""The inspiration behind our novelty hack was to eliminate the chip for good. Our prototype device receives transmitted credit card data through flashes of light that represent binary, and stores the data string via photoresistor. From there, it interprets high and low voltages as 1's and 0's and seamlessly saves all of your credit cards in a single device. You can now ditch your wallet, and actually broadcast the encrypted data via an electromagnetic field that we generate through several motor drivers, so you can make purchases at any Point-of-Sales terminal. On top of that, we create an air-tight means of data transmission! The inspiration behind this invention was technology such as Swipe or Square. They encrypt magstripe data into an audio file, but there have been known ways to break this. We thought outside-the-box, and created a way to transmit this sensitive data via LIGHT instead, which is virtually unhackable because there are no scenarios where there can be interceptable packets.   How we built itClaire Li wrote the Android application that communicates the binary light signals, and created the hardware portion of the hack that recieves the magstripe data into the device. We send the photoresistor signals into an analog input pin in an Arduino Uno, then route it to a Raspberry Pi that interprets the information. Ben Roytenberg created the hardware portion of the hack that broadcasts the data to POS-terminals for real purchases, and interpreted the stored magstripe data. He generates the electromagnetic field with this information via stepper motor driver. Challenges we ran intoThis was a very complex hack, and we ran into obstacles across every form of technology we worked with. From the first night, we realized we had to SSH headless into a Raspberry Pi and got stalled with running even the most basic scripts or checking that the photoresistor circuit was even working (it definitely wasn't, and had to be redone three or four times with help). Claire ran into issues with multi-threading and controlling the flash on an Android device to communicate the light data, and getting the photoresistor circuit to work. She had to also find a way to package the information and pass it to Ben's portion of the hardware.

"EDI Connector","Easily integrate EDI invoices into a RPA Accounts Payable (AP) process increasing process accuracy and scalability.","[3819, 'Tangentia Automation consultants were speaking to a large customer in India who were implementing UIPath for their Accounts Payable process and they were receiving invoices from their vendors in multiple formats and their accuracy was only around 60%. Tangentia has a separate business unit called Tangentia EDI that manages EDI for 1000+ companies worldwide. At a water cooler, a Tangentia Automation consultant ran into a Tangentia EDI consultant and they spoke about how they would each approach an Accounts Payable process automation and then we had our eureka moment- why not create an EDI connector from UIPath and that is how we got started on this. The business case: Many companies and many of their vendors already have some EDI infrastructure in place to exchange structured business documents and if we bring those documents within RPA enabled process, we could definitely increase our accuracy within the process as a whole, as well as make the processes easily scalable. ', 'EDI Connector within UIPath takes credentials and dates from the user and returns List of invoices with its details. Within the EDI Connector, the following are the 2 major componentsCommunication:  The EDI connector makes a secure connection with the Tangentia Gateway Cloud EDI Portal and then calls a REST API to fetch EDI information. Currently, it calls Tangentia Gateway, but it can integrate with other EDI applications as well. Additionally, it has been tested with IBM Sterling B2B Integrator.Data Transformation: Converts Raw ANSI-X12 EDI to JSON and makes it available to the UIPath data model. ', 'Our EDI Connector is built using the following steps:First, a code was developed to make a secure connection to the EDI gateway, where the credentials such as username and passwords are authenticated. The session is created with the help of tokens to ensure valid users and correct information is fetched.Second, we wrote a REST API code that fetches invoice headers and their details. This API was called within the DLL to fetch raw JSON data.Third, the fetched JSON data is then deserialized to invoice class and finally, the invoice class is returned as the output to the Uipath activity (returned as data type List).Finally, the DLL developed above is packed in NuGet explorer and imported to Uipath Studio to be used as an Activity. ', ""Converting the EDI file to human readable format was a challenge. Since the output of any EDI gateway is a file of a type *.edi and of a format which is not readable by any user due to its complexity of structure (ANSI-X12), parsing through them is a challenge within UIPath. To overcome this challenge, we developed REST API code that retrieves the invoice data from the database and translates it into UIPath readable data format as described above.What's next for EDI ConnectorTangentia Automation and Tangentia EDI consultants are looking at beta customers for the UIPath EDI Connector and will be looking at expanding the scope of the connector from the existing Accounts Payable (AP) process to cover the entire gamut of Order to Cash and Procure to Pay processes within the enterprise.

The Smart Crops app was created to enable users to visualize crop water needs and yield data.  When a user adds input to factor in the cost of irrigation and the crops value this app can help identify an ideal crop. ', 'This app provides two tools to aid people in finding an ideal crop.   The \'Crop Selection Tool\' allows users to pick a state and compare crops.  After each crop choice the user enters the crop price.  The crops average yield multiplied by this crop price will be used when determining the ideal crop at the end.  When the crops have been selected the user then inputs their irrigation costs.  This info will also be used when determining the ideal crop at the end. The ""Crop Detail Tool\' allows user to visualize detailed crop data for a chosen state.  Yield and water use data are plotted on a bar graph by year.  The user can drill down into this data by clicking on a line in the graph to get all the details available for the crop.  This includes the number of planted acres, irrigated acres, yield per acre, irrigation source (ground or surface), and amount of irrigation used.

"Real Time Lead Detector for Water Supply","Inspired by the Flint Michigan Water Crisis, a cheap and continuous Arduino lead detector that can be accessed online","[5956, 'For two years, the people of Flint, Michigan were unwittingly drinking water contaminated by lead in poisonous concentrations. The residents had no idea that they were drinking water that could and would eventually lead to several serious medical conditions. They had no way of verifying that the dirty and off-smelling water was safe like the government told them.Most current lead testing devices are kits that are single use and need to be sent to a lab, using time and money. Our goal is not only to create an affordable and accurate lead detection system, but to keep a real time graph of lead levels that can be easily accessed from the Internet. Not only is our system for long-term use, there is no hassle of sending it to labs because the readings come at a constant interval. ', 'The carbon paste electrodes (CPE) from the study, “Determination of Pb2+ ions by a modified carbon paste electrode based on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and nanosilica,” detect Pb2+ ions in an aqueous solution. A voltage is created from this interaction. The NodeMCU circuit measures the amount of voltage from the lead (from a potentiometer in these tests) and prints out the voltage amount every 30 seconds. This data is sent to Adafruit IO but also our website, which can be accessed with Internet connection.The voltage is based on the concentration of lead, so theoretically, the amount of voltage measured can be correlated to how much lead is in the water. The NodeMCU detects the voltage and sends it to the Arduino code sensor. This is sent to a live feed at Adafruit *(link below) and can be accessed from the website (in Github).  ', 'We learned about the Arduino and NodeMCU. We connected the NodeMCU to a breadboard, and since the voltage is 3.3V and we need it to be on a scale of 0 to 1V, we added two resistors of 220 ohms and 470 ohms. We connected the 3.3V, the Grounded, and the A0 pins to the circuit. We used a potentiometer to replace the lead detecting electrode. This is to verify that the NodeMCU picks up voltage information, which it does.Then, we created a model website to display this information to the public and to the user of the device. It shows the live feed of voltage. This would be useful when implemented in a pipe, so that the government can consistently check the lead levels. People can also make sure the water supply is clean for their children and safe for consumption. ', 'Our first step was figuring out how to detect lead in water. Through research, it seemed very difficult to find a chemical that reacted with lead safely and in a clear way. Fluorine reacts with lead (but “vigorously”). Chlorine reacts but it is endothermic. We thought about Sodium rhodizonate, which police use to determine bullet residue, and it causes a color change. However, that is not easily detectable by arduinos.Also, we had to figure out how to process that information. Luckily, we took classes on Arduino and The Internet of Things, which gave us the idea to use the NodeMCU with the Arduino coding language.Lastly, we had to figure out how to display it to the users. We created a website using HTML, which I (Sunny) learned for the first time today. Making the graphics and links work took some time, but we overcame the challenge.There was difficulty publishing the code we wrote for the website, even though it works on my computer. So, we included the raw files that can be downloaded onto another computer. ', ""This is my (Sunny's) first Hackathon and Nithya's second. We are a two-girl team that is relatively inexperienced, and in less than 24 hours, we were able to:    -brainstorm ideas     -research properties of lead and methods for detection    -take classes and get ideas (Arduino and Internet of Things)    -learn HTML and website making    -learn about Arduino structure and capabilities    -use Arduino coding language    -modify code in HTML and CSS    -use Adafruit and Arduino for the first time    -make a circuit with resistors, a potentiometer, and NodeMCU, connected by USB "", 'See above :) ', 'The goal location of this product would be for widespread municipal use. Attached to pipes that supply water, the lead water detectors would give a regular update on the lead levels in the water and warn citizens and government officials when the lead amount goes above the healthy amount (15 ppb). Currently, we will start with purchasable, single home detector. We want to expand it to municipal use.Future improvements are making it cheaper and smaller (possibly a ring shape to fit around the faucet). It could also be tweaked to detect other types of contaminants in the water than just lead, and be accessed from phones and receive alerts if lead amount over healthy. We want to actually test with electrodes and lead solution.ImpactNYC school water supply has not been tested in 10 years. There are problems being reported in Newark schools with drinking water. With this new innovation in water monitoring, there is regular testing (can set it to every hour, every day, etc.). There is transparency, because the information will be on the internet and be public domain; government and public will know everything. People can check for public health and safety.The water crisis of Flint Michigan could have been prevented by consistent check of lead concentration in the water supply. Hopefully, this will revolutionize water infrastructure and ensure public health.

Its time to know. Start Using this app now...You can study information on this link below to better understand things about Blood/Glucose Levels ranges in the bodyhttp://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes_care/blood-sugar-level-ranges.htmlConsequently,  The Standard blood Glucose Level set by NICE Experts were illustrated in the table below for both Non-Diabetic, Pre-Diabetics and Diabetic Patients.Diabetes is a serious illness that requires persistence medical approach and patient self-management education to prevent and reduce the risk of long-term diabetes complications.High blood sugar can reduce blood flow and damage the nerves in your feet. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can lead to serious infections. Diabetes can lead to pain,Dental gum infections,weakening of immune systems,double risk of heart diseases, Strokes, tingling or loss of sensation in your feet.Understanding your blood glucose level ranges plays a vital roles in the effective management of diabetes. If someone with diabetes has a Glucose meter, test strips and is testing, it\'s vital to know your blood glucose level. This test may be carried out before or 2 hours after meal.The test can also be carried out before excercise, at bedtime or during fasting.In the United State, blood sugar is normally measured in milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood (mg/dl). A milligram is very little, about 0.00018 of a teaspoon. A deciliter is about 3 1/3 ounces.In  Canada and the United Kingdom, blood sugar level is reported in millimoles/liter (mmol/L). You can convert Canadian or British glucose levels to American numbers by multiplying the obtained values in (mmol/L) by factor of  18.If someone from Britain, Canada reports that their fasting blood glucose was (6mmol/L), you can multiply that by 18 and get their U.S. glucose level of 108 mg/dl.Diabetic Patients and their respective caregivers must also use pen and a log-book to record their glucose level on daily basis and then brings it in the next follow-up medical appointments in order for the Doctor/Physician to decide on what could be the next line of actionin fighting the diabetes chronic diseases.This is what the apps Does:Glucose Level Check (is a free web, mobile-web and Android apps) that help you monitor and record your Sugar/Glucose Level anytime anywhere.This app enable Diabetic Patients to easily share their data securely and privately with Diabetes Treatment teams,Doctors over SMS,Emails etc. in order to help you and your doctor see how your treatment is working and to know possibly what could be the next treatment options.

"Ovulation &amp; Menstral Cycle(A Multi-Billion Dollar App)","Monitor and Record your Ovulation and Fertility Cycle in Real-Time.","[6996, 'They have been series of family issues here and there regarding some men being aggressive with their wives, life partners saying that their partner cannot get pregnant despite being medical fit,Some argued that they need either Male or Female Child. However, most times it may be that they are having Sex when the woman is not in her Fertility Period. Millions of Women does not even know when they will be expecting theirPeriods, Ovulations or even Pregrenancy to better plan her sex time period or perhaps for family planning...Understanding your Ovulation & Menstral Cycle plays a vital roles in the effective management of your womenhood System for either becoming Pregnant or avoid it.Ovulation and Menstral Cycle are intercalated in nature. Ovulation? is the release of eggs(ovules) from the female Ovaries. This eggs are available to be fertilized by sperm cell.It a mid-point of menstral Cycle.What the App DoesThis app will enable Users(women)to  monitor and record her Ovulation Cycle/Periods, Knows her next Menstral Period, Her Fertility Period which increases herchances of getting Pregnant or avoiding it which can be tracked on the App History & Calendaring System.it tell the User the actual day She will give birth if She concieve.Consequently, If women has sex before 6 days or more before She Ovulates, the possibility that She will get pregnant is uncertain and absolutely tends to zero.The app also tell you the actual day your egg or ovule is available to be fertilized by Sperm cells. The app will tellyou the actual day that you can have sex so that you can have either a boy or a girl by usingDr. Shettles Mathematical Formula. Shettles discovery indicates, men produce two types of sperms, the X (female) and Y (male). Dr. Shettles\' studies suggests the y-sperms are smaller, weaker, but faster than their siblings x-sperms, which are bigger, stronger, but slower.Consequently, According to Dr. Shettles, there are other options in getting either a Male or a Female Child and they includes1.) PH value of Women Varginal Tract.A more acidic varginal tracts favors girls, since it will kill the weaker y-sperms first, leaving a greater quantity of x-sperms available to fertilize the egg. Consequently, a more alkaline environment favors boys.Shettles recommends a douche of water and vinegar (acid) immediately before intercourse to favor a girl; a douche of water and baking soda (alkaline) will help for a boy.Very mportant: Some women are naturally very acidic and may have serious issues producing boys because acidic medium kills  Y-Sperms easily.2.)PH of Women\'s orgasms.PH is a measure of Alkalinity or Acidity of a medium.  Orgasms mostly occurred when sex is at climax with a partner and the woman is sexually stimulated.When a woman has an orgasm, the body releases some milky fluid substance that makes the environment more alkaline, favoring boys. consequently no orgasms will favour girls!.The book titled ""The Case of the Female Orgasm: Bias in the Science of Evolution by Elisabeth Lloyd, Ph.D., a biology professor at Indiana Universitysuggest that to have Orgasm, ""Sex Partners needs to relax to build sexual tension.""The best preparation for a big orgasm is probably a long, steamy shower, full-body massages by and for your man or 10 minutes of steady oral sex, if you can get it. 3.)Sexual Positioning & PenetrationPositioning during sex and depth of penetration are also affected by PH. Towards entrance to the vagina, women tract is too acidic and thus shallow penetration will favour X-Sperm producing girls. consequently,deep penetration will favour Y-Sperm producing boys because the Sperm are closer to the egg for fertilization.All this Information can be Tracked also from the app History Menu and by Navigating The Menstral Calendering System using Calenders ""Next and Previous"" buttonThe app will periodically and automatically update the women via SMS components on her next Menstral Period, Ovulation Time, Fertility Time, Non-Pregnancy time ,Male or Female Child conceiving time and Child Birthrate if She conceives all in real-time.Platform of AvailabilityAndroid, Web & Mobile Web.Apps Screenshots Scenario and UseabilityThe Screenshot below show the Apps Landing PageThe Screenshot Below show Users making registrations from within the appThe Screenshot Below show Users  Uploading His Profile Pictures,br>The Screenshot Below show Users entering her Menstral Cycle Data for Analysis/5.png)The Screenshot Below show Users show Users Menstral historical Data Over time..The Screenshot Below show Users Menstral Calendaring SystemHow to test the Demo....I Just created one account but you can create as many as possibleUsername: testpassword: testFirst Signup within the app either from the Mobile web or from the android version.

Sure the technology exists but it stumped us as to why we hadn\'t seen anyone doing what we aim to do.  Due to time constraints with such a huge vision, we focused on three points in the Student Union for this weekend. The first feature we thought would have a big impact on the student body is automating the textbook system. The vision is, iBeacons are placed at the front of the Bookstore. UAccess is fully integrated   is the main hub for students and textbooks there When a student walks by, they are picked up by the beacon and are sent a notification that asks if they\'d like to reserve their textbooks. Their textbook lists are then accessed and pulled from the UAccess database and   The students then select the textbooks he/she wants and that is then sent downstairs via a request on internal computers to begin the process of pulling the books. The user is sent a time as to how long it will take (calculated based on how many reservations) and they can then use the indoor mapping system to locate supplies or apparel they may need which can help cut the time and keep it as consistent as possible. The second space we planned for was the good ol\' classroom. The student walks through a beacon outfitted class and is checked in for their attendance. The professor can then check the attendance to double check, just in case someone does not have a smartphone. The app, now being recognized as in a classroom, shifts to 3 options. Attendance, an app wide UAccess tab, and now a clicker integrated into it. No need to spend $100 on a dinky clicker!!!! If a student who is not registered for that class walks in, they will receive a notification they are in the wrong room and have the option of being routed in the case of them getting lost. The teacher is also notified of the student for safety purposes as well as academic integrity purposes. The third is an option for a map that will be on every ""live-page"" What I mean by this is since the beacons have amazing accuracy, when you are near Mckale Center the U of A app will have its app wide features as well as some that are only available by Mckale. This includes taking the classes option, moving it to a non central-focused space and replace it with a news and tickets interface. The map is the main hub for this school and this experience.

"""Teach me Tables"" - an Alexa Skill","""Teach me Tables"" helps kids learn and memorize math tables in a new, interactive, visually appealing and fun way.","[4190, 'As I live in New Jersey but work in New York, I get very little time to teach my kids at home.On one Saturday morning, I tried to teach math tables to my 6 year old. It was difficult. After different trials and errors, I found a way to keep her engaged and entertaining. I told her that we were going to play a game.First, I would draw the first 5 items from two table in big bold letters on a blackboard and challenged her to remember as many as she can. Once she is ready, I would wipe those out, and quiz her the first half of the 2 times table. I am surprised to see her learning quickly. Gamification of teaching tables this way made engaged and entertaining. So, from then on, every Saturday, we would play this game. She not only enjoys this mode of learning but started learning tables quickly. So, I thought of spreading this method to all other parents like me because it is very effective.  I thought the best way to do this is to automate this process so that all other kids can use it in a fun way.After exploring, I found Alexa Presentation Language (APL) with which we can create beautiful, immersive experiences by building an Alexa skill that runs on every device such as Echo, Echo Show, Fire TV, etc.My daughter loves this Alexa skill I have built, and she loves to play it over and over again on our Smart TV (using Amazon Fire stick) and she now knows tables all the way up to 8th table perfectly and she is just in the First Grade :)  ', '""Teach me Tables"" is an Alexa Skill that helps kids learn and memorize math tables in an interactive, visually appealing and fun way. It starts out by asking which table kids like to learn. It then displays and recites the first five items from that table. It will ask the user to memorize them and once they are ready, it tests their memory with a short quiz. It congratulates kids using funny voices when they get it right, and when they get it wrong, it makes funny sounds and tells them the correct answer.For every correct answer, it assigns 10 points and the score is tracked throughout the session to keep kids engaged. Once the first half of the table is completed, it then goes on to teach  the rest of the table using similar techniques. This skill is developed based on a real life, proven teaching techniques used to teach kids master their math times tables. ', 'The skill is built using Node.js, Alexa Skills Kit (ASK), Alexa Presentation Language (APL), Visual Studio Code, Lambda, Git and AWS.APL is very fun to play with.

"mARk","Leave your mark on the world. ","[6797, ""We've all gone hiking and seen geotagging. We've all seen PokemonGo come and leave, disrupting our lives in ways we didn't see coming. We believe that AR's purpose is to merge reality with the digital world, and we feel that creativity is essential to utilizing AR in the best way possible. That's why we decided to create mARk, an app where you can make AR Art Pieces (or ARt as we like to call it) and share them with the world. "", ""mark allows users to experience art pieces based on their current location. The app loads different marks based on the users location, and lets users see the unique pieces in their area. Through simple motions, the users are able to place spherical nodes anywhere in the world, and send these nodes to be shared with the world forever.How it's builtBuilt entirely with Apple's AR Kit and Google's Firebase, this project utilizes ARKit with SceneKit to render the environment. Marks are sent from our application to the database with the press of a button.We used Swift, AR Kit, and Google's FirebaseChallenges we ran intoOriginally at the start of the hackathon, our team was set on creating an AR app using the Unity platform. We attempted to use technologies on Unity such as Vuforia and Mapbox in order to create an AR camera and to keep track of location. However, after 15 hours of hard work and setting up almost every component of the project including database set up and UI, we failed to make progress towards to the core idea of our project - the ability to stick marks to a geographic location. As a result, we scrapped what we had done on Unity and decided to just use Swift to perform what we needed instead. After making the decision to switch to Swift, we encountered many other challenges as well. One main issue was figuring out how we wanted to store our data. In our application, marks were sets of 3D colored spheres which were too large to store into a database. Therefore, we had to spend a long time making design decisions, because we wanted to keep efficiency and scalability in mind to make it easy to scale the product. For example, some troubling decisions included deciding what properties to store for each mark the user creates and within each mark, how the structure of the data should look.Another big challenge was that the hackathon room itself had no GPS signal. This made testing difficult, since one of the main features we wanted to implement was how a user could only see a mark if the mark is near them. In addition to frequently going outside of the main room to perform tests, we also had to figure out a way such that marks are presented locally so that it is demoable.Unity gave us a hard time before we had to switch to SwiftAccomplishments that we're proud ofWe're proud of the fact that despite the number of difficulties that we ran into, we didn't give up. We realized that the idea was borderline impossible for us to finish in time with Unity by Saturday evening. Despite the limited time remaining, instead of calling it quits, we completely switched technologies and started on a new application. Two hours later, Ronak managed to put together a prototype despite having no previous experience with AR Kit. We all hopped onto the application and continued from there.What we learnedWe all learned new technologies. Most of us hadn't worked with augmented reality prior to this hackathon. For those that did, we still treaded with new ground as we went through and implemented augmented reality with three different technologies. Even though we failed with Unity, we all learned quite a lot in order to get a basic application running. Once we switched over to using Xcode, most of us also learned to use Swift for the first time.We also learned the importance of hacking until the very end. We ran through countless errors with Unity and design problems with Swift. It didn't change the fact that we kept pushing through the process and continued to code.What's next for markWe plan to submit to the app store, fingers crossed it'll be approved within the week.We also have a plan to monetize the app, modeled heavily after Snapchat's Model. By default, all graffiti will only be shared with your friends (which can be manually added through the app). However, companies can sponsor in app landmarks to appear in certain locations, where we can thus charge them based on time. They can import any sort of 3D STL file to give them more options.Additionally, any user using the app can share their graffiti with the whole world (for that location) for the following prices$0.99 -> Public, Accessible for a Week$1.99 -> Public, Accessible for a Month$9.99 -> Public, Accessible for a YearWe're excited by this product, and are interested to see where it goes!Built WitharkitswiftTry it outmarkshare.techgithub.com      Submitted to    HackUCI 2019Winner                Most Polished Devpost Submission                  Created by  I came up with the idea for the application and developed parts of it on Unity using technologies such as Vuforia and Mapbox.

When we moved our project from Unity to Swift, I helped Daniel with basic geolocation and color integration, as well as modifying the Firebase database to store more relevant information about the marks. Overall, I learned a lot about iOS app development and had an amazing time!Yiming ZhaoI worked on setting up the algorithm for spawning specific marks based on a location's longitude & latitude.

"Plugin generator from Atlassian Connect to JIRA Server","plugin, add-on, generator, jira server, jira cloud, atlassian connect","[4699, 'The Atlassian Connect framework greatly simplifies and unifies developing add-ons for JIRA Cloud. Unfortunately, plugins for JIRA Server still requires a considerably large amount of inconsistent boilerplate source code on both front-end and back-end sides. This is currently an obstruction in maintaining equal supports for both JIRA Cloud add-ons and JIRA Server plugins, let alone delivering the same user experience on both JIRA environments. We believe that the problem can be solved elegantly if JIRA Server plugins can be generated automatically from their JIRA Cloud counterpart. ', ""This plugin generates a JIRA Server plugin from a provided Atlassian Connect add-on's descriptor and other information including package name and artifact name. The newly generated plugin will communicate with the remote server just the same way as the Atlassian Connect add-on, and will provide the same JavaScript and REST API facilities in order to minimize the amount of adjustment on the remote server's source code.How to use itWe knew about this hackathon three weeks ago, and did not make enough time to register our plugins to Atlassian Marketplace. We provide several alternative ways for you to try out this plugin:JIRA Server plugin:https://github.com/minhhai2209/jira-plugin-generator/blob/master/jira-generator-server-plugin-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar?raw=trueOr you can just go right here and generate your plugin:http://jira-plugin-generator.tk/generateSample Atlassian Connect add-on for you to try the generator:http://jira-plugin-generator.tk:8080/hw/jsonNoticeWe include a request parameter pp (plugin path, that is <group_id>-<artifact_id>) in all callback URL. The base URL for all requests became xdm_e + cp + pp. Hence,Atlassian Connect add-on REST's base URL https://company.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/<resource> becomes https://company.com/plugins/servlet/plugin_path/rest-proxy/rest/api/2/<resource>.Atlassian Connect add-on JavaScript URL https://company.atlassian.net/atlassian-connect/all.js becomes https://company.com/plugin_path/all.js.LimitationsFor web fragments, we only support Web Item, Web Panel, Web Section, Admin Page, and General Page. Context parameters are supported for Web Item. The JWT information is send to the remote server upon installation, but we haven't used it for REST API authentication. "", ""We follow the same approach as Atlassian Connect framework, that is, showing plugin's contents inside iframes. This project consists of two components - a plugin template, and a generator.The generator simply inserts into the JIRA Server plugin's descriptor locations of web fragments declared in Atlassian Connect add-on descriptor. It also replace various placeholders with real information, like artifact ID and package name for Java source code.For plugin template, the descriptor contains the declaration of all web fragments. When a web fragment being displayed, the renderers consult information provided in the Atlassian Connect add-on's descriptor to inject the corresponding iframe. We leverage Atlassian Connect's JavaScript to provide the same API for communication between the iframe and the host UI, so that developers do not have to update their client-side logic. The plugin template also provide a servlet that forward REST API calls to /rest/api/2 endpoint. This servlet act as a proxy that authenticates the requests using JWT token, and authenticate itself with Java using a JIRA administrator account. "", 'We had to study the underlying design of Atlassian Connect framework. We also have to master the JIRA Server plugin framework to provide as much as possible the facilities that Atlassian Connect provides for developers. ', 'We are happy to see that the idea works. At our company, we had built two add-ons for JIRA Cloud, and will have to build more. This plugin generator will significantly reduce our efforts and seamlessly provide the same user experience for both JIRA environments.

"FireNode - Wardriving as a Service","A real time localization platform that provides high resolution population density maps of network infrastructures","[5902, 'The idea for our hack came to us as we decided where we were going to set up for the weekend during the hackathon. As we searched crowded rooms across north campus, we knew there had to be a way to get real time updates about how many people are on campus and where they are studying. From this, FireNode was born.  ', ""FireNode is a real time interior localization platform designed to provide high resolution population density maps of large network infrastructures. FireNode is a learning algorithm utilizing big data concepts - as more wifi hotspot data is collected, FireNode's knowledge of the network and hotspot locations expands to reflect more accurate user densities. Our service has three main components; data acquisition, analytics, and presentation. The data acquisition is carried out by a mobile app that reads GPS and wireless network information. This information is sent to a server where data analytics are performed using custom algorithms. Our algorithms determine the location of wifi hotspots through trilateration (similar to triangulation) and determine the number of people connected to a given hotspot. From there, the analytics data is sent to be presented to the user as a map overlaid with relative population density with a resolution down to individual rooms.     "", 'We built a mobile Android app to continuously monitor network and GPS information in the background of the Android operating system. The app scans all available wireless hotspots every 5 seconds to retrieve access point IP addresses, MAC addresses and RSSI/frequency. The RSSI (signal strength) and frequency allows us to calculate  distance from the phone to a wireless hotspot. In addition, we monitor GPS location changes to pair network hotspots with a Latitude/Longitude coordinate. We use Firebase as our data management service, sending the real time data outlined above to the Linode Server. This Linode server hosts our java server, which analyzes and processes over a hundred wifi/gps combinations a second to identify the exact location of scanned wifi hotspots. We accomplish this by using a process called trilateration. Each non-linear trilateration calculation use all of the previous data points for a given hotspot, and custom calculations to compensate for the spherical coordinates of the earth. Finally, we have a node server running on our Linode host to gather IP connection information from the network. This node server contains an ARP table which allows us to look at all connected devices on the University campus and aggregate IP addresses. Once we have all available IP addresses, we can figure out how many connections each wireless hotspot has and link it to the location data collected before. ', 'There were a couple difficult algorithms that we had to write, involving some difficult mathematics to figure out.  Trilateration functionality on the java server was a difficult algorithm to implement. To get an accurate location out of the trilateration algorithm, we had to figure out how to convert latitude and longitude GPS coordinates to useable distances in a pseudo-cartesian coordinate system. For the mobile app, getting the distance between the user and the wifi router proved to be a challenge. We had to manually calculate the distance using the strength and frequency of the connected wifi signal. In terms of networking, matching BSSIDs to IP addresses in order to find unique connections over the entire network was a big task, given the massive size of the network. It required a lot parsing ARP information and finding suitable _ insights _  from that data. ', 'We are proud of our ability to overcome all of the challenges that we ran into while developing FireNode, ranging from the difficult mathematics of trilateration to parsing the massive amount of data about the network. We are also proud of the low latency time between collecting our data and displaying it to the user, i.e. making our application truly real-time. ', ""Dominik learned Python.Sean learned about the Android framework.Michael learned about networking via the Android OS.Dominik taught Antonio that Python has a continue keyword...We still haven't learned what the TBD prize was...? "", 'FireNode can now be expanded in countless ways. As our database grows, we can incorporate machine learning for predictive technologies. FireNode aggregates a lot of data about population density and traffic on a room by room resolution, which could be useful to both students and the school. Students who are looking for a place to study or an uncrowded room to work in would easily be able to see in real time which rooms would be the best to work at any given time. Schools on the other hand could use the data over a period of time to gauge and better understand what areas of buildings are used the most, have the highest traffic, and what areas of the building may need more Wifi access points. What is really exciting is that FireNode can be applied anywhere with a large network infrastructure, like corporate campuses, malls, or high traffic areas.

"EmergencyChain","Decentralized first responder network and secure emergency medical data delivery system","[4525, ""It's hard to find legitimate use cases for blockchain technology "", ""This system is designed to address two problems:Often (especially in rural and developing regions) emergency medical services like 911 simply can't arrive in time. When a sudden emergency occurs, fast help is often the difference between life and death.When 911 does arrive, they don't have very much information about you. Your medications, allergies, conditions, emergency contacts – information that could help them save your life, but isn't often available.To address these issues, we propose a permissioned blockchain network designed to connect individuals with confirmed first responder training\xa0(EMTs, doctors, nurses, ...) who happen to be extremely nearby when an emergency situation occurs. Many of these responders will be willing to be notified even in the middle of the night if they could save a life in jeopardy if they're only 10 blocks away.The system will additionally support the delivery of emergency medical data, curated (and optionally stored) by potential patients themselves to both official emergency services and the nearby first responders (once they have published a transaction stating that they are nearby and en route to help). "", ""The ethereum-based, private network is secured by validator nodes run by hospitals, physicians, EMSs, fire departments, etc: organizations we know have a vested interest in preserving human life (even the pessimistic must agree they are incentivized because they rely on living humans for revenue). They validate transactions, approve new validators, and authorize first responders.We use IoT devices (phone accelerometers/gyroscopes, wearables, etc) to detect potential emergencies and send a notification asking the recipient to confirm they are OK. If they don't, we immediately contact the closest official emergency responder service (911) and additionally launch a transaction on the blockchain. This component – the accident detection service – can either be run on a private cloud server paid for by the potential patient or run by a validator node or external third party as a SaaS.Once an emergency is in process, first responders will be notified via a mobile app (either through a push notification sent by the validator who authorized the first responder to join the network, or by running a custom mobile light client) if the emergency is within their configured range. They can choose to respond, which involves publishing their location, intent, public key, and optional contact data. Once a responder is confirmed, the patient's emergency medical data will be encrypted with the responders public key by the accident detection service and delivered to the responder as they approach the patient. "", 'Scope creep was a big one. It was hard not to try to build everything and then some. This was an extremely interesting use case to develop and we hope people who see its value will reach out to us to discuss it further.Also our front-end guys took this opportunity to learn react-native for the first time (great job X!) ', 'We believe this is both a legitimate use of blockchain technology (as the centralized version of this service would be hugely invasive for both patients and responders, and would present and extremely high-value target for malicious actors) and a good example of a use case that can only succeed on a permissioned chain as the geo-coordinates of an incapacitated victim could be easily exploited by malicious individuals for their own morbid gain if they were published on a publicly-accessible network. ', ""First and foremost: The ethereum community really needs some robust light clients.Also, discussion of this use case really convinced us that easily-managed-by-grandma private cloud server applications need to exist, and need to be easy to create.

"Relations for JIRA","Introducing companies and contacts to JIRA","[9262, ' ', ' ', ""We started building this add-on because some of our colleagues had a serious need to manage their relations in JIRA. After some research, we noticed that many people were looking for some sort of CRM functionality in JIRA. We weren't sure what people were looking for exactly though... This is why we built an MVP Server version of Relations and shipped it internally and to a dozen customers for feedback. And boy, we learned a lot from that! The #1 feedback we got is that people definitely needed this add-on.Even though we were using Server ourselves, like most of our clients, we decided to focus our efforts on JIRA Cloud at first. Why? Because we realized that the challenges for the Cloud version were an order of magnitude more complex, that decisions would be harder and that the technology would likely slow us down. But going through this tougher road would ultimately help us later when going back to Server and it would allow us to reach way more users right from the start.Looking back, we're glad we went down this road. It's not that we have an exciting feature list, but we know that we have a very strong core and that what we have, we can build on.We chose technology that would allows us to build on an amazing stack, but also port as much code as possible back to the Server version. All of the front-end code is therefore written in ClojureScript. The backend is written in Clojure with a strong dependency on the Datomic transactor. For the Server version we will match that with a triple/quad store implementation of a Sesame RDF store that will use Active Objects for storage. But that's enough buzzword-bingo. "", ""The first challenge we took on was to write our own Connect framework implementation in Clojure. We kind of reverse engineered the existing Java and NodeJs frameworks into a Clojure version. We are glad we did this for the full control it gives us for that part.Another big challenge, that is completely unrelated to technology, is the place where the data lives. Suddenly the data does not live inside a customer's JIRA, but we are responsible for it. We must do the best we can to make Relations for JIRA a safe place for our customer's data. Legislation from all around the world will play a big role in this, as we are storing sensitive and personal data.Other challenges include the limitations the Connect framework imposes on our work.

Why can't we just let everyone have access to the speakers?What It DoesAux allows a host user to login into their Spotify account and create an empty playlist, identified by a pin that can be shared with other listeners. After someone has the playlist pin or 'Aux code', they can access the request system for that playlist. The request system queries Spotify's library and allows the requested songs to be voted upon. Every few minutes, the top requested song is queued into the party playlist.How We Built ItWe built Aux using Spotify's API and a Flask server.Challenges We Ran IntoThe Python API wrapper we used, Spotipy, made it difficult to get authorization for the host account in an elegant way.AccomplishmentsWe accomplished so much this weekend: running a server locally, accessing and generating a user playlist, and implementing a live voting and priority queue system.What We LearnedOur group has learned a lot about front and back-end development, specifically experimenting with JS, Angular.js (although unsuccessful), and Flask.

"Airena","A game where you write &amp; edit AI code on the fly to fight in the arena!","[5537, 'I\'ve always loved the idea of writing an AI bot to challenge or fight others. I think it\'s a super fun way to learn to program and feels empowering. I always wanted to host a ""St. Olaf vs Carleton Bot Wars"" sort of thing, but none of the available tools really make it easy. That\'s mainly because:You can\'t challenge individual people or groups. You can only upload your code to fight in the global leaderboards.You can\'t easily play the game as a human, or play against your own bot as a human player.Most games are grid-based. (Which is ideal for developing AI, but is often not what the real world looks/feels like)So I set out to make something that should be: simple, flexible and tangible. I wanted something that does not obscure the process of writing code. No one writes a perfect algorithm from scratch on their first try. Programming is an iterative process. It\'s very important for beginners to see that to understand how talented programmers do what they do and how they got to where they are. * My tool will be highlighting, rather than obscuring, the process of writing code.* ', ""Airena (pronounced Eye-reen-a) is a multiplayer game, a teaching tool and a (prototype of a) platform. It's a space shooter that you can play as a human. You can immediately click on the code button to write up your bot and watch it take over. Joining the game is as easy as opening the link. "", ""I used CreateJS for manipulating the canvas and vector graphics. I used CodeMirror for the in-browser code editor. I'm using NodeJS with Socket.io for the networking. The game runs the Javascript code you supply it in an isolated container so you can't interfere with the game itself. All you can do is return which key to press next. You have access to some data about the world, such as your position and the positions of other players.  "", 'Not having really done a proper multiplayer/networking game before definitely made it a challenge to figure out how to connect and sync multiple users across the world. It was even more challenging to figure out how to allow anyone to run their own AI bot on the fly. I also spent a lot of time thinking about a game that would be simple enough to implement but still provide enough interesting challenge/strategy to be played by humans and AI. ', ""This is definitely the easiest and fastest way to write code for an AI bot and see immediate results (all within a browser!)Variables and state information persist even though the code gets recompiled at every keystroke!The server keeps track of every player's code and state in its own isolated container, separate from the global state.The live-coding-server logic is more or less decoupled, making it easy to repurpose for any other game or simulation for teaching purposes. (Imagine it being as easy as: import the plugin, define which function you want users you to be able to live-edit, and a code button pops up that allows users to play with the code in real time!)Despite how simple this game is, this would actually be pretty close to a real setting where you might implement AI because of the game state is continuous (not grid based). If we wanted to teach people about techniques such localization, we could omit sending the current player's position and have them use the common techniques to locate themselves on the map. "", ""I learned a lot about writing networked code, and thinking about decisions such as what logic goes on the server and what can be kept on the client. I also learned about how Javascript can be executed as a separate process within Nodejs (using the VM built in library) and about all the different ways of capturing and isolating an environment. (I'm currently taking a Programming Languages class so it felt highly relevant here!) I had also never used CreateJS before. I could have used Phaser, which is a library specifically built for games, and it probably would have been a lot easier, but I decided to use CreateJS because I hadn't used it before and because it's built to be more general (to support any rich interactive content on the web, not just games) I thought it would be a good tool to know.  "", 'I want to do two main things:One is to further develop the game to make it more fun and interested to write AI for. One thing I\'d love to add is the ability to release ""minions"", so you\'re no longer able to play very effectively as a single human. Then you can feel/see the power of programming. Perhaps a way to store and share code snippets that do various kinds of behaviors.The other is to clean up and publish the live coding server as a standalone, to encourage more people to experiment with this idea, because I very much believe in learning by doing, I think by making it easy to implement this we could improve learning materials and show more people how fulfilling and exciting writing code really is!Source: https://github.com/OmarShehata/Airena ']","['node.js', 'socket.io', 'create.js']","True","27","['omarshe7ta']","https://firefly-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/usercontent/fill/242/161/cGhvdG9zL3Byb2R1Y3Rpb24vc29mdHdhcmVfdGh1bWJuYWlsX3Bob3Rvcy8wMDAvMzczLzExMC9kYXRhcy9vcmlnaW5hbC5naWY=/airena_killer.gif?signature=283462d73af5533bb7161fb4930ac33d48f19918","False","2"

"Work Safety Management (WSM)","...safety monitoring just got efficient","[5816, 'During our internship at a utility industry, we build software that supports many fields workers. These are folks whose work may include performing inspections and repairs in potentially hazardous environments. Most of the software we’ve been developing aids these folks from a productivity standpoint by improving how they perform their work.However, we’ve noticed that nothing really supports them from a safety perspective. They are required to take safety-training courses and acquire certifications, which are useful, but as a team, we started thinking about how could software be used to improve worker safety.  We noticed that sometimes field workers working in hazardous conditions are not able to focus on safety while they are working on their assigned work. For example, a construction worker working near a Gas Pipeline may not able to sense minor gas leaks as he/she is focused on their assigned task. This can cause loss of life and property.Work Safety Management System is our attempt at addressing this problem. ', ""This IoT System contains an Arduino based IoT device which can be connected to worker's helmet, this device senses the Temperature, Pressure, Humidity, Heart Rate, Gas Concentration around the worker and sends it to Azure IoT hub.An Azure Function App gets a trigger via Event Hub whenever there is a new reading available at the IoT Hub. That function stores the reading in the Azure SQL Database and if the readings are above the Threshold levels ( threshold levels are stored in the database and can be configured by Administrators) then the Function App sends a Cloud-to-Device alert message to the device to inform the workers to move to a safe area.A WebApp (hosted on Azure App Service) allows the managers/supervisors to log-in and see their team's status on a Dashboard in a Web Browser. If the managers/supervisors want to send an alert message manually then they can do so by just a click of a button.In this device prototype, we are getting real values for Temperature, Humidity & Pressure from the on board sensors and we are simulating the Hear Rate, GeoLocation and Gas Concentration readings in code. "", ""IoT Device:We are using MXChip IoT DevKit (AZ3166) as the device. The source code for this Arduino based development board is written in C/C++. It has many sensors embedded on the board, so we didn't have to solder the sensors manually and we were able to focus more on the functionality.Web App, API, Database & Function App:*The Web App & API are built using (C#) ASP.NET Core to handle the business logic on the server side. *We used C# for developing Functions on Azure Function App. *We are using JavaScript to get data from the API to the Dashboard and also to handle several client-side components, including the Maps (using Azure Maps), Alert, etc.*We also used Power BI for showing the historical status graph on the dashboard. Power BI really helped us to speed up the dashboard development process, as it allows us to design professional looking graphs very quickly.We are using Azure SQL Database for storing all the application data. "", 'There were several challenges involved in getting the front end components working properly with the back end API, particularly using the Azure Maps, as custom javascript and CSS had to be written to get the functionality we wanted.Initially, we were facing issues making the IoT DevKit send telemetry data to IoT Hub. Later we found out that the issue was because of a bug in the older version of IoT Workbench Extention for Visual Studio Code. Updating that extension to the latest version Fixed that issue.We also faced some challenges while making the Function App trigger automatically when the device sends the readings to IoT Hub. ', 'We are most proud of how far the project has come in such a short development time span. As we came to know about this Hackathon just 4 weeks before the deadline. Over the course of development, we thought of many great ideas that we would like to add to the application but were unable to implement due to time constraints. However, despite this, we have built out all of the core functionality and UI to serve a strong foundation going forward. ', 'Since this project uses many third party tools we learned a lot by working on this project, including how to use Azure Function App with automatic triggering with IoT Hub, Azure Maps, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, and using VS Code for Arduino development. ', 'We will continue to work on the project to expand and improve upon it. The current project will serve as a strong foundation. Going forward, we would like to support different type of devices, as well as to provide access control on the dashboard to support employees of different levels.

"Smart Fridge","A Smart Fridge that uses Computer Vision to log in food, keeps user updated by SMS, and provide recommendations. ","[5242, ""We saw the brand new Samsung Family Hub smart fridge at the CES 2017, which require manual data log-in for the goods stored inside. We got inspired to create a smart fridge that can automatically log in what's inside the fridge, enable users to access the data remotely and have information recommended for the users based on what they have in the fridge. "", ""This is an IoT-based smart fridge that uses Computer Vision to automatically log in food, informs the users through text messages of what's stored inside and expiration data, and recommend healthier and better use of user's’ current storage through features like checking nutrition and search for recipes related to some items.  "", 'We used a button on an Arduino board to emulate the action of “closing the fridge door”. The signal created by the button is sent to a PC through a serial COM port. When PC receives that signal, the kinect camera is triggered to capture a photo of the current status in the fridge. The photo is then compressed and sent to our web server. Our web server is coded on Python+Flask and deployed on Google App Engine Flexible Environment. This web server also contains some logics for responding to Twilio messages, which will be mentioned later. When the web server receives that photo, it puts the photo in Google Cloud Storage. It also keeps some basic image metadata in Google Cloud Datastore database. Then the Google Cloud Vision API is called to analyze the photo and label it by what the item is and which category it belongs to. The labels (coming out of cloud vision api) are then passed to Google KnowledgeGraph API to be further narrowed down to things people would normally put in a fridge. The results coming out of Google KnowledgeGraph are then stored in Google Cloud Datastore database. Now the fridge basically identifies the items that were put in it by automatically capturing and analyzing photos. Every time new items are added to the fridge, Twilio would send a notification through SMS to inform userUsers are also able to text Twilio some basic commands to:Check what is currently in the fridgeCheck which item is about to pass its expiration dateCheck the nutrition of the food storedSearch for recipes related to some items ', '1) Capture the kinect photo with the least noise and incorporated Arduino-based trigger for the photo 2) Integrate the local image capture, python web server, google cloud platform, and twilio together and make them work flawlessly. Specifically, the challenges include the following:Image format conversionImage compression and processingHandling HTTP POST/GET requests between Local and web servers for images as well as web servers and twilio for sending and receiving textsCreate appropriate database structure to store images and item labels3) At first, it was really hard to pick the right label from about 10 labels returned by cloud vision api. We used KnowledgeGraph first to narraw the list down to 3-5 labels, and then manually process them according to how “general” or “specific” they are.4) There were some misleading parts in the documentation of cloud vision api in Python. The URI stated in the doc is not the correct format required by the actual function. We finally figured it out by looking into the C# version of that documentation.

"Tobii Ghost - Eye Tracking Twitch Extension","An extension that allow viewers to see where the streamer is looking at the screen. ","[6731, 'Tobii is the world leader in eye tracking technology. Founded in 2001, the company has built its reputation on providing millions of families with the tools it needs in order to better communicate. Eye tracking was born as a research tool, but soon exploded in the specialty market where users were able to communicate using our products (Watch Sebastian Story). Since then we have uncovered countless uses for this technology.The inspiration for Tobii Ghost came about whilst watching speech tablet users, We soon realized that we were trying to guess what they were trying to say just before they actually said it, giving us a visual representation of user intention.With this thought formed and being avid gamers ourselves, we began toying with the idea with the belief that this had great potential ONLY IF we were able to have a good visualization tool to display exactly where and what a person is looking at.Challenges we ran intoBack then we didn’t have a good visualization tool for eye movements on screen. However, there did exist a lot of experiments such as Dwell-Free that allowed us to trace a succession of actions based on heat maps. Whilst innovative, it wasn’t really suited to gaming. We needed something less intrusive and based on what we experienced, heatmaps were a step in the right direction in terms of achieving fluency.So, we accelerated the decay of the heatmap and that created a kind of a waterdrop effect in the screen (The first bubble!). We then created a different variation of that technique that ended up being the customization feature in our extension. After that things gathered steam. We showcased the functionality to Eleague and we were promoted in a  ""Getting Technical"" segment that became quite popular in the show. After that (by content creators/streamers request), we made this a streaming tool. Accomplishments that we are proud ofThe 2nd challenge came when we had the option to transform this streaming tool as an extension, by that time twitch was working in a new version of their extension store showcasing a new way of visualizing extensions in categories,  that will boost discovery for newcomers. Of course, we did not want to lose this opportunity, but we had 3 weeks to research how to build this and actually do it!Also, we have no branding at all, we call it internally the ""Gaze overlay"", so we had to have that in mind too and what was more difficult by then: ""How we can help our users to explain to their viewers that the bubble means eye tracking?"". It was a huge challenge, a very exciting one with a lot of office hour but also with a ton of fun since we were doing something that no one has seen before in gaming and/or eye tracking :) We have seen an amazing reception that been translated into a great exponential organic growth. This has not only allowed us to expand in streamers numbers but also has open doors in esports events as a broadcasting tool: Rainbow Six US Invitationals   ', 'Empowers the viewer with the ability to see where the streamer is looking in the screen. Watch Demo ', ""There are various components involved in transferring streamers gaze on their screen to a stream on Twitch. The easiest way is, of course, to burn the gaze bubble into the stream. However, this won't offer the best user experience for the stream viewers as they don't have any say in the whole setup.We started to develop the Twitch extension based on the Tobii streaming gaze application which we already had. It now needed to push the streamer's gaze data to the viewers, luckily Twitch's PubSub API fitted that purpose. From the viewers perspective, they would get streamers gaze data and could customize it according to their preferences or turn it off altogether.Tobii Ghost windows application passes the gaze point data to Twitch using products offered by Amazon Web Services, then Tobii Ghost extension on Twitch will receive the gaze point data and will try to visualize it with the help of WebGL.What we learnedThat eye tracking is a great addition to streaming for 3 main reasons:a) To allow viewers to understand the streamer decision-making process while they play. b) To allow viewers to see streamers reaction time, been able to measure Streamer eye-hand coordination with their own. c) An extra tool for educational streamers to showcase their game awareness and what they focus is in the different stages of the game. in addition, being able to have access to all the data that streamer generates with AWS has made us learn a lot about our users. What we initially thought was a great product for the battle royale and overall shooter genre, has given us an amazing response in some other communities. That has been the case with  OZU!, Tetris 99, Guitar Hero, Chess and Poker and IRL. We have also learned how to create a community out of this specific extension. What started as a support channel for new users, today is a place where streamers are constantly discovering new ways to use their eye tracker to connect deeply with their viewers. We are very aware that we have only just started and there is a long path to follow in terms of development, but for now, we have achieved great things and one of them is celebrating user content. We have done that not only by placing them into the spotlight.What's next for Tobii Ghost - Eye Tracking Twitch ExtensionThere is a lot cooking, so going forward we intend to make sure we continue the development of this tool by listening to our community feedback since we believe that user-centered design is the best way to explore the future of eye tracking in streaming.Based on that we are looking forward to working together with Twitch in order to fix time sync. Right now that is a process that needs to be done manually for every streamer. We believe that the outcome of this will be a big revolution since we will be able to provide the social aspect of eye tracking allowing viewers to make clips including Tobii Ghost.We are also looking forward to extending our experience to more devices, with mobile as a big target.Lastly to be able to give streamers way more control and data over how their viewers interact with the extension, so they can see what decisions boost engagement.Try it outgaming.tobii.com      Submitted to    Twitch AWS Extensions Challenge    Created by  Back-end DeveloperMohammad MousaviContent strategy, promo.

We showcased the functionality to Eleague and we were promoted in a  ""Getting Technical"" segment that became quite popular in the show. After that (by content creators/streamers request), we made this a streaming tool. Accomplishments that we are proud ofThe 2nd challenge came when we had the option to transform this streaming tool as an extension, by that time twitch was working in a new version of their extension store showcasing a new way of visualizing extensions in categories,  that will boost discovery for newcomers. Of course, we did not want to lose this opportunity, but we had 3 weeks to research how to build this and actually do it!Also, we have no branding at all, we call it internally the ""Gaze overlay"", so we had to have that in mind too and what was more difficult by then: ""How we can help our users to explain to their viewers that the bubble means eye tracking?"". It was a huge challenge, a very exciting one with a lot of office hour but also with a ton of fun since we were doing something that no one has seen before in gaming and/or eye tracking :) We have seen an amazing reception that been translated into a great exponential organic growth. This has not only allowed us to expand in streamers numbers but also has open doors in esports events as a broadcasting tool: Rainbow Six US Invitationals  What it doesEmpowers the viewer with the ability to see where the streamer is looking in the screen. Watch DemoHow we built itThere are various components involved in transferring streamers gaze on their screen to a stream on Twitch. The easiest way is, of course, to burn the gaze bubble into the stream. However, this won\'t offer the best user experience for the stream viewers as they don\'t have any say in the whole setup.We started to develop the Twitch extension based on the Tobii streaming gaze application which we already had. It now needed to push the streamer\'s gaze data to the viewers, luckily Twitch\'s PubSub API fitted that purpose. From the viewers perspective, they would get streamers gaze data and could customize it according to their preferences or turn it off altogether.Tobii Ghost windows application passes the gaze point data to Twitch using products offered by Amazon Web Services, then Tobii Ghost extension on Twitch will receive the gaze point data and will try to visualize it with the help of WebGL.What we learnedThat eye tracking is a great addition to streaming for 3 main reasons:a) To allow viewers to understand the streamer decision-making process while they play. b) To allow viewers to see streamers reaction time, been able to measure Streamer eye-hand coordination with their own. c) An extra tool for educational streamers to showcase their game awareness and what they focus is in the different stages of the game. in addition, being able to have access to all the data that streamer generates with AWS has made us learn a lot about our users. What we initially thought was a great product for the battle royale and overall shooter genre, has given us an amazing response in some other communities. That has been the case with  OZU!, Tetris 99, Guitar Hero, Chess and Poker and IRL. We have also learned how to create a community out of this specific extension. What started as a support channel for new users, today is a place where streamers are constantly discovering new ways to use their eye tracker to connect deeply with their viewers. We are very aware that we have only just started and there is a long path to follow in terms of development, but for now, we have achieved great things and one of them is celebrating user content. We have done that not only by placing them into the spotlight.What\'s next for Tobii Ghost - Eye Tracking Twitch ExtensionThere is a lot cooking, so going forward we intend to make sure we continue the development of this tool by listening to our community feedback since we believe that user-centered design is the best way to explore the future of eye tracking in streaming.Based on that we are looking forward to working together with Twitch in order to fix time sync. Right now that is a process that needs to be done manually for every streamer.

"Stream Closed Captioner","Easily increase the accessibility of your stream by adding Closed Captioning for your viewers","[4703, 'I was first inspired to create a Twitch Extension like this when attending a panel by Suz Hinton (@noopkat) at Twitch Con 2017. She mentioned she was an advocate for accessibility on the web and wanted to try doing Closed Captioning on Twitch. This seeded the idea in my mind and I had it in the back of my head for a long time. Before the hackathon I started to notice broadcasters using a Closed Captioning browser source in their OBS setups, a simple section on their stream overlays dedicated to displaying speech to text closed captioning for their viewer. Seeing this rekindled the idea in the back of my mind and when the call went out for this hackathon I thought that the time was right to tackle trying to do the same but doing it as a Twitch extension video overlay that will be configurable and increase user engagement. ', 'Twitch extension video overlay that will display Closed Captioning to the viewer with the only requirement that the broadcaster uses a companion site to do the speech to text translation. All the broadcaster has to do is install the extension, enable it, login to stream-cc.gooseman.codes and click ""On"" when they go live. Once it\'s on viewers will see Closed Captioning being display on stream that they can hide or move around, with future features coming soon.  ', 'The extension front end was built using standard web UI technologies with ReactJS. The Companion site is a standard Ruby On Rails application hosted on Elastic Beanstalk. When a broadcaster signs in using a Chrome browser (Firefox support for Speech To Text is on the Mozilla roadmap) and they click ""On"". The browser will start listening to broadcasters mic and convert speech to text at near real time speeds. From there I send that information to the Server over a websocket when it passes though a simple profanity filter and then relays the payload to the broadcaster channel using the Twitch PubSub API endpoint. Now all viewers of the channel will receive the the Closed Captioning text to display. Since all viewers have a different latency to the broadcaster before displaying the text, I check the users HLS video latency and delay the display of the text for the amount of time. This helps to keep the text as in sync as possible with the broadcasters voice. ', 'One of the biggest challenges I encountered with solving the issue of the Closed Captioning being positioned in a location that was blocking a viewers experience. I grappled with a couple of ideas of having preset locations a broadcaster can set to position the CC where they would like it. But not all streams are created equal and having presets will not solve all peoples issues. I then realized, why not put it the power of the user to move the position of the CC text? So I added the ability to drag around the text on the viewer side so they can tailor the experience for themselves. This simple solution made me happy since now its in the power of the viewer on how they want to see the CC text. ', 'I am just proud I was able to build this extension using the APIs Twitch has offered. It works and it was fun building it. ', 'I learned a lot about AWS and deploying a Ruby on Rails application, I never actually built and deployed anything on my own. I also learned a lot more more about the Twitch Extension API and the data available through it. ', 'There are a lot of features I want to prototype and build for the extension.A couple ideas I like to prototype for broadcaster:Downloadable transcripts of their CC sessionEnable text translation for another language, ie. Korean language streamer enables translating text from Korean to English. A viewer will then be able to toggle betweenBroadcaster can customize the font used for the closed captioning textWhen a broadcaster says the name of an emote its could display the emote on screen or replace the text with the emoteVoice activated overlay eventsIdeas for the viewer experience side of the extension:Bit enabled actions/events with the textPay bits to cause the spoken text to rain down from the top of the screen and pile up for a period of timeStill thinking about other ideas that users can trigger with bits but not at the cost of ruining the closed captioning experience for others.

"Real Estate","A conversational search for real estate listings in your area","[3837, ""When I first learned Alexa was open-sourced, I wanted to get one.

The final product was pretty cool, and we both saw its potential. "", 'Our Alexa skill asks you a series of questions to navigate your search to find houses and properties you might be interested in. Alexa then can send you an email with a link to your graphical results.  ', 'I wrote the voice app in Java and host it as a lambda function. It uses DynamoDB to store session data and information about the app. Each time a user loads the app, it looks to see if the user has a prior session saved. Returning users have different options than new users. Once connected with our skill, a returning user experiences a personalized greeting and the ability to redo searches or continue those that may have crashed. Then, I built a server to store user info and return graphical responses in ruby on rails. The server is used for account linking and finding all of the housing data. ', 'Once the code became more complex, I realized it was no longer maintainable in its current form. It needed to be re-written and reorganized in order to be more sustainable. In my experience, voice apps commonly face this challenge because of the endless possible user states and the constant need to anticipate and evolve with them. As you add more questions, the app gets exponentially more complex. The next challenge we faced involved obtaining the data for our skill. Housing data is incredibly fragmented and locked down within the real estate market. It took a lot of time and negotiation to get access to the markets we have now.

Obtaining the housing data has also been a major point of pride within our small startup.

At every turn, there was a simple solution and a complex one, but the simple solution was often not an option. We originally wanted to build the voice interface and partner with a pre-existing real estate search company, but that wasn't as easy of a sell as we anticipated. The complex solution was to build our own website and search engine. Just as rewriting the code benefitted the future of our app, so did creating these services ourselves.

Alexa Skill that uses dynamic 3D.","[4376, 'A friend of mine told me about the Amazon Multimodal Contest, #AmazonAlexaMultimodalChallenge, and I thought I\'d take a stab at making my first Alexa Skill.  While researching the Amazon Presentation Language I looked for inspiration in my daily life to guide my direction.  One evening, my family and I were trying to decide on what movie we would watch.  This sparked the idea of a fun and interactive decision maker.  Thus was born, ""Fork On The Road"".  ', 'The skill is invoked with ""Alexa, ask Fork On The Road"".  Users are asked to add up to four things for the fork to choose from.  Users can also remove items they\'ve added.  While users are adding things, an animation of the fork bounces in the intersection of two roads.  A full 3D scene is used to present items in a fun and unique way, with items placed as dynamic 3D extruded text.  When there as at least 2 items the user can ""Spin the Fork"".  When the fork is choosing, it bounces up and spins around, slowly stopping on the path it would like you to take.  A final screen presents the forks decision using another dynamic 3D scene.  This skill works responsively across all Alexa products ranging from speech-only to TV.  ""Your destiny awaits.  Enjoy!"" ', 'This project was created using several different technologies.  It primarily uses open-source and Amazon platforms.  The key technology is Amazon\'s APL.  The APL is designed using several layers of APL Components, including APL Video, that are sequenced with SendEvent Commands and Document Directives.  Document transforms, game logic and speech response is managed using the ASK SDK for Node.js running on Lamba.  Skill configuration for invocations, utterances, intents, lambda, etc, are maintained and deployed through a Skill Manifest and the ASK CLI.  Resources and Assets come from two different sources.  Static files are hosted on S3 with a Cloudfront instance on top.  Dynamic assets, like the dynamically generated 3D scene, are requested from a Lambda service with API Gateway routing requests.  This dynamic asset service uses a Headless Chrome Node API called Puppeteer to load a website, take a screen capture, and send it back to the Alexa device with a ""image/png"" header.  The captured website uses Three.js to dynamically construct a scene based on the variables in the request and composes elements such as extruded text.  Animations were also scripted in Three.js and then captured, cropped and embedded in the APL. The 3D scene was first composed in Unity to get the look and feel correct and then exported.  Finally, the fork\'s sound effect was composed in Sony Acid Pro using a couple of layered sounds and exported to the appropriate MP3 specs using Audacity.Enlarge ImageEnlarge Image ', 'The Amazon APL is off to a great start but the games visual sequences will most likely be easier to accomplish once there are more APL Commands and Component options.

"Suju - suju.online","On demand self-driving buses using multi-parameter route optimizing aimed to help event and public transportation.","[5906, ""Our team members are hyped about Machine Learning and UX. We were intrigued by the Sohjoa virtual bus stops challenge. It allowed us to design a bus service we would love to use ourselves: a cheap but efficient alternative for the taxi/uber. We wanted to hack a bunch of state of the art tech together to show how a dynamic bus service could work.The problemEvent organizers have trouble getting their attendees to the event venue. Public transportation may not be enough and organizing custom transportation is expensive and time-consuming. The best practice for custom transportation so far is to organize a route from a pre-defined point X to the venue using a pre-defined schedule. The customers will still have to travel to point X before they can use the arranged transportation. They will have to schedule their day based on the transportation's schedule. If they don't want to deal with these problems they can choose to use their own car or get a taxi/UBER, which gets expensive really fast.  Technically, this kind of problem is often referred to as the last mile problem. We wanted to tackle a variation of this: the first mile problem. Even with just some tens of passengers there are millions of possible routes between them, let alone when a third variable, time, is taken into account.The solutionOur project for Junction 2016 aims to solve the transportation problem by using Sohjoa to organize dynamic and cost controlled custom transportation. Our concept is a tool for event organizers and public transportation decision makers that allows them to design dynamic routing for the self-driving bus. If the surroundings of a location are pre-scanned the bus can plan and drive routes that are planned on-the-go.  Our tool makes the required optimizations to the route, chooses a smart way to transport people from their desired pick-up location and tells Sohjoa which route and schedule to follow during the transportation. The use cases1) Event transportationEvents organize group transportation to boost visitor counts. Doing this in a cost efficient way is what really matters. Unlike public transportation there is a more clear business model: people bring in money, so it is worth investing money to bring them to the event. Our routing algorithm allows prioritization by cost, which means that people can be transported on a price per visitor basis.2) The commuter's first mileCurrently public transportation is organized around node points such as railway or metro stations. However, the last mile or so is often the most unconvinient for a commuter. Busses to less populated areas leave seldomly and can't stop at everyones home. Our service can create efficient routes that transport everyone from and to the general area of their home - adjusting dynamically to demand thus being able to take the shortest route to the destination.  The techThe service is running on a node.js server, with React and Redux used for the web UI. Our algorithms are written in Python so we can leverage state of the art Machine Learning libraries.1) Clustering user data  - Recursive DBSCAN machine learning algorithm to reduce the complexity of the spacetime data.2) Sjukstra routing  - Customized Djikstra that takes into account cost-factors that are specific to electric buses3) Routing with EMBERS  - Leveraging Embers route planning to get fast routes between virtual bus stops4) Data visualisation with leaflet  - Intuitive and easy to use planning and visualisation tool for virtual bus stops5) Telegram (SujuBot) end user demo  - Example of an end user UI. Helps envision how the service would look for an end user.  AccomplishmentsThe project required long hours and took our very best effort. In the end, even though at times we had problems and didn't always feel like we were progressing, we were able to create a prototype of a service that helps better imagine what is possible and how shared transportation could work. We have coded through the entire night and currently have our fingers crossed that our pitcher will stay awake through Sunday.Our main challenges were parametrizing and developing algorithms to solve the initial routing problem, we had to develop them almost from scratch. Integrating our different parts to a seamless and consistent service took lots of time and effort. Lastly, it was difficult to prioritize and scope a presentable MVP, the problem was complex and had numerous points of possible failure.What's nextOur project is left open ended. It could be taken towards multiple of development directions, but only time will tell. We hope that during the judging phase we will get inspiring suggestions or feedback on our project.Built Withazuredbscanemberses6leaflet.jsnode.jsnumpypostgresqlpythonradixreactreduxsassscikit-learntelegramTry it outsuju.onlinegithub.com      Submitted to    Junction 2016Winner                Main Prize              Winner                Embers Challenge              Winner                Sohjoa Robotbus Challenge              Winner                Track Finalists                  Created by  Deployed code to server, consulted algorithms and added very small touches on the frontend.Aleksi JokelaI developed some front endJere VaaraThe mom of the team.

Meanwhile, doing Face recognition on the device is difficult due to all the SDKs out there (some of which are limited to the processor chips, e.g., Snapdragon SDK).Using Ionic and Cordova for making an app was a really good choice due to rapid view design process, but the framework sometimes behaves unexpectedly on the actual device.

"Gradebook","Gradebook is a scalable, cross-platform information learning system analytics platform for high school students.","[6004, ""A business that makes nothing but money is a poor business.Henry FordWe weren't inspired by some life-changing experience, or by a vision to be the greatest in all of history.As students, we wanted more from our grade data. So we created the first solution.How it worksThe best way to experiment is through daily utility -- so that'sexactly how we've setup our first version.The first version of The Gradebook is built as an extension of the learning information platform Infinite Campus. In setting our application up this way, we can access existing student data, building up our platform on a system that our own school uses to store grade data.When a student signs into their school portal, we use the existing API to download all of their grade data, then we reorganize it in a way that makes it more visually pleasing, easier to understand, and more navigable.FunctionalityTheoretical Grading: Your grading platform should extend beyond the present -- we make that happen. With theoretical grading, you can add in future grades to see how it would affect your existing grade. Don't get blindsided by critical grade dumps that change your grade.Built-In Notifications: When you open the application, you're presented with any new updates to your grades. Click on any notification to immediately scroll to that class.Beautiful User Interface: Our user interface minimizes convolution while focusing on what matters most. The app is just a frame, your grades are the real content.Faster Refresh Rates: Because we solely focus on grades, we can grab your data faster. As soon as we have all of your raw grade data, we cut off the stream, minimizing data usage and maximizing download times. No extra student information is downloaded, giving us an edge over traditional platforms.Extreme Ubiquity: Our app is available on iOS and Android, with user interfaces specific to each platform. Download it at grdbk.comChallengesSince there aren't any other products in our market, we had to paveour own path.Information Learning SystemThe world of student gradebook data is a battle of the big companies: Powerschool, Infinite Campus, and many other solutions are going to head-to-head with claims over parts of the American education system. That level of fragmentation made it hard to determine where to start. Since our school,  Adlai E. Stevenson High School, uses Infinite Campus, we started with that.Initial RoleOur end goal is to provide broad-variety analytics to both students and teachers regarding overall trends in classes based on the teacher, the school, and pretty much any other possible filter. But that's a bit macroscopic -- so we started small.We decided to start off by just helping students make sense of where their grades are, and where they could be heading. Therefore we built a system that can grab student data and then provide theoretical grading.Student PrivacyStudent data has to be handled extremely responsibly, so we've done our best not to overstep. All data is solely stored locally and all calculations are done on the device in real-time. We want to shift over to a server (in beta), but we want more help and to invest more time into developing a secure server-client infrastructure first.Bug FixesWe have a small team of 3 active students, balancing our coding lives with all of our extracurriculars and academics. We often find ourselves staying up late trying to solve bugs only to find out there are more that have been discovered. Everyone is in extremely unique grading situations, and we often find ourselves tweaking our code to deal with unanticipated situations.DemographicsThough our market is the entire student population in America, we can't reach them all at once. For now, we've limited our marketing and setup to our school community: Adlai E. Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire, Illinois. We want to continue to expand outside of our community, and to move onto different information learning systems so we can access people who don't use Infinite Campus as well.AccomplishmentsCreated the first real student analytic platformCompleted our application & pushed it to the market in under 6 monthsFollowed up the iOS version with an Android version in under 3 monthsUsed by 50% of potential demographic (local school population of 4000+)News coverage in local school paper with interviewLessons LearnedBefore pushing to market, the beta process is extremely importantDesign the UI carefully, changing it radically post-release disturbs user comfortWhen someone asks for a feature, adding it makes them a loyal userConsistent updates keep users happyLoyal/happy users recommend your software to friendsUnorganized code inhibits code scalabilityUp NextThe Gradebook is still in its infancy.

As this is the Tornado season at Manhattan we decided to go ahead with the idea to create a weather Alert system using existing hardware and APIs.

Finally we decided to work on weather Alert system. After finalizing the design we decided to make a mobile application. It was getting difficult to decide platforms to work and therefore we came up with an idea of a web-based application.  We wrote the code on HTML and PHP and used LIFX and OpenWeatherMap APIs . We have implemented following functionalities.Switching Lights On/OffSetting lights to desired colors.Control brightness of the light.Implemented Special Effects - Pulse effectsWeather Alert - This is the most vital functionality. Using current user location (Longitude and Latitude ) we fetch data from OpenWeatherMap. This returns JSON data with different details about weather. There are three major categories of weather status returned - Clouds , Rain and Clear. When status is ""Rain"" we invoke a pulse notification with Blue color that notifies user of Rain. If the weather status is Clouds we give a mild purple color pulse. This indications help user to stay updated without looking at their digital devices. As this is a visual stimulus it quickly grabs user attention and saves them from missing any update (SMS or alarms can be overlooked if they are silent or in other rooms).

Learning anatomy is difficult as it usually costs significant time and effort to memorize and comprehend. Our MedReality website provides an impactful solution to increase lively study environment and promote students imagination in learning anatomy. MedReality is a virtual reality website providing students exclusive experiences including several vibrant and descriptive anatomical lessons in both human and animals. Our inspiration is to allow students to both train by themselves and in groups, as multiple users can join a virtual space and experience a human and animal anatomy demonstration.Additionally, this framework is deployed with an AI system which was trained on a cloud using human expert ground truth. The system's purpose is able to assist disease diagnosis,  medical imaging segmentation or even quantification. "", 'With the VR experience in MedReality, users may explore organs and systems in a fully immersive environment in virtual reality, display diseases in varying states of severity, and add treatments to visualize and understand medical options.Users can exploit brains, vessels, organs, bones, and muscles in order to explore anatomical structures in orthogonal views: coronal, sagital and axial. Moreover, with a richable amount of ex-vivo and clinical scan sources, MedReality promisingly encourages users to widely elaborate their learning knowledge and skills in respect to perceive a profound understanding of structures in respect to terminology and definitions. Our MedReality WebVR is an advanced learning tool that could help not only medical students but also individuals without a medical background to visualize and explore anatomy. In addition, MedReality also include an Artificial Intelligent which is trained using 3D deep neural network (3DUnet) to detect white matter, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid. This AI can be further extended to detect structures in other organs like heart, kidney, liver, etc. Furthermore, it will help to correct/guide students in learning these anatomical structures. On the other hand, this AI highly aims to 1) support students and researchers working in radiology and medical imaging to segment and quantify structure volume and 2) assist medical doctors to diagnose abnormal structures in human body such as tumors.

How?Office Floor Plan Navigator is built using an open source web based Geographic Information System (GIS) JavaScript framework. To retrieve data from Office 365, we use the Microsoft Graph API to pull user profile data including the thumbnail image. The Microsoft Graph API is called via PHP.  Assign a unique ID (add to any Azure AD field) to a desk, printer or meeting room, then, use Office Floor Plan Navigator to attach an XY coordinate to the ID.  Then, query the Azure AD for a person etc and Office Floor Plan Navigator will zoom to the corresponding XY location on the office floor plan and bring up their profile details.The custom SharePoint Employee Directory is built via ASP.net.  The embedded Office Floor Plan Navigator employs the use of a SharePoint web part and an iframe.Challenges?A couple of technical glitches were encountered when registering the application.  Permission to read user profiles did not appear to  be granted.  After much random clicking this was resolved.Also, one annoyance discovered was the lack of profile information integration between Azure AD,  Office 365 user manager, and SharePoint Online.

"Unofficial Devpost API","The unofficial part means I probably won't fix it when it breaks.","[3735, 'I was inspired by the innovative tools that I was learning about at the most recent AWS Summit here in New York (Checkout the presentations on SlideShare and Youtube if you haven\'t already.)I knew that I wanted to use AWS Lambda to run ""Event-Driven Code in the Cloud"" as they put it, and when they showed us how simple it was to create an HTTP endpoint for your Lambda functions the first thing that sprung to mind was a scraper that would take Devpost pages and return JSON.How it worksIt\'s a little quirky to work with since you\'ll need to make POST requests in order to retrieve your data as JSON, since the new API Gateway/Lambda combination doesn\'t seem to have anyway to support URL parameters yet. Here is the example CURL command I would execute to scrape my portfolio:$ curl -X POST -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d \'{""screen_name"":""MGerrior""}\' https://iii3mdppm7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/UserPortfolioEndpointObviously you will want to replace my screen name with your screen name to obtain data related to you. It\'s not built as a crawler yet, so it will only return information that is visible when you first view your portfolio on Devpost.The API uses Amazon\'s new API Gateway that provides built in caching and throttling out of the box. The API endpoint is the hooked up to a Lambda function that is executed when the request is received. The Lambda function then scrapes the page, formats it as a JSON response, and returns it to the API Gateway which subsequently returns it to you.Challenges I ran intoOne of the challenges that I ran into was finding resources for learning how to work with these tools. They\'re both fairly new services (API Gateway was just announced at the summit a week ago), so finding resources online outside of the official docs was not easy. I additionally ran into some issues with the Grunt tasks I was using from grunt-aws-lambda since it was producing empty zip files for me to upload to Lambda, but I eventually just zipped the files myself.Accomplishments that I\'m proud ofI\'m pretty proud that I was able to get this up and running in just a few hours as part of Dev Thursday here at Devpost.What I learnedI learned that I hate writing Java. As of right now AWS Lambda mainly supports two runtime environments which are node.js and Java. I couldn\'t figure out how to get NPM modules loaded in Lambda (Save yourself some time, just read this) so I decide I would just use Java instead and take advantage of all the built-in libraries, or so I thought. After struggling with Eclipse, and then struggling to install the AWS SDK for Eclipse (something something Data Tools Platform?), I switched back to node.js and bundled the npm modules as a ZIP file thanks to the guide above.What\'s next for Unofficial Devpost APII want to figure out how to add CORS headers to the responses from the API Gateway so that developers on Devpost can integrate this data into third party sites such as their portfolio by doing something as simple as:$.post(""https://iii3mdppm7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/UserPortfolioEndpoint"", {screen_name: ""MGerrior""}, function(data) {  // Add your projects to the DOM});If you try that right now the request will fail for security purposes since the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is not set in the response.Also, it wouldn\'t hurt for this to have more endpoints, or to just build an actual API for Devpost.Built Withamazon-web-servicesaws-api-gatewayaws-lambdacheerio.jsgrunt-aws-lambdagrunt.jshtmljavascriptnode.jsnpmrequest      Submitted to    Your First API | Summer Jam    Created by  Matthew GerriorSenior Software Engineer @ Devpost ', ' ', ' ', ""One of the challenges that I ran into was finding resources for learning how to work with these tools.

We all went to summer camp as kids, and Richard encouraged us to use that theme on the landing page and overall branding. Holly came up with the fabulous logo and color scheme, while Neal knocked out a basic landing page and steered the team towards the Jam / Jamboree language. Once we had a basic page, Holly went back and rewrote all of Neal's hacky CSS and created high-res assets mobile. Keeping it leanWe chose to keep the stack light, relying on only Pure, retina.js, and google fonts. No jQuery here.We also used deep-link.js to add a mobile-only What'sApp sharing link.

"BackPack","SAVE MORE ENJOY MORE","[2739, 'We all love money hacks. When it comes to renting a room during a visit to a place is a waste of money. We usually use a hotel room for refreshment and rest purpose which is fulfilled in at max 3-4 hours of stay. This waste our money as we have to pay for the whole day but there is solution for it. ', ""Backpack will maintain a dynamic record of hotel rooms. People here will be able to book rooms on basis of hour and they have to pay accordingly(not the whole price). Then can have there flexible schedule.How does it help out customer and hotelSuppose the rent of the hotel for $200 for a day. But if the person books through BACKPACK he has to pay as low as $40 as for 2 hours. The hotel will also gain profit because rooms are empty to book again. In this way on hotel end they can make more than $200 per day and at the customers end one has to pay a small sum.Revenue Generation For The CompanyAs per the scalability and different timings of year we would impose revenue from 3% to 12% of the total amount taken from our customers . A major share of revenue generation will be this and soon some pro features would be available which only people with our prime membership could access.How we will build itIt will be available on android ,web and iOS platforms .Team will consist 4 departments :-1 ) Collecting resources - arrangement of incubation center 2) Coding - skill developers working at both back end and front end3 ) Advertising - making contacts with the people and the hotel (very first will be bani park)4 ) Sales management - this team will keep an eye on market and accordingly changes the rent of roomsChallenges We ran intoThere are some loop holes like justifying the price of the hotel. Maintaining of hotel standards becomes difficult when there is checkout every 2 to 3 hours. It can create a whole lot of trouble to those hotels which have a large number of rooms. And at the same time dynamic data analysing is the soul of the backend of Backpack.Accomplishments that We are proud ofWe think this idea can break the pre-existing idea of 12-12 and also can be a good competitor of OYO like companies in coming days.What We learnedOverall it is good experience of finally seeing the idea come into reality.

"WiSign","WiSign is an ios app designed for people to learn fingerspelling in American Sign Language. We want to provide people with chances for communicating and understanding Deaf community with its culture.","[7540, ""Siyuan: Being a person who identified as a Hard of Hearing student in UW-Madison, I was aware that many people did have stereotypes against Deaf or Hard of Hearing(DHOH) people. Many people consider the DHOH community as an isolated community and they hope DHOH people could communicate with hearing people by spoke language. However, in Deaf culture, many DHOH people really enjoy communicating with others and they love to use American Sign Language (ASL) to engage in communication. Therefore, I want to use a mobile app to help people who are interested in ASL to improve their fingerspelling skills.Harry: As a person grow up with a cochlear implant, I can feel the world with sound or not. It's a very special experience and I want people to learn more about this special group. A mobile app would be a perfect platform to learn some interesting facts about the deafness, so I took Siyuan's invitation immediately when she asked me to join.Yuren: Actually, I did not meet many DHOH people before I came to Madison for undergraduate study. After I came here, I met and made friends with different people within the DHOH community. The more I get in touch with this community, the more I want to learn about it. Therefore, when Siyuan asked me whether I wanted to join her for this project, I joined without hesitation. "", 'WiSign is divided into two main functions, Quiz and StudyQuizThis function test how the user learns the fingerspelling in ASL. We fulfill this aim by testing how users identify different words by fingerspelling, combinations of signed alphabets, in different length-of-word ranges and send the words they inaccurately identify to review words list. Users can choose one of the four modes: easy, normal, hard, and evil, which contains words with length less than 3 characters, 4 - 6 characters, 7 - 8 characters, and equal or over 9 characters, separately.Our word list is generated from dictionaries in the Github repository and can be found from https://github.com/stoneotaku/vobmaster.git. We developed a python program to filter all the words in the word lists to the length corresponding to the 4 modes.Every word is shown to the users by images of ASL alphabet signs corresponding to characters in the words. The duration of each image is 0.5 seconds.We check how the user learns the fingerspelling in ASL by asking them to type the words they see and check whether they identify each sign accurately. The test input is not case sensitive. If the user enters the correct answer, the app will swift to the next question automatically. Otherwise, the current question will be added to the review words list and the images will be displayed again for users. The users can also put the current question directly to the review words list and see the answer directly. Users can take as many quizzes as they want.StudyThe study section has two parts, Study A - Z and Review.Study A - Z  part is designed for new ASL learners. They can view all the characters in alphabet order individually.Review part is designed for users to go over words they identified inaccurately or put into review words list during the quizzes. In this part, the images of signs are displayed the same as that in the quiz. However, users are not required to enter the words; instead, they can click the button to see answers directly. Besides, they can choose to remove the words from the review words list if they believe they master this combination of signs. After the user clicks the remove button, the button will change to the button for putting the words back if users remove them mistakenly. ', 'We used Github to work as a team and achieve the goal of version control. Each one of us has a task: Siyuan is responsible for UI of the app, Yuren is responsible for the icon design, string generator and image player, Harry is responsible for icon design, link images to string and view management. We started with simple tasks and tried to add features to our app after debugging the basic version. We always make a plot graph before moving on the next objective. Therefore, we communicate effectively and maximized our learning experience in 24 hours. ', ""We had a lot trouble with Github at first. Sometimes Github can't resolve the conflicts when two person modified same file at the same time . We solved the problem by always asking other teammates what changes they have made before update their own versions to GitHub.It's our first time to program in Swift, so we had to learn everything from scratch and develop this program in 24 hours. We had a lot of difficult times trying to create objects, connecting code with UI design, and switching from different view controller to maintain a good functionalities for our app. "", 'We are totally new to Swift and iOS app development and we developed the app by ourselves in only 24 hours. Also, we designed fantastic icons for our app in representing love and badger pride. ', 'Swift, UI Design, UIKit ', ""The current image speed is set to 0.5 seconds, we hope to update the setting and enable users to set the different speed according to their ability with fingerspelling in ASL.The current UI is only compatible with iPhone XR. We hope to improve the UI and adapt it to all the currently available devices.We believe that daily practice is important than Setting daily goals for the user based on their quiz results. We want to include motivations for users to do so. To do so, we may add sections such as daily challenges, rankings, and archives. We believe it is also of great importance for users to use the actual signs in ASL in addition to identifying longer phase and sentence. Therefore, we hope to use a large number of videos to train models to recognize fingers' and palms' movements by users. In this way, we are able to test whether users can use the actual signs in ASL corresponding to the phrases or even sentences.We want to help connect and enlarge the Deaf Community as well as spreading its culture. We hope to build an online cloud community within WiSign so that ASL users and learners across the world can get in touch with each other better.

"melon","Can't pick the ripest watermelon without splitting it open? Fear not! ""melon"" uses a neural network to predict the quality of watermelons through data collected by sound sensor and impulse deliverer.","[3705, ""We knew from the offset that we wanted to do a hardware-based hack. We began with the several sensors available to us that could interface with the Qualcomm Dragonboard. Of particular interest were vibrational sensors. After considering our options, we settled on using a sound sensor to deduce structural integrity and composition of materials. We decided that a great way to test this technique would be with watermelons. After finding a 2004 paper that empirically demonstrated a relationship between vibrational modes and watermelon quality, we realized that this project would be feasible. While the authors of the paper conducted acoustical analyses, we decided, based on the time available to us and because we felt it was more aligned with the spirit of HackTJ, to use a neural network to differentiate watermelon quality. What It DoesWe prototyped a portable watermelon quality sensing device that delivers a sound producing impulse through a servo and records the corresponding sound. The recorded sound is fed into a trained neural network that determines whether or not the sound corresponds to a higher quality watermelon.How We Built ItFirst, we opened Qualcomm and tried to boot it up. After figuring out how to use the DragonBoard, we began researching how to use the electrical components while also making the neural network. While this was happening, we also brainstormed a procedure to gather data and prototyped an arm that would be attached to the servo, which we later 3D printed. Initially, we used a spy camera and microphone, but because it didn’t work, we switched to using a webcam. Afterward, we collected data using the sensor, fed the data into the neural network to train it, and wired up the actual apparatus.Challenges and AccomplishmentsThe microphone that came with spy camera did not function correctly; the signal obtained from the microphone was not clean, as a result, the .wav file was full of beeping noises that rendered data uselessThe 96Boards that came with Qualcomm DragonBoard was causing kernel panics on the DragonBoard; we solved this by giving the 96boards an additional USB power supplyWanted to do a project on watermelons; did not have watermelons; solved by getting watermelons3D printed arm did not fit onto servo, filed down components so that they fitOvercoming hardware issues by employing gracious professionalism among peers: borrowed camera due to nonfunctional cameraNeural network arrays did not align up: kept fiddling till workedSuccessfully collected dataArtificially created a controlled simulation for bad watermelonServo was not strong enough so we used knuckles to apply consistent sound generating impulse to the watermelonCame up with a fun and challenging project ideaWhat We LearnedHardware problems that can’t be fixedGathering and processing audio data from microphonesLearned that python code can be super annoyingUsing GitHub, transferring dataDifficult to roll watermelonsLearning how to use Qualcomm boardLibrary-specific sensors to DragonBoardImportant to be patient when debuggingWhat's Next For IoT HackTJ ProjectUpgrading hammer/servoA more comprehensive training setExpanding fruit typeCreating a more portable deviceBuilt With3d-printer5inch-hdmi-displayarduinoautodesk-fusion-360c++kuman-ky61-micro-servologitech-c920-webcam/microphonepythonqualcom-dragonboard      Submitted to    Hack TJ 6.0Winner                Best Hardware or Other Hack                  Created by  Sophia Wangrichardwang1124Jude_underscore_BShasty88 "", ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['python', 'qualcom-dragonboard', 'logitech-c920-webcam/microphone', '5inch-hdmi-display', 'kuman-ky61-micro-servo', 'c++', 'arduino', 'autodesk-fusion-360', '3d-printer']","False","27","['sophiawang310', 'richardwang1124', 'jude_underscore_b', 'shasty88']","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/795/011/datas/small.jpg","False","0"

"Sobr","A keyless solution to prevent drunk driving","[8081, ""Sobr was inspired by the large amount of drunk driving accidents in the U.S. In 2017, there were 10,874 deaths due to drunk driving. Sobr aims to reduce this number by preventing intoxicated drivers from stepping behind the wheel to begin with and providing alternative methods of arriving home.What it Does?Sobr is intended to be an accompanying application for drivers to identify whether or not they are intoxicated before driving. It uses a combination of features detected through facial recognition to unlock the car, as long as the driver is classified as sober. If the driver is classified as intoxicated, a second (different) face must be provided to act as a designated driver.How We Built It?We began by scraping data off a dataset of pictures of human subjects before and after they had consumed alcohol. It was rather difficult to find quality datasets of this nature, and so, we had to make do with a small initial sample.Preprocessing DataWith small sample pool of images collected from 53 participants, we are asked to expand the datasets to avoid underfitting the data. First, we train a Haar Cascade Classifier to detect and extract facial features from the images. From there, we turned to image augmentation for machine learning experiments, based on which we write a script to arbitrarily apply 0, 1, or 2 special effects to the original 212 images. This technique of image augmentation allows us to generate a sample pool of 50,000, equally split between positive and negative samples.Research ProblemWe treat this as a binary classification problem where we identify whether or not the subject in the image is inebriated. We use iOS’s Vision API to detect the most prominent face in the input image, crop the corresponding bounding box, and feed this as the input to all our trained ML models.Prediction SystemThe first half of our prediction architecture is an ensemble of deep convolutional neural networks trained on different randomly sampled subsets of the augmented dataset. We observed experimentally that using an ensemble produced a much more robust and reliable result as compared to what we obtained with a single neural network. Every neural net in the ensemble had the same architecture: We have four convolutional layers that use a 3x3 kernel, each followed by a max-pooling layer that subsamples in a 2x2 area with a 2x2 stride. We use relu activations throughout the network and a softmax activation on the last layer. We used cross entropy loss along with stochastic gradient descent to find optimal weights for the neural network. We used high-memory instances from Google Cloud Platform to train our models since we required significant amounts of RAM to do so. After training, we used CoreML’s keras-to-CoreML converter to transform our model to a format that can directly run on an iOS device.Following through with our intention to build a voting classifier out of several different models, we built a classifier out of Microsoft Cognitive Services’ Custom Vision API on the augmented image dataset. We used the General(Compact) model type and used a probability cutoff that resulted in reasonable precision and recall values.Aggregated ClassifiersWe took a simple majority vote out of all the different classifiers that we use. Because this is a binary classification problem and because we intentionally used an odd number of classifiers, there is no possibility of a tie. The input image is classified to contain an inebriated subject(or not) based upon whichever class secures the majority vote.Challenges We Ran IntoWhen augmenting our dataset, we took a single image that contained four separate images and split the image into four separate images. For each image, two of the images were classified as sober and two were classified as drunk. When doing this, two of the images were mixed, causing our data to be skewed when training our models. The odd thing was that it performed better with the incorrectly labelled data.Accomplishments That We're Proud OfSobr was able to correctly classify intoxicated faces at 90.68% on the validation set. We do not at present have a mechanism to measure the App’s performance, but it still performed relatively well in our subjective evaluation. Also, we were able to connect to the SmartCar API in order to send commands back and forth.Our dataset contained just 212 images in total and we successfully trained a deep neural network that performs well on such a small dataset.DNNs are notorious for overfitting in the presence of small datasets and we overcame this problem through rigorous data augmentation and ensembling several models.We also achieved excellent performance on a challenging deep learning task that has not been explored at all by the community in less than 24 hours.We built a complete, end-to-end iOS application that utilizes the ML models that we built.What We've LearnedFrom the perspective of data engineering, we practiced expanding the sample pool with limited amount of public data available. In terms of data science, we obtained experience manually constructing comprehensive dataset from scratch and came to realize the precious value behind such establishment of such enormous datasets. Lastly, it was fascinating to become aware of how computer science can contribute to novelizing a traditional concept from the past to enable for infinite potential and efficacy well beyond the status quo.What's Next for SobrFor the next steps we would like to refine the model in order to provide more accurate results. Along with this, we would like to add more components to the entire system. For example, a camera could be added to the dashboard to insure that the driver of the vehicle is not intoxicated.ReferencesHermosilla, Gabriel, et al. “Face Recognition and Drunk Classification Using Infrared Face Images.” Journal of Sensors, 2018, doi:10.1155/2018/5813514.Koukiou, G., and V.

Not long ago I met the operations director for lean manufacturer that does contract work.  When I asked him his challenges he told me there were three.  First, he told me when they reconfigure the operations floor to transition from one work order to the next, usually it impacts any number of workstations, work-centers, machines, conveyors and/or robots, etc.. Sometimes, people and/or machines aren’t always available due to the existing work orders, so they need alternative configuration plans as well. They want a tool that allows them to virtually reconfigure the operations floor for a new work order as well as any alternatives before making the physical changes.Second,  they want to simulate the work order operations (and alternative configuration plans) to forecast a new work order completion date and time.Third, they want a tool that lets them virtually configure and simulate the manufacturing operations when they add or change out equipment, alter operations or come up with new ideas to try. When we learned about the Brilliant Manufacturing Suite, we were ecstatic!  This suite gives us exactly what we need to build a solution that helps this lean manufacturer and others quickly and easily respond to dynamic operational changes virtually. Hence PROS.  ', 'PROS provides operations floor engineers the ability to:Reconfigure and simulate operations virtually in 3D for work orders and the transitions between work orders,View Efficiency Analyzer information associated with the work order operations, Forecast the completion date and time for a work order given the current operations configuration, andRun simulations for what-if scenarios. ', 'PROS was built with the gaming platform Unity as it provides the ability to render and simulate work order operations in an immersive 3D environment. Using this platform will enable us to port this application to other platforms (i.e., browser, mobile, etc.) or run in Virtual and/or Augmented Reality. ', ""Working with new technologies always seems to present challenges.  I can't think of anything we did that didn't have some challenge associated to it.  Some of the more relevant challenges include understanding the API content, integrating with the APIs, figuring out how to associate and integrate API information with a 3D simulation and building the runtime editing capability for the 3D configuration. "", ""I'm proud to have taken an idea from inception to a developed solution leveraging virtual 3D technologies, which was fun in itself, but which also has the additional value of advancing the digital transformation currently underway in manufacturing. It's exciting knowing that this application is a step towards solving challenges in manufacturing today. I'm looking forward to where it is going to take me! "", 'When I started this project I thought I would have an application that was complete. During the process of developing the application I realized that even though the original scope was fundamentally complete, the potential for what this application could be and do is just in the early stages and far from being complete.   ', ""We are currently planning to:1) Better understanding of manufacturing requirements - I came up with the idea for this application after speaking with the operations director for lean manufacturer that does contract work. Before moving forward I want to better understand the needs of a variety of manufacturers in order to make this application significantly more meaningful as part of the digital transformation underway.2) Enhance existing functionality and capability - The current scope of this application is a bit limited.  After I better understand the manufacturing requirements above, I plan to vet potential enhancement ideas with various manufacturers to determine what functionality and capabilities would provide the best value to them. Additionally, we plan to address API endpoint integration performance which were not implemented due to the short timeframe of the project.3) Identify best platform for ease of use - Currently our application runs on PC, Mac and Linux standalones. Since we are using Unity we know we can build this application on selected browsers; Android and iOS devices; and in VR and AR. Again, before moving forward I'd like to better understand from manufacturers what makes the most sense for them.4) Incorporate analytical tools - Running a simulation requires data from the WiP and EA APIs in addition to the locational and animation data used to build the 3D scene.  Having this data available lends itself to incorporating analytical tools to optimize the operations which might include machine learning, linear programming, neural networks or other relevant tools.

Years ago, I was one of the first migrated customers. There was no dedicated iPhone app, so I made one which reads the voicemail system, stores the messages on the phone and can play them. The login is stored in the app. So when I got the Echo and there was no skill it was natural to port my app as a skill to my echo. ', 'The skill first needs an account link (login data for the ip voice mail system). Then it can query the number of messages (status), give information about a single specific message and can even play the recorded voice.

The skill script gets the authentication token from Alexa, generates the search id to look up the login data from the database and uses the authentication token to decrypt the login credentials. Then it can query the voicemail system. The voicemessage is provided by a third script as MP3 to the audio player. This script shares the server session with the skill script.

"Kinetica","Kinetica is an IoT device that creates a cost effective channel of communication for motor neurone disease patients.","[6611, ""2 months ago, my dad's former boss - Mr.Mittal -  came to Bangkok, Thailand for medical treatment. I soon found out that he suffered from motor neurone disease - a mild case of ALS specifically. I was awestruck by his condition. Just 20 years ago he ran large textile factories in Nairobi, Kenya alongside Indian businessmen. One morning, he and his wife came over to our house for breakfast. I witnessed the amount of assistance he required from his wife in order to perform basic tasks such as getting up, eating, drinking water, and even using the restroom. A few hours later, his wife decided to go to the market with my mother, leaving me alone with Mr.Mittal. Though he was able to partially move his hands and speak, most of the words came out to be gibberish. He was asking for something but I couldn't understand him. I wasn't able to ask his wife either because she would also have to guess and check what he wanted through the cell phone. After a few minutes of guessing, I finally brought him what he desired - a mere glass of water. Despite his medical condition, I was the one that felt disabled. I felt incompetent and powerless. At that moment, I realized that this was a problem worth tackling. Bridging the gap between ALS patients and their care takers was a paramount issue. I soon contacted my tech buddy - Mantej, who is extremely interested in studying biology and robotics - and decided to fix this problem!  "", 'The device is really quite simple. An ALS patient rests the arduino board on their hand. Whenever they touch a certain part of the device, the accelerometer is activated. They then move their hands in specified directions depending on what they need. As an example, if they move their hand a little to the right, our program translates that to wanting water. This data is then uploaded online for the caretaker of the patient to see (so they know exactly what their patient needs). The device uses a photoresistor to activate the accelerometer. Once the accelerometer is activated, it records the (x,y,z) coordinates. It then waits for an additional 6 seconds and remeasures the (x,y,z) coordinates. It calculates the delta difference between the respective coordinates (x2-x1, y2-y1, z2-z1) and checks for differences. All this data is sent to python scripts that analyze the motion. The delta values are then conditionally matched to some pre-defined gestures. From there, the gestures are printed online to a website. This allows both the person at the location to know exactly what the patient needs and for one that is in a remote place (ex. the wife of Mr.Mittal who was at the market). ', ""The device consists of 2 parts - hardware and software. For the hardware, we wired up an Arduino 101 with a basic breadboard, which consisted of a photo resistor, a 10k ohm resistor, and an accelerometer (adxl345). Whenever the patient would cover the photo resistor its voltage would change and send the data to the serial monitor. Whenever a change in the voltage was detected (below 850 in the case of the photo resistor), the accelerometer within the arduino was triggered. For the software side, the arduino would run a simple .ino file and receive the (x,y,z) coordinates. It would then wait for 6 seconds and then remeasure the (x,y,z) coordinates. This data was all sent to the serial monitor. From here, a python script using the serial library would use a baud rate of 9600 to connect to the serial monitor. It would save the data points in an array (of size 7, because 2 sets of (x,y,z) coordinates) and transfer this data into a .txt file (called 'output.txt' in this case). From here, it would also automatically run another python script that would analyze the delta change in the coordinates (see above) and based upon the changes form the closest gesture/desire. This gesture/desire would then be printed onto another .txt file (called 'input.txt' in this case). From here, PHP code was called that would transfer the .txt data to static web page. This was then modified a little bit using HTML5. The patient's desire was then printed to this web page and would be available for a person to view from anywhere (our's is limited to localhost for the demo).  "", 'Some of the challenges we ran into included: patient research, gesture movement accuracy, and connecting scripts. Motor neurone disease is a rare disease and has multiple different forms (ALS being one of them). Each patient can suffer varying degrees of this disease and would thus be able to use their hands in varying amounts. We had to set a standard amount they would be able to move their hand muscles. We also had to understand how to translate simple hand movements into desires/needs of the patients. We boiled them down to the bare basics to keep it simple: food, water, and restroom. Different movements would belong in one of the categories (we certainly plan on adding more when we receive more data). Perhaps one of the hardest challenges we ran into was connecting Arduino, Python, and PHP scripts into a single project.

"ECONDITIONER","We want to save water in California and built a smart air conditioning system that produces water.","[6740, 'Check out our Prezi hereWe used the Artik 10 Kit for this project.A lot of us have looked at various ways to save and conserve water. We, Team WPI decided to look at an option we believe is not fully utilized and is a source of water on a daily basis. The source, Air Conditioning. Each air conditioner has a runaway water pipe attached to it. This pipe essentially drains water formed by the condensation process inside the AC. Team WPI has come up with a way to harvest this water.We decided to focus on how each individual can contribute to this mission. This is because a 1.5 AC generates 0.3 gallons per hour while a 5 Ton Central AC generates 1 gallon per hour. Considering an average run time of 9 hours per day, a window AC generates 2.7 gallons each day while a Central AC generates 9 gallons a day!This trend has resulted in almost 87% homes with some sort of Air Conditioning equipment.  AC has virtually become a standard equipment of every household. Among 50 states in USA, California alone accounts for a massive 7.3% of air conditioning. A figure which is 5 times for than most states. This is because of the climate in California. California belongs to the region with hot/mixed dry climate type. With an average summer temperature of 90F and a year round temperature of around 80F, the high use of AC in California is justified.Let’s take a look at how this is a viable solution across the world. In 2013, a rough estimate of AC sales are approx. 900 million. A high volume of which are central ACs and rooftops AC. Together if we can implement E-Conditioner, we can save a lot of water and this in-turn will result more water available from traditional sources like dams and supply. ', 'We built and smart AC system that also saves water, as you can see in the video we can save up to 9 gallons of water a day. Even more if we optimize our condensation process. We use ARTIK10 to connect an standard air conditioning system with our own secure servers (try it on econtioner.me) via an MQTT protocol, we process information as temperature, humidity and most important the amount of water we save and its purity. We also add extra features to your standar AC system, you can program patters into the Econditioner, so that you also save energy. It learns from your ussage and can send you alerts if you are out of your house and left it on.A global solution ', 'We use ARTIK10 as the main processor in our Artik System, we integrated it to the air conditioning control board (got as much info as we could, but this is an ongoing process) to capture some data like temperature, we also incorporated sensors of our own. We then push this data to our server, that has a webpage on http://econditioner.me/ , using the MQTT protocol that is pretty common for IoT applications we get and receive data from our secure server. We can get useful information as temperature, humidity, water saved and the purity of the water and can send from our server to our Econditioner information about turn on and off signals and many features we are currently implementing (You AC unit would be able to turn itself on 30 minutes before you arrive home to greet you with a nice weather). ', ""There were many challenges we ran into, finding an air conditioning system that meets the needs for this project was one of them, we looked around standard AC units but some of them didn't fit our needs, we kind of used and old one at the end, but are looking to implement the Econditioner with a custom one, so that we can have an smart AC from start.It was also hard to use our own servers, planning databases, mqtt brokers and others was a challenge that we overcame at last, and of course keep improving the platform so that we can make Econditioner the new smart AC in your house.At last the final challenge was to save as much water as possible. We keep on working on improving the condensation progress of Econditioner so that we can save more water, trying to optimize this task to a limit is hard, but we are up for the challenge. "", 'We made one of the very first smart AC units. A user can manipulate and get feedback from his/her AC system from a computer, a tablet of a phone, you can turn it on and off wherever you are and also help solve the water crisis.We build a prototype platform for it, and a prototype product.The amount of water we can save is considerable looking at our numbers. ', ""From Cad Design, rendering, mqtt, to the more chemical part of this process, things like how water purification works, water condensation, optimized processes to obtain water from humidity. We also learn A LOT about California's use in air conditioning, we went to tons of data to make sure this project is feasible.  "", 'There are many more things to do, we want to optimize the water saving process to a maximum, having the best performance possible with minimal energy consumption. We would like to collect water from the fog too. Fog in an important resource of water that is found on the air, using it with Econditioner would be a feature that would make it even more attractive to the public.Optimize the platform and in the future launch a mobile app (It is currently a web app). Also add more features as intelligent control (the one we are currently working on)The sky is the limit, we look forward to keep on working hard to improve Econditioner.

"Stranded in the Expanse","Stranded in the Expanse is a sci-fi game that encourages fitness. You earn energy credits in the game by exercising!","[6930, ""I have always loved the sci-fi genre and games. One other thing I enjoy is running and going for long walks out in nature. Recently, my wife and I both got Fitbit trackers to help encourage our walking and fitness routine. We found using them to compete for the 'highest' number of steps each day to be quite addictive and fun.When I stumbled upon this hackathon, I was researching Docker containers and Kubernetes for work related purposes. I thought to myself: why not combine the already addictive Fitbit experience of competing for steps and walking, with a fun sci-fi adventure game, and use an online service running on Openshift to enable Fitbit to talk to the game on player's devices?This would provide people with a mobile game that is not only fun to play, but also motivational in terms of exercise and fitness.In addition to that, I could make the game experience even more fun/competitive by adding online leaderboards to the platform running on top of Openshift.Thus, Stranded in the Expanse was born! "", ""Stranded in the Expanse is sci-fi, action adventure experience that gamifies fitness. You use your Fitbit tracker device to help you progress in the game. The game encourages health and physical activity by giving the player in-game credit that they can use to upgrade their player's ship, in reward for steps counted on their Fitbit tracker. The online platform that makes this all possible runs on top of OpenShift's online platform.Players download the app from Google Play, install it, run it, and hit the register button to register a free account.They then do a 'once-off' hook up of their Fitbit account, to their Stranded in the Expanse account and perform an update of their Fitbit stats at least once a day.They login to the game using their registered details whenever they wish to play, and the game automatically converts any steps they have completed on Fitbit into 'energy credits' in the game, which they can use to upgrade their player's ship, and improve it.The aim of the game is to re-fuel your stranded ship by harvesting energy crystals in space. Once the player has harvested the required amount, they are able to play the end-game sequence and return home.Whenever the player wants more / better upgrades for their ship, the incentive is there for them to go out and walk/run with their Fitbit device! "", ""I started off using the MongoDB/Node.js template on Openshift. I spent quite a long time messing around with this and learning about how it worked, and how the network link between the containers was created. I also learned how the Openshift online platform worked, and how webhooks worked.Once I had all of this figured out, I deleted my sample / test project, and started fresh.I developed a very basic game menu and simple game prototype that just had a flying ship in Unity3D and got that up and running.Next, I developed a base node.js solution that was able to read from and insert values into my mongoDB instance. This part took quite a bit of skilling up, and I spent a significant amount of time learning about node.js and mongoDB here.Never-the-less, I found myself making good progress and just kept iterating on the game client and the online platform, adding an API manager to the game that was able to talk to my Node.js API. I built-in a way for the platform to register and login users, and authenticate them when API calls were made from the game. I plumbed in methods for the platform to talk to the Fitbit API and store any synchronized fitbit data for the player's on their accounts. I then built a way for the platform to communicate this to the game client.Once the core mechanic was in place, I began resolving all the game's logic. This includes things such as: player control and input, enemy spawning patterns / behaviors, attacks, player weapons, as well as the movement of random space objects and mining mechanics to collect space crystal with the mining laser.From there I added live leaderboards (total fitbit steps) for players to compete on and a way for the game platform's API to work with these, and added a message of the day service too. The leaderboards can be viewed online on the site, as well as through the game client. "", ""MongoDB and Node.js! I needed to learn a fair bit here. I now know what Node.js developers mean when they talk about 'callback hell'.I also ran into some challenges getting my game client to operate smoothly when making web requests to my node.js web API. I needed to figure out how to get these calls onto background threads, which is traditionally quite difficult to achieve with the Unity3D engine. I did manage this in the end though, and web requests now play out smoothly on background worker threads and don't lock up the UI. "", ""Completing a full solution from the back-end server in Node.js, and mongoDB database, to a custom middleware game API in Node.js to a full featured, fun client-side game on user's device. I'm really proud I managed to complete this full solution considering I've only had late nights and weekends to work on it around my full-time job and commitments as husband and father.Having a game released into the wild that is free, and that encourages fitness. "", ""I learned a lot about Openshift's platform, and the benefits it brings to the table. In terms of both easing workflows, and not having to manage Dockerfiles and complicated container networking.I also learned a lot about Node.js and MongoDB. "", 'I would definitely like to take this further. I think it is very unique (gaming and fitness!) and has great potential to go further.I would like to integrate with other fitness trackers next - like the Jawbone for example.After that I would like to spend more time on the gameplay and storyline of the gameplay.Then, I would like to add more online platform related features like daily challenges for extra rewards etc...

In addition, visionOS makes it possible to include third party API's into the app like Deezer, Snapchat or Swarm.All uploaded ads to the JCDecaux content server are then uploaded to the bus stations running visionOS. Ads have metadata configured before it is uploaded to the JCDecaux CMS. The data defines to which stations it must be sent (Finland, Sweden, France, Germany … maybe all. It is possible to configure targeting on the per-station basis). Vision OS runs the ads one by one and checks two conditions (questions).Should the ad be shown at this moment of time?What is the money proposal for being shown?The add to be shown is analysing the environment by using visionOS sensors API. The criteria includes: Location and recent news (near a conference?) -----> show a car adWeather ---> raining ? -----> show umbrellasBuses are late? ----->  Show a car ad if people are at the stopAnd any other criterias, the advertiser wants to consider. Apps have full access to the Internet and can evaluate any condition to get their value proposition right. The content and the way how IOT and third party API's are used are up to developer what generates a great space for creativity. "", 'We built visionOS with the help of Unity technologies and prototyping tools like Sketch. Along with the project we created the sample use cases for engaging ad campaign.

Using image recognition, Kenko allows you to track your daily intake of various nutrients including calories, sodium, cholesterol, etc. The application also has Apple Health Kit integration, allowing the app to store your health info in a centralized location. In addition, when you scan a food item, you also have the option of ordering more of that food item from a local restaurant. ', ""The main iOS app frontend is built in Objective-C, and the backend is written in Node.js. We realized very early on, after several attempts, that writing our own image classifier to recognize a variety of foods would be too expensive in terms of time and computational power. Instead, we decided to use the CloudSight API to help make this process a lot easier. We then used the context provided by the CloudSight API, and used the Nutritionix API to grab information about the food's nutrition data. The architecture of the app is very simple. The user takes a picture of some food with the iPhone app, which then sends a POST request to our Node.js backend (running on a Microsoft Azure VM). The Node.js backend then handles all of the communication with the various image recognition APIs and nutrition APIs. In addition, the backend also manages all user data and stores all past queries locally. The backend also aids the iPhone app in processing nutrition requests in the background, by allowing the iPhone app to send multiple images, and then receive the nutrition data the next time the user opens the up. "", ""We originally started by trying to write our own classifier using OpenCV. As we mentioned earlier, we realized very early on that building and training an image classifier that would identify various foods would be too difficult, time consuming, and computational expensive, as there was simply too large of a training data set to be processed and evaluated. As a result, we decided that using the CloudSight API would make our lives much simpler. We used the CloudSight API's Visual Search APIs to get context about food-related images and then later grab nutritional data. In addition, we also ran into latency issues with the CloudSight API, as the image recognition was a long, expensive process. We realized that part of the reason why the process was taking so long was because the images that were being sent by the iPhone app were very high-resolution, and also very large. We learned that bringing the resolution down brought the size of the image down significantly, and as a result we were able to get the CloudSight classifier to speed up a slight amount. The latency issues became less of a problem when we decided to change the intent of the classifier, being that the classifier would look for the main object within the image (in this case, the food), and not try and analyze all details of the entire image (e.g. the classifier would recognize additional, unnecessary, features such as the color of the table or plate that the food was sitting on).Accomplishments that we are proud ofWe are most proud of the fact of how well-designed and efficient the app is, as well as the fact that Kenko is now able to identify almost all foods, as well as retrieve the relevant nutritional data with a fairly small margin of error.What we learnedWe learned many things throughout the hackathon, but the big lesson of the day was that image classification requires a lot of computational power in order to train accurate identifiers (especially when it comes to training against a data set as large as the amount of food on Earth).

I’ve designed my own frameworks to build AR apps… fast—and I’ve also used a bunch of other modern programming frameworks. These are a bunch of RealityScript libraries I wrote on top of Unity C#. I built SnapGlass.es Share two years ago, but that was just a simple glasses try-on platform, with a 3x3 look comparison grid inspired by Warby Parker. That was also using OpenCV/Dlib from 2016. Tracking does not make all AR apps the same. Comparing that to this would be like comparing a basic dynamic website to an extensive blogging platform. The amount of work and the insight in software architecture to build the latter from the first is a world of difference. I built FaceShop.io last year before Facebook launched their AR Studio. Despite the similarity in name, for those who understand product, it is clear that my previous project FaceShop.io is very different from FaceStylr. Just in case, I’ll clarify the differences here: FaceShop is more of a “Photoshop for AR” - a general purpose creator software, similar to Facebook AR Studio or Snap Lens, but without relying on either platform. (It also includes a basic Flash ActionScript 1.0-inspired scripting language and a whole lot of things that would only be relevant for a professional creator tool.) FaceStylr is more like a “Polyvore for AR” - primarily a creative platform to discover fashion-related products and share product collections in a personal way that involves AR try-on’s. (Polyvore and Photoshop, though they both start with P, are very different - I hope we agree here!) FaceShop used the old OpenCV Dlib from last year with no stabilization. (And also allows the user to swap other face tracking SDKs, as it is tracking agnostic as a creator platform). ShopFace uses the latest OpenCV v3.4.1 and Dlib v19.7 and may switch to a commercial face tracking platform. Currently, a hackish stabilization with high-pass filters and optical flow is used.ShopFace has a variety of ecommerce and product and even referral link integrations. FaceShop was made directly for iOS on an iPad resolution device; for instant test-ability, FaceStylr was made initially for (desktop) WebGL.Simply summarized, FaceStylr is about creating AR Shopping experiences across the entire ecosystem, with benefits for both consumer and merchants to engage meaningful sales - and not just about creating arbitrary AR filters like FaceShop.

"RimConnect","We aim to bring native Twitch integration to Rimworld and other games via Twitch extensions, increasing viewer interaction and gamifying their experience.","[4777, 'I was watching a Twitch streamer playing Rimworld, their moderators were creating polls through the Strawpoll website, and the viewers were voting on these polls to trigger challenging events for the streamer. However the streamer was using the in-game developer tools to trigger these events and I thought at the time ""You could automate this"".That\'s where the idea came from, a way for viewers to directly influence the narrative of a survival game. Rimworld is a perfect fit, but I think we can do more. ', 'Our extension in its first release will attempt to achieve the above story, however in a native and automated flow. Moderators (and the Broadcaster) can create a poll, with options selected from a defined list of in-game events. Viewers then vote on their preferred outcome, and the game automatically triggers the winning event. This all occurs within the Twitch ecosystem via our video overlay extension, giving the viewer, moderator and broadcaster a unified experience; Never needing to leave Twitch. ', 'Our extension is comprised of 3 parts. The front-end is vanilla (yet modern) JavaScript and is very lightweight, we have plans to upgrade this with a framework (React/Angular/Svelte). Our back-end is a Node.js server hosted on a BaaS for simple scaling and links the game to the extension. Finally and maybe the most important component is the game mod, in our case hosted on Steam Workshop, which queries our back-end for any commands and executes them within the game. ', 'I am familiar with JS, Node, and Mongo databases, I have however never made a mod for a game. Rimworld uses C# and I have very limited experience with it. After the initial struggle of debating architecture and designing our authentication flow (How do you link the game itself to a server when it has no idea about the Twitch streamer?), our next challenge was learning how to actually trigger the events in the game.Luckily we have a well rounded team, and one of our developers (InfinitySamurai) was able to carry the bulk of the weight when it came to C#. Without his expertise this project would have been dead in the water. ', 'We designed an authentication system that uses cryptographic keys to link the game mod to our back-end, creating a secure channel of communication between the streamers game instance and our events server. Bringing this together on top of the complexity involved in having so many moving parts was truly an accomplishment for us.The first time we did an e2e test, and went from creating a poll to voting on options to seeing the item appear in the game was truly astounding! ', ""Releasing a Twitch extension is hard work, there are a lot of hoops you have to jump through to pass review, and what initially started as a very simple concept very quickly evolved into something quite complex. We are very glad that we planned far ahead and it has reinforced for us the importance of good design and planning. Don't leave your reviews to the last minute! "", ""We have so much planned for our extension and we are very excited to make a start, here's a short list of our planned features:Bits! We want to help streamers make more money from their content, so we plan to add the ability for viewers to spend bits to trigger events in the game.Loyalty Points! We want to reward viewers for interacting with our extension and the streamer so we want to allow a system for viewers to earn and spend loyalty points.Event Store! We want the viewers to be able to take full control of the events in the game and directly purchase items/events with their loyalty points.AI Hooking! We want to connect to the games story telling AI, to automatically generate polls to take the weight off the moderators and allow the narrative to still be told in a somewhat natural way.Finally, we want to keep going with this ideal, we want to bring our concept of Twitch integration to more games, we want to gamify the viewing experience on twitch and implement a system that allows the viewer to actually play with the streamer.

"The Endless Weather","What can you learn from your local climate? Where else and when else in the US is very similar to your favorite day?","[7945, ""How many travelers seek destinations with similar weather to their favorite vacation spot? Are you a golfer looking to vary the annual trip to Myrtle Beach, but maintain the same temperature? Are you deciding on family vacation spots, and would love a list of destinations most similar in weather to Cape Cod?Embedded in our fondest memories is the weather of that particular day - a beautiful day at the beach, a perfect day on the slopes, or a sunny day on the greens. What if you could find that weather again somewhere, sometime, could you find that memory as well?In 1966 the famous surf filmmaker Bruce Brown traveled the world in search of an Endless Summer. Spending a year locked in their favorite weather sure turned out to be a great decision. In the spirit of The Endless Summer, I set out to find my own Endless Weather with any conditions I wished, and determine where that would take me- be it Utah, Vermont, or even Wine Country.High quality local climate data is kept in many locations nationwide, but is often just used to help pitch today's forecast or contribute to the global climate picture. What other stories can this data tell? Here, we find out.The IBM Bluemix cloud allowed us to take temperature and precipitation data and turn it into information rich maps and virtual itineraries telling us where and when to be. "", 'Monthly temperature normals (average daily minimum, average daily, average daily maximum) and precipitation normals (25th percentile, median, 75th percentile) are imported into the Apache Spark environment.The data is first formatted through a series of map-reduce steps to create a vector representing the climate normals at each of the 1164 locations for 12 months, a total of 13,968 locations in space and time.These vectors are then compared to every other vector in space and time by computing the euclidian distance, a similarity metric, between the pairs.The resulting similarity values are then organized through another round of map-reduce steps to arrive at 13,968 arrays , each with 13,968 values comparing this time and place with all others (total 195,105,024 values).The results, both graphic and numeric, are presented through a mobile web application allowing the user to quickly and easily position the interactive map to the location of their choice (sorry, only continental United States this iteration!), select the month which they would like to compare against, and have the images shown, as well as explore several tables of data illustrating just where the most similar locations and times are. ', 'Apache Spark provides a Python binding, PySpark, which is ideal for scientific data analysis, given Python\'s strengths in data analysis, statistics, and scientific data libraries.Data from the US National Centers for Environmental Information\'s (NCEI) 1981–2010 Climate Normals were imported to the provided Object Storage. Spark Resilient Distributed Dataset\'s (RDD\'s) are created from these files and joined, then organized through a series of map-reduce operations, resulting in an RDD containing key-value pairs of location/month key and climate normal values.PySpark\'s cartesian operator comes in handy to create a new RDD that is a cartesian product of the original RDD with itself, with all possible pairs (195,105,024 pairs) of keys now represented and ready to be distributed.A method was created using the numpy library to compute the Euclidean distance between each vector pair and mapped to each pair in the RDD. Apache Spark held true to it\'s reputation with over 195 million vector operations taking well less than 1 hour.The RDD containing the distance between each pair of vectors, or similarity between the two, was then organized through a series of map-reduce operations, with the final RDD containing key-value pairs of location/month key and an array of 13,968 similarity values.Using the geographic coordinates of each location, maps representing each calendar month of the year were created. A green/yellow/red color-scale was used with green indicating very similar (go!) conditions and red indicating very different (don\'t go!) conditions. Total images created are 12 images per location per month, a total of 167,616 images. Each image answers a question such as ""How does the month of August across the US compare to my selected location in February?"" ', 'Demo account scalabilityHigh quality climate data is available for nearly 10,000 locations and available on a daily basis. The original idea was to compare all locations, all 366 days of the year (includes leap day). It was quickly determined that the demo account provided for the Sparkathon could not reasonably handle the nearly 91 trillion combinations that result from daily data at the full location list. The locations were trimmed down to only locations in the U.S. Historical Climatology Network (HCN) and monthly data were used to bring the scale of the demo into line with the provided infrastructure. I have no doubt the methods scale well with increased resources and such a large problem is still well suited for the Apache Spark framework.Limited Object StorageWith the intent of creating over 167,000 images, periodic transfer to an external system was required to keep the storage usage below the limit. ', 'Climate science is robust, but the presentation of climate data has been somewhat lacking. Such large datasets in time and space, combined with often complex statistical analysis of the data, can lead to a lessened interest in how to fully utilize the information. I believe this application, of comparing locations, provides a fun, inquisitive and information rich environment to both learn and plan based on local climate data.This model can continue to be refined to bring more data and targeted information to all. ', ""Certainly Apache Spark (PySpark to be specific). As a long time data scientist, numerical methods using numpy are familiar to me, but being able to distribute the processes via an RDD was a real joy and impressive at times. My development cycle was helped by seeing results (and mistakes) quicker than I would have otherwise. Seeing the power and scalability of Apache Spark was a great value in the Sparkathon and Spark will remain a tool I'll use for future projects. "", 'Daily data at all locationsI would love to extend the analysis to all locations and daily data using a much larger Spark infrastructure. Additional data such as wind and snow are available at daily frequencies and could really increase the value of the analysis.Global DatasetsWhere possible global datasets should be incorporated to not only compare the continental US, but all locations worldwide. By creating a comparison of all locations, any user could happen upon any set of weather conditions they can dream of.Incorporate travel costsTravel costs (hotel and airfare) could be incorporated into the results, showing the user not only where and when the conditions are very similar, but also where costs can be minimized for that particular experience.UI developmentWith Big Data being the focus of the Sparkathon, much of the time was used for data analysis. Revisiting the UI development to include native mobile applications and refined layouts could enhance the utilization of the output.

"Story Quality Add-On for JIRA","""It's time to get your story straight!"" — Calculated quality rating for user stories","[2957, ""User stories in agile development are the foundation of a development team's work. Producing and working with user stories of appropriate quality is critical for development teams. There is a need for common understanding of the quality of their stories. "", 'The Story Quality Add-On for JIRA checks and shows the quality of user stories.Its purpose is to help development teams identify and improve low quality and not-yet-ready stories,and possibly avoid starting progress on them.The add-on consists of a custom field and a workflow validator.Custom fieldThe Story Quality calculated field displays a rating of the overall quality of user stories. The field is sortable and searchable, and the rating is an integer value between 0% and 100%, based on different criteria consisting of the INVEST principles and other indicators. The overall rating is a weighed average of these indicators.A greater value indicates a more concise, complete, precise, and clear user story. The general idea is that the closer this value is to 100%, the more likely it is that the story is ready to start progress on, resulting in a more efficient process.In short, this rating gives team members an understanding of the quality and readiness of their stories.Workflow validatorThe Story Quality validator blocks all ""In Progress"" or ""Start Progress"" transitions for non-administrator users (by default) for user stories that have insufficient quality rating, that is, points less than the minimum specified for the project. This helps ensure that the team is working only on stories that are ready for development.IndicatorsThe indicators are rating the quality of a story (a JIRA issue of type ""Story"") based on different criteria. These criteria are designed from a developers\' point of view, because their work is impacted first hand by the quality of the stories.An indicator is calculating a point between 0% and 100% (inclusive), where 0% means the lowest, and 100% means the highest quality. The calculation can be any mathematical formula, but most indicator implementations are starting with maximum points (100%) and then giving penalty points for problems they find.See detailed description of indicator calculations in the readme.

"TSOLife","TSOLife is a online platform that allows users to record a digital legacy to leave behind for future generations","[5715, 'Everyone likes a good origin story, how did it all get started? The company TSOLife was incorporated in Sept 2014, but the concept was inspired decades before. It was inspired by loving grandparents, who helped raise a grandson from birth.My grandfather was a remarkable man, he had the opportunity to be an Olympic athlete, he was the recipient of the civic recognition award and he was inducted into his high schools hall of fame. His life is not only worth celebrating, it is worth remembering. The stories of his accomplishments could currently soon be lost. Verbal history dies after only 2 generations. There is no Wikipedia page dedicated to his life, no published biography documenting his many achievements; there is strictly what we remember.As it currently stands, history is only recorded for the famous or infamous, the rest are left to be forgotten. TSOLife was created with the conviction that we are all worth remembering–that life should be celebrated, passed down and remembered. We all deserve to leave behind a personalized legacy. History isn’t just for the famous or infamous but for all of us to leave something behind.While I have always felt strongly about this vision, it finally hit me when my grandmother passed in 2014 around thanksgiving. There is so much I never got to know about her, and even more I will forget. The only lasting legacy she left behind was her funeral service page. The notion that all that my grandkids will ever be able to learn about her is her name, date of birth, and occupation, haunts me.That notion ignited a fire: from that moment on I dedicated my life to creating a web platform that will truly allow our story to transcend time. I created TSOLife, and it will soon be launched nationwide in August. It is my greatest accomplishment thus far in life, and also my greatest regret because I didn’t make it soon enough for my grandparents. Their story is in my hands to tell, and I will do my best… though I know so much history has already been lost. ', 'TSOLife is an online platform where users can craft the story of their lives. For a one-time fee, a user\'s personal history is hosted and maintained forever through a perpetual funding model leveraging cloud storage. On TSOLife\'s beautifully simple and integrated platform, stories, videos, photos, and memories can be preserved for future generations, allowing the user to leave behind a personal legacy. The stories can be categorized, and will also be placed on a timeline of events and on an interactive global map. Users also have the feature option of creating their own family tree and personal network linking with past and future members of their family.A feature that fully captures our vision and embodies our idea of connecting to the future and past is the ""wish I were there"" feature. This unique function allows members to write a specialized message, record a video, and/or upload an audio file that can be delivered on a specific date or event in the future. For example, a personal message can be sent to a great grandchild, on his or her high school graduation day, or to a child on their 50th anniversary. TSOLife ensures the preservation of family memories and emotional connections and ties the past, present, and future together in a beautiful ever-changing story.Challenges we ran intoA primary challenge we ran into, was that we wanted a way to ensure our users that the information would be hosted forever and find a way to make that financially sustainable. We were able to develop a onetime fee pricing model that allowed us to calculate the cost of host information forever and by determining the net present value of the information stored and charging based on that number. We believe that once history is online it should be free to view for future generations and friends.Accomplishments that we\'re proud ofMajor Accomplishments and Awards:•2015: Carins Foundation Innovation Challenge winner•2015: Score Biz Fest winner•2015: Met Kickstarter funding goal•2015: Florida Venture Form finalisthttp://www.cultofmac.com/400088/tsolife-is-a-place-where-your-story-can-live-long-after-you-do/#more-400088http://www.news-journalonline.com/article/20150905/NEWS/150909709http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/technology/tech_check/os-stetson-story-telling-app-launch-20151019-post.htmlWhat we learnedWe learned that nursing home residents in the United States have the highest concentration of depression.

"HappyHour","Don't lose track of the night.","[2657, ""For students away at universities, it has become more important than ever to know how to take care of oneself. As college students, we are exposed to a variety of things, including alcohol. Even though we've all had educational classes or seminars in school about drinking safely, sometimes a gentle reminder can make a huge difference. That's where we came up with the idea of HappyHour, a pebble app that can keep you safe.  "", ""HappyHour initially asks users for a couple of inputs: height, weight, and gender. These parameters will be used to calculate the blood-alcohol-content (BAC). BAC is a universal measurement of the alcohol in an individual's system. It is a complex equation that our application simplified for each individual personally. From then onwards, users can specify a '+' or a '-' button, allowing them to keep track of how many drinks they've had with a click of a button. The BAC accordingly updates and creates a vibration, reminding them about their drinks. When the BAC is above 0.08 (the legal threshold for drunk driving), HappyHour creates a longer vibration, indicating that the user should take an Uber home. A click on the select button will trigger an http request that the pebble sends to our node.js server, where we use Uber and Twilio API to text the user information on the nearest Uber, time required to take them home, and estimated price. Challenges We ran intoDeveloping on Pebble Time was a learning curve at some points, especially when we were having trouble uploading color resources and performing GET http requests to send longitude and latitude data. Accomplishments that We are proud ofWe are definitely proud of parsing through the Uber JSON API data, as well as setting up Pebble Time to perform GET XMLHttp requests and extract information from that to obtain the geographic coordinates of the Pebble. The entire process of getting user-selected data and displaying the BAC in real time was also difficult, but we've learned a lot in the process!What's next for HappyHourWe hope to clean up the user interface code a bit (it's difficult to have good coding habits at hackathons!).

"bSmart Smart Diabetes Management System","Manage Type 1 diabetes through IoT technologies","[6226, ""Two years ago my 4 year old daughter was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes and since then my main goal in life has been to manage her blood sugar (BG) levels within an acceptable range. Although there are quite a few technologies out there that are of great help in the management of Type 1 Diabetes, I believe there is a lot more we can do to make the lives of Type 1 Diabetics and their care givers easier. I work in data analytics in my day job and thought latest technologies like Internet-of-Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning/Deep Learning can be of great help in the management of Type 1 Diabetes. In the quest for better management of my daughter's BG numbers I decided to embark on this project to build a system that will capture all the information it can, in real-time, and analyze it and suggest treatment options in an easy to consume format i.e. text messages on phone. This system, in its fully developed form, could act like an AI brain which can suggest treatment plans in real-time to care givers/baby sitters.Type 1 Diabetes is an auto-immune disease in which the pancreas stops producing insulin which is an important hormone for converting food into energy. There are 1.5 Million Americans living with Type 1 diabetes and it costs more than $15 Billion each year to manage this disease. Diabetes is the most expensive chronic disease in America today. Improving the care for Type 1 diabetics is not only good for the patients themselves but also for the whole society in terms of lowering healthcare costs.Typically a Type 1 Diabetic's BG goes up when they eat food and their BG comes down when they inject insulin via an insulin pump or insulin shot. The BG could go too high if not enough insulin is taken and the BG could go dangerously low if too much insulin is taken. Currently healthcare providers suggest insulin dose based on a formula which takes into account the number of carbs in the food eaten. But a true calculation of the insulin dose should also take into account other factors such as the type of food and the activity level to name a few. Making sure the BG level stays within range is a daily battle and any assistance with this would be of great help. "", 'The system I developed tries to integrate data from two devices namely an insulin pump and a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) every 5 minutes and uses the insulin intake and BG data to predict what the BG levels will be in the next 2 hours. If the predicted BG is too high then an SMS text message is sent to the care giver suggesting an insulin dose and if the predicted BG is too low then a text message is sent suggesting low treatment to the care giver. No SMS message is sent if the predicted BG is within range. This system could be expanded to integrate other information like activity, heart rate and ambient temperature all of which have an impact on the BG levels. ', 'Data from the insulin pump and CGM is read using a third party android app which stores the data in a mongoDB. I wrote a python script to read the mongoDB every 2 mins and extract the data and send it to the Azure IoT Hub. An Azure function listens to the Azure IoT Event Hub and stores the data in an Azure SQL Database. Every 10 mins another Azure function reads all the data in the Azure SQL server and executes a stored procedure to create the BG forecast. If the predicted BG is too high or low the Azure function sends a message to a Azure Storage Queue which in turn triggers another Azure Function which sends a text message via Twilio service. Bulk of my time was spent in building the stored procedure which creates the BG Forecast which is currently rules based but could be expanded to leverage machine learning. ', ""Initially I wanted to develop the python script to run on a raspberry pi and connect to the insulin pump directly but realized it was too much of a technical challenge to deal with. Hence I resorted to using a third party app and also used my laptop instead of the raspberry pi to run the python script.The prediction engine needed to be tuned to my daughter's numbers to enable it to make sensible predictions. To make the system more universally usable we need to replace the current rules based engine to a Machine Learning driven algorithm.The text messages were initially schedule to run every 5 minutes which ended up annoying my wife who was one of the recipients of the messages, hence I had to reduce it to every 10 minutes. "", ""This is the first time I have been able to analyze my daughter's numbers in real-time and take corrective action based on the numbers. Lot of people rely on rules or gut feeling while managing their kids Type 1 Diabetes. I believe this system has the potential of making lives easy and protect kids with Type 1 diabetes from the harmful effects of sustained out-of-range BG levels. Since this system relies on text messaging to communicate the treatment plan it can help non-technical care givers. "", ""Predicting accurately is a herculean task. It requires a trial and error approach to get the algorithm right. Always err on the side of safety when predictions are related to healthcare. It's a fine balance between sending alerts when most needed and avoiding annoying the person we need to alert. Again trial and error approach helps to get the optimal level of alerting.

After performing unit testing of these individual components we did a system integration to launch an android application that detects cataract. Since the machine learning component required the data to be in a better quality, we used some image enhancement techniques to preprocess our data. We could not get any annotated data online, so we collected the data ourselves from Google Images. We took a dataset of 60 patients (30 cataract infected and 30 normal healthy people). We divided this dataset into 40, 10 and 10 patients for Training, Development and Testing purposes. The most important feature for this study was the whiteness of the small ring of the eye. In Cataract images, the inner surface of the cornea is more whitish as compared to that of normal images. We also took into account the Big Ring Area of the eye. In cataract images, the outer surface of the cornea images is bright in color as compared to that of the normal patients' image. Also, we took into account the Edge Pixel Count. Canny method is the most powerful edge detection method among them. It uses two different thresholds (to detect strong and weak edges), and it includes the weak edges in the output only if they are connected to strong edges. In the computation of EPC, we counted the number of white pixels in the output of the edge detection. Now, with all these features, we chose the Unsupervised K-means clustering algorithm as out baseline Machine Learning algorithm. The reason behind that was having access to only non-annotated data. The algorithm divides the datapoints into two sections (or clusters) which are separable. The test datapoint can be incorporated with the cluster to which its closer (Euclidean distance). From the Android side, we used Material Design concepts to bring together a clean and sleek UI that helps to minimize stress when dealing with diseases. We provide educational materials along with out ML backed algorithms to deliver information in a straightforward manner. Users would get to know more about how to deal with cataracts. To ease users into the app, plenty of animations were implemented to guide users around the app, making sure that buttons are reused and minimal learning is required. "", 'We could not find any publicly available annotated dataset for eye images affected with Cataract. The idea behind having a labeled dataset was the ease of usage of powerful supervised learning algorithms. Since, we were not able to get the labeled data, we scraped images from Google Image Search manually and built a non-annotated dataset, for Machine Learning purposes. We also tried to extend this work over another eye disease Conjunctivitis, but we could not get good results owing to the dataset that we had. Since this is a Health hack and we do not want to recommend random suggestions to the patients, we decided not to include it with EyePhone. ', 'We are happy to present an application that tries to positively impact the lives of the people. Our application is at a one-click launch able stage. We believe our application would be a useful tool not only for the general population but also to the medical industry. We also believe that EyePhone is not only capable of detecting cataract at an early, but also acts as an interactive tool that helps to educate the general population.  ', 'We learned a lot about Computer Vision techniques and ways to play with image-related datasets. We also realized how important it is to do image preprocessing and image enhancement before we use Machine Learning algorithms to train and test the data.  ', 'We plan to launch EyePhone on the Google Play Store soon. We also plan to extend the EyePhone to incorporate other diseases such as Glaucoma and Conjunctivitis.

","[2703, 'One of our team members is from India and is aware of the struggles that those of rural India face. Based on his observations, and some research we learned that a large portion of the global population does not have documented medical history. This means that when seeking medical treatment providers may be unaware of things like medical conditions, allergies to medicine, and previous medical history. Our goal is to create an inexpensive, scalable system to allow access to medical records for all. By carrying a card (for example a government issued ID) with all this information attached it would speed up hospital wait times, ensure proper care, and expand the total population with documented medical records.  ', 'We created a system that reads a unique RFID tag which corresponds to a  medical record file stored on the google cloud.

This was our first time using RFID, so we took some time to learn the basics. ', 'We have a working system, that seems feasible. The RFID readers that hospitals would need to purchase only cost around $60 (INR 4300). The RFID tags cost only $0.10 (INR 7). These costs could be greatly reduced by buying the tags in bulk and using integrated PCBs for the hospital scanners. Currently a government issued Indian ID costs $0.70, so a $0.10 increase appears practical.  ', 'This was our first hackathon for two of our members.

"Super Creature Showdown","Super Creature Showdown for Echo &amp; Alexa is a game where super creatures battle, &amp; your math skills find the winner!","[5450, ""Super Creature Showdown started as a hand-drawn game that I would put in my son Jack's lunch box each morning. Jack is 5-years-old and LOVES all things nature. Every day he'd look forward to getting a new Super Creature Showdown. Each morning I'd work to make them more and more elaborate, ultimately turning it into a math-based game with the goal of being fun and educational. This past Christmas we got an Echo Show and we thought it would be a great winter break project to build out a voice-based game. "", ""Super Creature Showdown tests your math skills in a fun, 3 round battle to determine each creature's Strength, Speed and Smarts. In each round you answer by saying which creature had the greater score. In the 4th, and final, Showdown round you add up the scores for each round and say the winning creature's score. At the end of each game a fun fact is revealed about the Showdown winner.In keeping with the tradition of Jack's lunch box games, I wanted Super Creature Showdown to have a physical component. Each Showdown has a companion PDF that can be printed and used as a game board to keep score. Showdowns can be downloaded from SuperCreatureShowdown.com "", 'Super Creature Showdown was truly a family effort. My wonderful wife, Katie, teaches 2nd grade, and her insight into education was a huge benefit in helping make the game fun, educational and age appropriate. Certainly Jack was a huge inspiration, and even our 2-year-old, Luke, got involved.We built the game by starting on paper and working out the game logic and pacing. I then moved into coding using the Alexa Skills Kit SDK for Node.js. The SDK made it really fun to develop for Alexa, and leveraging Amazon Web Services made everything fast and efficient. I opted to have an external config file hosted on Amazon S3. This allows me to easily add new Showdowns without having to republish the skill. ', ""Time. Time. Did I mention time? I worked on development over winter break, so coding between holiday events, parties and just everyday life made for quite a sprint. Don't get me wrong, it was a ton of fun. Also, working on UX for voice is really challenging – Things you take for granted on a website, or in an App, really present unique scenarios with voice. On a whole, I loved every minute of it. I think there are a lot of improvements to be made, but we all think this is off to a good start. "", 'For me personally, I\'m most proud of how involved my whole family was in making this game. It was really exciting to talk about it as a family and as a team. My wife is really tech savvy and has a background in English Literature, so it was awesome to have her helping streamline the voice and language components. She also teaches 2nd grade, so having her insight into how to help structure the math-based game play was also a huge help. My son, Jack, was a rockstar\xa0– He helped with ideas, debugging and testing. It was really cool to see him watch the development process and how excited he was about it. We did a lot of tests with custom audio, so it was also fun to seem him learn about recording sound, recognizing audio as waveforms and starting to understand volume. Speaking of volume – Our 2-year-old, Luke, got a kick out of watching us all talk to Alexa. She can\'t quite understand him yet, but he\'s definitely saying, ""Alexa, open Super Creature Showdown""! :)  ', ""Wow. What didn't we learn? I've been doing professional design and development for 20 years and I'm amazed about the things I've learned working on a voice-based experience. I'm really excited about it and I'm looking forward to continue working in this space. For the rest of the family, I think it's a mix; Jack is really excited about computers, Katie is really excited about technology and education, and Luke is really excited about everything! "", 'This is definitely a 1.0 release. There\'s a number of things we\'re looking to improve. I know there are some things in the UX that need to be worked out. Also, some handling of utterances and intents. From a game perspective, the game has score keeping and custom audio support. We\'d like to better work that into the experience. Adding ""easy"" and ""difficult"" modes would be fun, too. Oh, and giving kids (of all ages) the ability to create their own creatures and battle against friends! Not to mention at least twenty other things I\'ve got jotted down on a notepad. :)Thanks for checking out Super Creature Showdown! It\'s a work-in-progress – We hope you enjoy our game and we\'d love to know your thoughts!

None of the current solutions on the market have yet have come to dominate and establish themselves as a defacto standard. This creates challenges for new communities when trying to select a system, often resulting in a perverse cycle of creating yet another management system that only sort of works for that particular community.At an high-level, these are the issues preventing widespread adoption of a single system:each system is often the result of a part-time or short-term volunteer effortsdifficult to reach a critical mass of users adoption necessary to sufficient generalize the systemchallenges in creating a critical mass of developers around the open source projectpoor understanding of global requirements (i18n/l10n, payment gateways integration, taxes, etc)hard for individual communities to evaluate the software quality attributes of a particular systemcomplexity in maintaining the software solutions and the data it generatesThis results in numerous problems, among which:time spent on management instead of makingredundant efforts invested in systemslack of support and long term maintenancelack of a defacto standard API to third party components (door locks)Frederic Bazin (founder of agora-space.com) and Ricky Ng-Adam (cofounder of xinchejian.com) with the help of Julien Choulet (a new active member and MeteorJS specialist) face these challenges regularly.

"Confucius","Confucius offers a revolutionary way for people to obtain information, giving users so much more than just news.","[6736, ""Confucius is the combination of Spotify music, Soundcloud, and breaking news in one package.The inspiration came from the fact that as university students, we don't have the time to constantly be looking for the best news sources. We also don’t have time to sit down and read the news diligently, especially when we are busy. Not only that, we found that with existing news applications, we were visually distracted while online, and were not able to just listen to the articles on these websites. We came up with an app that aggregates multiple news sources and translates their articles to audio, enabling users to take news with them on the go. "", 'With one tap, the user is able to listen to any article from playlists, trending articles of the day, and different genres from top news sources, in order to give the users the latest news on the go. Unlike other news app where users have to scroll through articles to read them, Confucius allows the user to LISTEN to an article. With our hands-free news app, we give users so much more than just news. We give users the freedom to be informed while on the go. ', 'Confucius is composed of three primary components: WEB SCRAPER, CLOUD BACKEND, iOS USER INTERFACE.WEB SCRAPER:     In order to populate our cloud implementation backend with text articles, we had to create a web scraper using Kimono Labs technology. Written in JavaScript and Python, we were able to crawl multiple websites ranging from BBC news, The New York Times, to the Onion and National Geographic. Using Heroku, and cloud logic, we are able to automate this web scraping process to grab the latest articles at regular time intervals. That way, our cloud database is always up to date with the top most recent articles.CLOUD BACKEND:     We implemented our backend data storage with the Parse API, a cloud database implementation. Following web scraping, we interfaced this database with iOS querying methods to easily write to and write from our cloud database. Most importantly, this database enabled us to populate our front end user interface with all the most up to date articles, hottest news article playlists, etc.iOS UI/UX:     In order to take advantage of our solid backend, we had to build a front end capable of reflecting all the information in the cloud to the user in a simple and intuitive way. Every part of our UI/UX has been thought about, and we have taken validated User Interface tips from other top mobile applications.     We decided that a Tab bar is the most straightforward and intuitive way to show all the pages in our application, taking only one tap to change from page to page. On each page, useful indicators enable users to intuitively navigate our application with satisfying swipe and tap gestures.. ', ""While we were able to complete implementing most of the features that we had designed in the beginning, we found it difficult to strike a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simplicity is always welcomed in terms of user experience; however, we felt that there were certain relatively 'complex' features that benefited the user experience. The only way to figure this out is from user feedback and we hope to keep incorporating data to maximize the user experience. "", ""We are most proud of the fact that we considered all aspects of a potential business when designing this application, keeping in mind that a successful app hinges on our FIT with customer demands/preferences, designing a product that customers actually WANT and that competitors have yet to MAKE.We take pride in the fact that we have placed deep thought about the business model, and how users will interact with the application.The beauty of Confucius lies in its smooth and enjoyable UX/UI, and we're proud that we have accomplished just that.We truly believe that users will enjoy the freedom that this application bestows on the user to be informed on the go, creating a product that other news apps simply don’t have. "", 'This is our first hackathon and the biggest difference was the fact that we had discussed about our ideas beforehand. Coming into Junction, we already had a clear, general idea of what we wanted to make, and as soon as we got here, we were able to utilize the available resources to implement our idea quickly. With this time advantage, we were able to concentrate more on the app design, UX, and UI, which gives our app greater leverage over competitors. ', 'With the basic features in place, we believe that Confucius is a differentiated product. We need to continue executing on our business model, marketing our application to potential customers in order to generate interest. Customers include those that would pay for subscription accounts with access to premium articles. In addition, we seek to generate interest in the advertising sector. With greater network effects from a growing user base, we think that we can generate revenue from advertisements in the long run.Furthermore, we will continue differentiate our application with more features:-Provide more news sources-Enable users to crowdsource article recordings of their own voices ']","['ios', 'parse', 'python', 'javascript', 'heroku', 'photoshop', 'kimono']","False","19","['keikumata', 'raghavkedia', 'michaellee94', 'ejyuan13', 'jaeraw']","https://firefly-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/usercontent/fill/242/161/cGhvdG9zL3Byb2R1Y3Rpb24vc29mdHdhcmVfdGh1bWJuYWlsX3Bob3Rvcy8wMDAvMzE2Lzg1Ni9kYXRhcy9vcmlnaW5hbC5wbmc=/Default_2x.png?signature=819e2e1456627816f813ed8ecd848b48b8fae310","False","2"
"CloudSonar","Let CloudSonar find an event you should watch","[4364, 'The critical event any IT service provider cares is a service outage(e.g. HTTP 5xx response). But there are just too many variables. uptime, Java gc counts/time, CPU, I/O util, swap memory usage, etc.Whenever you try to detect a service outage before it happens, you get screwed up by those countless variables.One day, I noticed Apache Cassandra uses a very simple metrics to detect a node failure, which is based on the following theory.http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~defago/files/pdf/IS_RR_2004_010.pdfThis inspired me to try HTM against simple PING response times to predict possible high load that could generate an error. ', ""It polls a given set of nodes by PING periodically. Then, record its response times, and which are fed to PhiFailureDetector and HTMAnomalyDetector to detect an important event to watch out.Please refer to Concept on my project for details.Case StudyThe case study I have investigated was done on a 6 nodes Cloudian HyperStore(S3 object storage) cluster. You can simply think of it as a distributed file system with a web interface. All the HTTP requests were routed to cloudian-node1, then distributed among 6 storage services. The traffic pattern I used was a constantly high traffic for this cluster, which would produce an error if some more requests had been added.To make it overloaded, a temporal random traffic surge was added every hour. Then, as expected, 6 errors were observed as follows.Now, the first question is if this tool could have provided a useful information based on anomaly score by HTM before they happened.The followings are examples against node1 taken on node3.HTM inputs, log10 of response time in micro seconds, looked like this.This looks there is no direct indication of such an error. For example, around 6:50, there were 4 503 errors. But no particular spike there. There could be a hidden pattern, but may be not. Let's see.And this is the distribution. 2.5 is around 300 micro seconds.PhiFailureDetector shows a server health. It is below 1.0, if it is fine. The lower, the better. You can set a horizontal line(threshold) to identify a bad node.Here, as you can see, there are so many high values over 1.0. Some spikes are even beyond 10(0.0000001%). This indicates that the server was under high load.A PHI value is a good indication of server health, but simply lowering a threshold doesn't really help. For example, if you would set 2.0, the first alarm could have been given around 22:10, followed by many more alerts. You may try 5.0 to avoid too many alarms. But you still have no idea if this is OK or not. HTMAnomalyDetector allows you to see a vertical line instead of a horizontal line(threshold), which indicates an anomaly, the time when unexpected pattern was observed against its prediction(max in the next 30 seconds).As you can see, HTM detected whenever a pattern has changed.ConclusionCloud Sonar is not an oracle, so can not tell when an error could happen. But Cloud Sonar is confirmed that it can give an anomaly whenever a pattern changes.If you look back a pattern when your server got overloaded, then you'll see the first point that became higher than its usual pattern. And it must be the first possible point you could be notified.So, the best way to deal with an unexpected event is to know as soon as possible when a change is observed. And it is what Cloud Sonar can provide. "", 'Using HTM.java, and Swarming to find optimal configurations. ', 'HTM parameter tunings.=> Let Swarming find==> Takes long...  HTM input scale.

"BZ - Secure Online Sharing","Securely save and share files through distributed secret sharing","[2786, ""Damian suggested looking deeper into Shamir's Secret Sharing, a secret sharing algorithm that could serve as an interesting encryption tool. Despite its potential use-cases, there have been limited real-life applications of the idea. Furthermore, such applications have been limited to only protecting strings. Hence, we decided to take this idea further and provide a SAAS - storing files securely using the same idea, and making it convenient to do so by abstracting away all the technicalities. "", 'Provide a platform for people to securely store their files. Files are encrypted (with the original file discarded), and the secret decryption key (which is also later discarded) is split into shares which are essentially ""keys"" that, when enough are put together, allow for the original key to be recovered. Gaining access to the files requires an adjustable number of shares that are combined together to form the final secret. For example, if the number of shares is set to 5 and the threshold is 3, there will be a total of 5 shares to be distributed, and 3 or more are required for the original key to be recovered and hence decrypt the file. This can be used in a variety of ways, such as to ensure credibility and also to make sure that files can be retrieved still even if some of the shares are lost. To further add security, whenever the file is decrypted, the decrypted file is promptly deleted after the user downloads the file.

"DD - tLaundry","tShirts taken to the nextTier(); ","[4633, 'Our entire team is from Tembusu Residential College. We often experience inconvenience when using the washer and dryer machine as we are not sure whether the machines are used. This causes our residents to waste an immeasurable amount of time constantly checking if the machines are available for use or have completed their cycle. Thus, we thought, ""Why not let the users tell others whether the machines are being used?"" This will help save our time and energy as assessing the availability of the machines is just a click away!  We have witnessed Telegram Bots improving our quality of life, such as the SupperJio, CountMeIn bot and many more. Therefore, we are inspired to create this bot. :) ', 'In Tembusu, there are 2 levels that contain laundry rooms. The bot provides information on the availability of the washers and dryers on each floor with the /check9 or /check17 function. Since the bot has a user-based system, residents of Tembusu have to use the bot to update the machine status. Residents can decide which washers or dryers they would like to use, update the bot, check the amount of time left and also receive notification when their load is done. Additionally, the userId of the resident on telegram would be tied to the washer/dryer, thus it is possible to send a message via the bot to the previous user to collect their clothes if they did not. Once the time is up, the washer/dryer would be available again. ', 'We wrote the bot with Node.js and Telegram-bot API, with the help of Firebase SDK. ', ""A major limitation of this bot is the fact that it is a user-based application. Without accurate users' contribution, the reliability of the information provided by the Telegram Bot may be questionable. We also find it difficult to incentivise more users to make use of the bot, so as to keep the machine status updated and accurate.Accomplishments that we are proud ofWe added a nudge function to nudge the last user of the machine to remind them to remove their clothes quickly. We find that this is a necessary function because some people may not remove their clothes immediately as they are preoccupied with other tasks. When users receive this nudge, they will know that there is someone waiting to use that machine and would go and clear their clothesWhat I learnedWe learned how to make a working Telegram Bot using node.js, linking to firebase and constantly thinking of better ways to optimise our code. What's next for Tembusu LaundrobotA possible improvement will be to install a sensor on the machines that detects whether a washer/dryer is in use. For example, it may be possible to detect a jump in the electricity current when a machine is in use. This will eliminate the need for user input to update the state of the machine, effectively overcoming the challenges stated above. We are aware that there is another group of Tembusians working on using light sensors to detect when the machines are being used, and we are planning to collaborate with them for future developments.Since there may be a possibility that there are faulty machines, we plan to input a report function into our code, such that users can report to the bot that a certain machine is faulty, so that other users would be aware of the number of machines actually available for use. The report function will probably change the status of the machine to unavailable, until the college is notified and fixes the machine.

"TruClinic","Delivering the tools and data healthcare providers need across all care settings and into the home","[8564, ""Justin Kahn was struck in the head with a baseball bat when he was 14 years old. In his teens and twenties, he would suffer from anxiety and panic attacks. When Justin was 27, he had a panic attack that scared him into seeking out the help of a neurologist. After working with her for almost a year, she discovered that he did not have PTSD. Instead, what he had been experiencing for 13 years, were seizures that were caused by the traumatic brain injury. She put him on an anti-seizure medication that alleviated what he had been experiencing.In 2009, he read an article that was in the speech that Robert Gates, the former Secretary of Defense, gave to the graduating class of West Point. He said that the Department of Defense was going to begin investing billions of dollars each year to address the PTSD epidemic plaguing all branches of the military. Justin grew up around the VA. His stepfather was an administrator for the VA. He thought that the way to address this problem would be to establish a relationship at the beginning of the service member’s career with their home state VA and have it continue into the rest of their lives. He knew from his own experience that the most effective mechanism for him to deal with his seizures, which can be similar to the symptoms of PTSD, was having someone to talk to. A lot has been done to address mental health in the military, but there are some service members that do not proactively address the issues they are dealing with. The reason is there can be a stigma attached with having mental health issues, as well as real world implications because they can be pulled away from their unit, possibly lose rank or pay, get passed over for advancement, or even be discharged. The result is, as troops transition to veteran status, some come back suffering from traumatic experiences that are having a dramatic effect on their transition back to civilian life. Justin approached the Salt Lake VA with the idea of having active duty troops being able to meet with VA practitioners from their home state while deployed, and have it be done through secure video conferencing. The VA agreed to test the concept of online care by teaching relaxation exercises to a small group veterans to see if they would have the same retention rate or better as doing in-person. When Justin received pre-seed capital in 2012 to start TruClinic, he approached his friend and software engineer, Trevor Wilkin. Justin Kahn/CEO and Trevor Wilkin/CTO have known each other since 2007, and have worked on multiple creative projects together. Brian Russon was originally introduced to TruClinic while he was with Microsoft and looking for Surface use cases in healthcare, of which we were utilizing with the University of Utah’s NICU unit. Brian joined the company initially in an advisory role for over three years before joining the company as Chief Revenue Officer. Lori Douglas joined the company as a result of her excellent work in the physician staffing industry with one of our investor/board members when we identified the need for someone to manage and grow our existing clients to ensure client success with our early adopters. Alex Zoller & Vitaly Leokumovich, co-Founders of Overl.ai joined the company in 2017 with the TruClinic acquisition of Overl.ai. Alex has over 10 years in the EHR industry and is now TruClinic's Head of Product. Vitaly is the co-Founder of IDEOM and Ego7 and is now TruClinic's VP of Engineering.  "", ""TruClinic connects the clinical applications and services healthcare organizations need to fit their unique workflows and patient population by streamlining communication between multiple clinical systems and services to eliminate repetitive tasks and data entry. Fast access to information when providers need it leaves them with the time they need to focus on patient care by staying connected with patients through telehealth technologies.TruClinic gives the caregivers the tools they need to provide the right types of healthcare services and information at the right time to best serve the patient's individual needs. TruClinic is used as an extensibility of the systems the providers and staff use on a daily basis. TruClinic solves the problem of patient management, patient engagement and patient adherence by giving the providers the ability to customize the telehealth experience based on their different subsets of patients. "", 'Trevor Wilkin and Jon Fuller/Director of Customer Support were the driving force of the first two iterations of the TruClinic platform. The first version was built on a LAMP stack using Javascript. Version 1.0 used a Flash based video codec. TruClinic was an early adopter of WebRTC for the video codec which was rolled out in Version 2, along with moving away from Javascript and into Node.js and Angular. Version 3 (code name: Olympus) is built on Node.js, Angular, React and Typescript.  ', 'We believed that TruClinic would be the solution that providers would flock to. The thought at first was to get customers, regardless of size of practice or length of sales cycle. We were not charging enough either. The positive side of the challenge was that we got a birds eye view into all different types of healthcare providers. The negative side was that we did not have a cohesive sales strategy and it was very hard to predict revenue. Small practices were easy to sell to, but they had high attrition rates because they did not have the infrastructure or budget to implement a successful and scalable telemedicine strategy. Enterprise customers have the infrastructure and budgets, but the sales cycles can be anywhere between 6 months to 2 years. This experience helped to shape the customer acquisition strategy and that helped us focus on hone in on our sales process.Fundraising was also a major challenge. As a small company where everyone is wearing multiple hats, the time and resources needed to fundraise were taking away from other tasks that needed to be completed. The executive team decided to raise the least amount of funds possible and to bootstrap for as long as possible. The whole team learned to operate using lean methodology and kept the growth in line with revenue. The company was not able to grow as fast as it had projected, but it gave us time to work out all the bugs before it was ready to scale. ', 'TruClinic was a winner of the Village Capital/VentureWell/SOURCE/Hitachi Foundation accelerator in 2014. The company is also an alumni of the Startup Bootcamp Miami accelerator in 2016. TruClinic currently has 11 employees and 7 independent contractors. The technology has been featured in trade organizations and publications such as The Advisory Board, AGC Partners, IDC Global Insights, the Journal of mHealth & Healthcare IT News. The company has two issued patents which outline the process for browser based online healthcare consultations (US Patent 8,718,245 and US Patent 9,374,394) with a third in review. TruClinic currently has 25 customers spanning 4 continents, in 7 countries and in all 50 states. ', 'The use cases for telehealth are as broad as the providers and the patients they care for. We have learned that our customers want a flexible technology with a modular feature set that they can scale throughout their entire organization. We have also learned that healthcare moves at different paces, depending on the priorities, budget, internal teams, etc. We learned to work with our customers to develop the strategies and deployment plans that will lead to a successful rollout. We treat our customers like partners and learn as much from them as they do from us. ', ""We will be doing a fundraise at the end of Q1/2017 for sales and marketing scale. On the technology front, we will be integrating biometric, biofeedback and wearable feeds intro TruClinic sessions, and will continue with additional EHR integrations.

"Driverless Arduino 101 Rover","A demonstration of vehicle to vehicle communication technology and active collision avoidance.","[15958, 'Many kinds of everyday automation exist in the world of today. Home control systems allow you to control lights in your house over the internet, coffee makers start before you wake up, and you can release a small robot to vacuum your floor.While not everyone may have the need for a robotic vacuum, or want to control their house over the internet, it is extremely difficult if not impossible to find someone in the developed world who will be left unaffected by self driving vehicles. You won’t even have to own one to have your life revolutionized by them. Public transportation will become driverless, traffic flows will become seamless, and people will even release their cars out into their local area to work as taxis for them!These vehicles will need to use collision avoidance systems, still being perfected today, to stay out of the way of obstacles such as people, signs, the side of the road, and other vehicles. This kind of system is adequate in today’s world, full of traffic lights and conscious drivers, but another technology will need to be proven before humans get off the road. This technology is vehicle to vehicle communication. Without this, driverless cars will be restricted to relying on local sensors, and the traffic jams of today will only become worse. Using vehicle to vehicle communication, not only can cars practice actions such as synchronized acceleration and deceleration, alleviating these jams, but can talk to each other ahead of an intersection to avoid a collision. The latter was the focus of this project.My project used an Arduino 101, along with some electronic sensors, to convert an old remote-control car into an intelligent, driverless vehicle that can communicate with other vehicles in order to avoid an imminent collision, along with being able to avoid simple obstacles. ', ""The vehicle has two main functions:Continuous Collision Avoidance ModeIn this mode, I simply send the vehicle an “On” signal through bluetooth, and it turns on the rear motor. I can then step back and watch it avoid trees, houses, chairs people, and just about anything else it encounters in its path. The vehicle can successfully navigate an obstacle course on its own.Demo of Driverless Vehicle to Vehicle Communication in an IntersectionThis mode exists to show what an intersection between two cars might look like in a future with vehicle to vehicle communication. The scenario goes as follows: Two cars, at least one of them driverless, are approaching an intersection of two roads, one vehicle traveling on each road. When the driverless car receives information indicating the other car is approaching dangerously from the other road, it slows down and/or stops to avoid a collision. In this mode, I can connect the driverless Arduino 101-powered vehicle to another vehicle with an onboard computer. The other vehicle is a simple RC car being controlled by a human being, with an onboard computer running linux that is bluetooth enabled. This mode is tested in the following way: the two vehicles are connected and sent on a possible collision course. The Arduino receives GPS information from the RC vehicle, and determines if the two are headed for a collision. If so, the Arduino vehicle will stop and let the RC vehicle pass by.How It WorksThe vehicle is built upon an old hobbyist remote-control car chassis, and uses the servo motor, motor controller, battery, and rear motor of the vehicle. The Arduino 101 serves as the brain of the vehicle, processing input from different kinds of sensors.Continuous Collision Avoidance ModeWhen powered on, the Arduino becomes visible to bluetooth devices. I wrote an iOS application using Swift and loaded it onto an iPad. The application is simply a switch in the center of the screen that appears upon connecting with the Arduino 101. The switch represents a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) characteristic. When the switch is off, it sets the characteristic to 0, and when it is on, it sets the characteristic to 1. 20 times a second, the Arduino does two things. The first thing is check the state of the characteristic. If the characteristic is 0, it shuts off its rear motor and stops checking for collisions. If the characteristic is 1, it turns the rear motor on and starts checking for collisions. The second thing the Arduino does is, as already mentioned, check for collisions. It does this using three ultrasonic sensors placed in the front of the vehicle. One of the sensors is facing directly in front of the vehicle, and the other two are angled to the left and right of the direction the vehicle is facing. If a distance is measured by one of the sensors that is considered dangerous, the Arduino will check the offset sensor readings for a clear path, and turn in the direction that gives it the most space.Demo of Driverless Vehicle to Vehicle Communication in an IntersectionThere are two cars involved in this demonstration. The first is the self-driving Arduino 101 powered rover, and the second is a regular, human controlled RC car with a raspberry pi and a GPS on board. The cars are placed away from each other and oriented so that they will both converge on the same point, like an intersection. I then remotely run a python script I wrote on the raspberry pi, which connects with the Arduino through bluetooth, and once connected, writes the vehicle's track angle to the bluetooth characteristic. Once connected, the Arduino starts moving, and the human drives the raspberry pi car into the path of the Arduino. After a delay of a couple seconds, the Arduino car reads its own track angle (the direction it’s moving) from its GPS and the other car’s track angle over bluetooth. The Arduino then decides whether or not the cars could collide. If a collision is possible, the Arduino stops and lets the raspberry pi car pass.Challenges I ran intoThere were so many challenges involved with carrying out this project, and some of the most difficult were not even software related!In the beginningI like to divide my projects up into individual tests that demonstrate the different technologies needed to complete the project, and then bring them all together. One of the first tests, reverse engineering the motor controller, proved to be quite challenging. Since the controller was designed to be controlled via a radio receiver, not much documentation exists as to which input produces which output. I had to sit down and write some test programs that looped through different analog outputs and tested different PWM pulse lengths in order to find which ones caused the motor to run at different speeds or spin in different directions.Simple electronics can sometimes be not so simpleProbably the most significant problem that took up entire days of work on this project was caused by the power supply. Initially, I discovered that the controller had a 5 volt output pin, supplied by the motor battery, and attempted to use this to power the vehicle components. However, I soon found out that with many sensors, a GPS, an Arduino, and a servo motor, the output was simply not powerful enough, and this caused a lot of weird behavior. After hours of fiddling with the hardware, I ended up using a USB power bank to power the Arduino, and using the motor controller output to power the rest of the vehicle. Since a lot of the power was used in outputting signals from the Arduino, this solution worked very nicely.GPS nightmareI used two Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout Boards for this project, and would recommend them to anyone else in a heartbeat. However, unfortunately, I found that my Arduino 101 hardware serial did not work with them, and I ended up having to write my own GPS library including an NMEA sentence parser in order to work with them. I was able to get them to work using SoftwareSerial, and I plan to upload my library and solution to GitHub in order to help out anyone else who may come across the same dilemma.AccomplishmentsCreating a Reliable Obstacle Avoidance SystemI started out just giving the rover the ability to dodge small obstacles in its path. Now, with my most updated code, the rover almost looks alive when weaving through an obstacle course.Demonstrating Vehicle to Vehicle CommunicationThe Arduino 101 powered rover successfully stops on analysis of data transmitted from another moving vehicle near it.I also found out some useful things about vehicle to vehicle communication. The intersection demonstration uses the track angles of the rovers to determine if they will collide. In a real world application, a more advanced system would need to be deployed, as explained below, since a system only using the two track angles has the potential to calculate false positives. Through tests of more advanced systems that used more measurements from the GPS and more sophisticated ways to calculate a potential collision, I learned a lot about this technology. 1) Bluetooth does not have the range to support this communication in full. Bluetooth also takes time to connect, and does not reliably stay connected between two moving vehicles even if they are in range.2) A more accurate method of location must be used in order to implement full collision detection in an intersection using more than just track angles. Either a much more accurate GPS is required, or more likely, an assisted GPS system possibly using cell towers.Why this is so:If the Raspberry Pi supported a larger bluetooth range, the vehicles could have been started at a greater distance from each other, and more information could have been collected up to the intersection, allowing for a more accurate collision avoidance calculation. I attempted demonstrations where the vehicles start out of bluetooth range, building up a history of data as they move, and connect once in range, but the bluetooth technology on board the Raspberry Pi had lots of trouble connecting the two vehicles while they were moving. I wrote an Arduino sketch that read both vehicles' latitude, longitude, speed, and track angle, and used their position history to plot their paths as lines on an Equirectangular Grid Model of the Earth. The Arduino then found the intersect of the lines, and used the two vehicles' velocities to determine if they would be at the intersection at the same time. This demonstration worked using test values, but the aforementioned limitations of the GPS and Bluetooth hardware led to inaccurate and untimely readings. In order to be utilized in a real intersection between two cars, these calculations would need to be supplied with data from an assisted GPS and a larger Bluetooth range.What I learnedArduino!I had never touched an Arduino before this project, and I have come to love how easy it is to automate things with one.C++Before this project I had worked with Java, Swift, Python, PHP, and SQL, but my past projects did not require any programs written in C++. Since the Arduino compiles C++, I learned a lot about the language, especially when writing the GPS library and NMEA sentence parser.NMEA DataIt was very cool to learn what most GPSs output, and how to interact with the GPS in order to get the information desired.Bluetooth Low EnergyI had always had a small fascination with bluetooth, and writing code that worked with it was very cool to me. I enjoyed how easy the Arduino 101 BLE API was to use.PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)I had used PWM in the past to control servo motors, but this project took me into the details of it. I learned the different between PWM frequency, duty cycle, and pulse length.What's next for Self Driving Arduino RoverStarting my first year of college in about a month, there will be many more resources for me to use in developing my projects. This will open up many possibilities to where this could go. I plan to continue developing the rover, adding different sensors to it and giving it new and improved capabilities. In college and beyond, I will use my knowledge of GPS, BLE, micro controllers, and more gained during this project to aid future efforts in making this planet a safer, more efficient, and more exciting place to live.Testing InstructionsContinuous Collision Avoidance ModePlace the rover in a fairly open area (such as a playground, backyard, gymnasium, etc), with at least 2 meters of space in between the front of the vehicle and the nearest obstacleSupply power to the Arduino by plugging in the cable attached to the power supply, and turn on the Electronic Speed ControlWait 5-15 secondsOpen iPad Rover Controller ApplicationWait for on/off switch to appear in center of iPad screenTurn switch on to start the back motor of the rover and enable collision avoidanceThe rover should start moving forwards and turning its front wheels left or right when it approaches an objectVehicle to Vehicle Communication Intersection DemonstrationPlace the driverless Arduino rover and the RC raspberry pi rover about 9 meters apart (try closer if the vehicles are failing to connect, the raspberry pi 3 has a relatively small bluetooth range)Orient the two vehicles such that they are pointing towards a common point, from directions around 90 degrees relative to each otherPlug the raspberry pi and the Arduino, turning the two devices on, and turn on the Electronic Speed Control on the Arduino roverWait until both GPSs indicate a fix (when the blinking red light on the GPS starts blinking much less frequently)SSH into the raspberry pi and start the intersection demo python programOnce the Arduino rover starts moving, using the Remote Control, drive the raspberry pi rover into the path of the Arduino rover, so that they are on a collision path and moving in directions around 90 degrees relative to each otherDo not stop raspberry pi rover; drive it straight through the intersectionThe Arduino rover should now stop and let the raspberry pi rover passNote: for both the sketches, the pulse length that determines the speed of the Arduino rover is defined by a C++ macro.

Such thing inspires us to solve the bad culture by developing an android-based application.During the development process, we investigate and discuss with those people who likes “ngaret” and found that there are two factors caused which is Internal and External factors. We define the Internal factor caused such as habit (or we call it previously as culture), laziness, and forget, while the external factors are traffic, accident, or natural disasters.Referring to the above factors, we assume that the main reason of the “ngaret” is “HABIT” and the only solution is moving on and realizing the negative effects if we do our activity “ngaret” instead of being punctual.

"Guru","A mobile app that utilizes live streaming technology to bring students high-class education in an effective manner","[7603, ""In today's world, there are experts in every field. Your neighbors, your best friends, people you see every day or those you have never met could be possible experts or at least knowledgeable in the field of your question. Instead of having to find clunky explanations online, search and filter through hours of youtube content, or even set up meetings with tutors days in advance to understand concepts, problems or doubts, Guru saves the day.  "", 'Guru is a native iOS application that utilizes live streaming instructional technology that instantaneously connects students with ""Gurus"" in an effective learning environment. If you ever had to ask a quick question or understand a certain topic, Guru is the app for you. You sign in to the application stating what topics you\'re comfortable teaching. You can either ask a question to a global audience of gurus or you can see a list of questions that students are asking related to your skills. Gurus receive instantaneous push notifications or in-app alerts that their presence is requested. When the guru accepts the student\'s question, they are both simultaneously taken into a Live Video Call, through which the guru can explain the problem. We have seamlessly integrated a collaborative whiteboard in the stream, allowing the guru to draw on the screen and explain difficult concepts.  ', 'Guru is a native iOS app backed with a nodeJS powered Parse Server, a popular open source deployment framework. We host our server on Heroku’s powerful infrastructure which allows us to easily deploy new server side changes via a git command line and manage performance in an integrated environment. For the client side languages, most of the app is written in Apple’s Swift 3.0 with Objective C libraries as well. Cocoapods was our dependency manager and proved to be very useful in organizing the external packages we used. For live video streaming/conferencing, we used Twilio to deliver fast and reliable content streams connecting the Guru and student. There is native Twilio code running in the app, as well as a server component hosted on our backend for authenticating users with the service before granting them access to a session. The real time whiteboard that is provided during a call is powered by the open source Live Query server project which facilitates web socket connectivity for efficiently sharing coordinate points across devices to create the effect a continuous line is being drawn live. A separate portion of our Heroku instance (dyno) manages this live websocket system. We use a MongoDB database hosted on MLab which has proven to be fast and very adaptable to our needs. ', 'Setting up the Live Video StreamAside from coming up with the idea for Guru (which took over 3 hours between all of us), we faced two main technical challenges. They consisted of implementing a video chat service in our app along with having a live whiteboard to draw on during a video call. At first, the idea of a video chat system seemed daunting and we researched possibilities of transcoding and delivering our own content across infrastructure providers such as AWS, but in the end Twilio was found to be a less difficult way to build out this feature while allowing time to focus on the app and interface. We coded a demo app before integrating video with the main Guru platform and divided up tasks such as researching various APIs, efficient server management with video, and designing/developing user interfaces for the product. Integrating a Collaborative WhiteboardWe thought this would be the most difficult feature, but as we soon found out an even harder task was to build the dynamic drawing system. This required setting up a continuous websocket connection to avoid unnecessarily polling a server for new points to download and wasting precious resources. Parse’s newly open sourced Live Query project was slightly complicated and had minimal documentation but after many hours we figured out how to receive subscription alerts for newly updated points and were able to complete this feature. There were many other smaller challenges such as how to properly assign and delegate tasks among our group, as well as when to sleep (if at all!), but we are happy to have a finished product and to have overcome these challenges. ', ""Guru is a near-complete application. We delivered on all our promises, a fully functional and instantaneous live stream viewer, a fleet of push notifications to alert Gurus of requests and the integration of a collaborative whiteboard in the live stream to ensure a better learning experience for the student. The fact that we were able to complete this in a mere 36 hours speaks volumes. We're extremely proud that we were able to get this far, to get this functional app that allows anyone, anywhere to connect with a guru who could be anywhere in the World and still learn valuable information with ease. Developing this app seemed impossible in the beginning, but one by one, as we finished off tasks and created features, everything came together in the end.  "", ""The most important thing we learned is team-driven collaboration and the division of tasks to ensure maximum productivity. With such a complex app such as Guru, it was imperative we all were on the same page, focusing on different areas of the application and tying them in at the end into one superb app. This meant raging through intense git merges, trying to manage 3 people working on the same Xcode project and resolving major conflicts that seemed impossible. At the end of the day, however, we did it together and that's what matters.   "", ""The future of Guru is unlimited. We plan to publish this app in to the Apple App Store and promote this app between high school students and college students alike. The use case for this application is truly present - any person who has a doubt, a problem or a confusion can post a question in a couple of seconds, and 5 seconds later be talking to a Guru who's walking the student through what he or she needs to do. We hope to engage in productive conversations with students and leaders in the education industry to see how Guru can be a fit for teachers and students alike, gaining tractions and pushing this app to its limits.

I found the Alexa Skills Challenge on Devpost and put my registration in. So, I created this AI based Doctor that gives a user his/her diagnosis based on the symptoms. I knew that there are no existing apps in the market for public use that even remotely gives the user a steady description. I did my research. This allowed my to think freely and move in towards building my code. Hence, I built Medical Assistant. I kept the name simple as it is what it's name sounds to be. "", ""Medical Assistant is a skill with the most user friendly voice interaction model. To keep the user interested and satisfied I kept the number of questions to a minimum and gave a more precise answer. I really had to work on a better user experience. The Skill takes the input from the user about medical conditions and gives them a description about it's rarity and severity along with which department of doctors they should go see. But the USP of the skill is actually the Diagnosis based on Symptoms. Based on the user's statement, the skill asks follow up questions till it reaches a decision and finalizes the medical condition the user may be having and then suggests it and also recommends which type of doctor they should go see. This is something out-of-the-box and completely different from anything that exists in the market. It has over 10,000 follow up questions and the content is completely dynamic. "", 'I build the code using Node.js where I used REST API services and a self generating code body for handling follow-up questions. I built the code through Jenkins and Deployed it to AWS Lambda. I used a simple Atom Editor to code and my testing environment was EchoSim.io and the App on Android Playstore called Reverb. ', ""The basic challenge was accuracy. Sometimes even Alexa fails to understand the exact user utterance depending on ambient noise , accent and network issues. My skill had to be reliable and precise so I had to add a secondary layer of Natural Language Processing on top of Alexa's existing Intent builders and NLP engine. I did this with over 1600 slot values and handling a bulk of individual string variations in my code.The second challenge was the probability counter. My skill, Medical Assistant only gives the diagnosis when that probability counter reaches over 97% for any medical condition. This was done by careful mapping of medical conditions with their symptoms. It took me almost 2 months just to do that. Eventually I cracked the code and successfully made the entire package up and running. "", ""The final product is something exactly the one I had in my mind and hoped to build. Getting something exactly right as it is in mind and looking at your code built from scratch running flawlessly is an achievement on it's own. I've even gone ahead and showed it to several doctors who were really hyped and happy about it. People are really happy I'm giving away such a skill for free where enterprises actually charge people money for something like this. "", ""Thanks to this Alexa Skills Challenge 2017, I also got the drive to learn something new. In this regard, I learnt Node.js, Express.js as well as Alexa SDK and about AWS Lambda's Serverless platform. These skills came very handy some interviews as well. "", ""Medical Assistant will grow with time. I'll keep adding more modules to it like Searching nearby locations via Google Places APIs and giving contacts of Doctors as cards in Alexa Companion App, An AI based Diet Builder based on eating habits as well as Binaural Music to keep moods in check for Mentally Challenged People. I do have a plan. If I win this hackathon, I'm going to build this entire package and use that prize money to have premium API Services and Libraries and still keep the Skill Free for the Public so that people get what the need and deserve, A healthier and a better lifestyle.

I have studied music technology about ten years ago, so I felt a bit rusty creating the loops, but It was a great opportunity to catch up with some of my old college buddies to run my ideas past them and to get their feedback.There is also a known issue that I have encountered where card text overrides APL on the echo spot. I used to excellent Slack community to confirm this was a bug, and not me going mad!

"", 'So many things, where do I start? I have definitely learned lots of new coding techniques, including how to debug errors, but probably the thing I have learnt most is how valuable it is to network, share your ideas with others, get feedback early on and then to hands on beta testing performed.

"ConnectOnCommute","ConnectOnCommute is solving the problem of loneliness and disconnection by facilitating interactions with strangers","[5334, 'I was inspired to create ConnectOnCommute after experiencing my own new tribe moment moving out to Boston. I found it very challenging to break out and meet new people, make new friends, and really feel like I \'belonged\' in my community here. After a few weeks of feeling increasingly disconnected from my environment, I decided to put on a namebadge that said ""Ask me about tacos"". Within the 4 hours I had been wearing the badge, 14 different people would jokingly walk up and.. well.. ask me about tacos. Before I knew it I was having a random conversation with almost each one of them. After talking to some other people about my feelings at the beginning of my journey here, I found that I wasn\'t alone in feeling alone. It turns out 48% of Americans feel lonely most or all of the time, and 52% feel that no-one knows them well. Our brains have evolved to need social acceptance in much of the same way that we need food and oxygen- and it\'s because of this that many studies agree chronic loneliness can be more detrimental to our health than obesity and equivalent to smoking a pack of cigarettes a day.When I got to #HackHarvard2019, I had spent a lot of time thinking about that experience and wanted to see how my team could use tech to help foster a world of more deep, meaningful connections. Social media does a great job maintaining friendships once they start, but there\'s somewhat of a gap in initializing that first conversation; ConnectOnCommute was designed specifically do promote serendipitous interactions with the people to the left and right of us, all across our community.  ', ""ConnectOnCommute acts as an initiator for new, random conversations in real life with different people all around you in your community. Sometimes all we need is an invitation; users turn their 'social mode' on when they want to connect with others. As they're walking around, if another person in social mode is within range, both users receive a 'nudge' that includes the other person's name and a topic of interest to ask them about. Once both people click 'connect', a new connect-record is added to each users personal log.  "", 'The front-end was created with angular, typescript, and bootstrap; the back-end was developed using C#. ConnectOnCommute is hosted on an Azure server. ', ""The initial idea for the app involved using nfc or bluetooth to gage the range for the popup. Without the experience that would typically allow us to develop this kind of feature, we had to get creative with how to track location in a way that was accurate enough and allowed us to set parameters- this involved math... a lot of math... by pulling the gps longitude and latitude coordinates provided by every google chrome browser, we had to use trigonometry, conversion formulas, and advanced algebra to calculate the distance of any two coordinate points, and make it so that only people within 100 meters of each other would appear on each user's screen. It was challenging finding a new and creative way to get beyond this issue, however making it work felt really good when it was done. We also ran into some other minor technical issues, with things such as asynchronous functions/operations, typical bugs, and of course our favorite: syntax errors.

While brainstorming ideas for such problem statements, we agreed there was potential for using natural language processing to analyze frustrations and complaints, using human-centered design principles to light the way. We began designing a way to provide hackathoners and businesses with problem statements so they can focus on what they do best - solving them.Out of this idea came Adroit, an easy-to-use reputation and sentiment analysis tool. We sought a project that would challenge us with skills and frameworks which are new to us, while also keeping human-centered design in focus.

We hypothesized that aggregating complaints from social media and analyzing their similarities could point to services that may need attention, indicating recent major customer concerns with the company.

I dreamed of something more Minority Report—an interface where I could just flick the air in front of me and the model would move. Something like this: Careful, Chief. Dig up the past, all you get is dirty.While things have gotten a lot better (touch screens), I'd still like a lean-back interface where I could contemplate the world while effortlessly spinning my models.And with CAD Viewer, I think I'm halfway (ok, 10%) there.

Three.js & some custom loaders (not written by me) take care of all the shading, mesh generation, and 3D stuff. Dat GUI tho!Color trackingUsing tracking.js, I setup a color tracker that targeted any magenta objects seen by my webcam.

I chose a very calm visual language where each task in the routine is represented by an image that reminds the kids what they need to do.

"NC.js","Machining on the Cloud with StepNC Data and MTConnect Data","[9419, ""When working with StepNC data our team realized that our project could be adapted to use real machining data. MTConnect allows our simultation to be used in much more powerful ways. We envision our project being used in various commercial applications to provide real time monitoring of several machines from one location. Through the use of this software, the efficiency of the manufacturing industry could also be improved by up to or exceeding 15%. The MTConnect data correlates well with STEP-NC data which is our team's main inspiration.  "", 'NC.js is an open source application designed tointerpret StepNC data and create a simulation of thedescribed workplan. NC.js has two options that allowthe user to either drive the simulation from a StepNC fileor instantiate a live viewing instance using a machinethat streams MT-Connect data. NC.js utilizesMTConnect data from a live machine to drive asimulation of the machining tool. Then, throughassociative kinematics, a machine or fixture can beadded to the simulation with correct movement inrelation to the tools. Real time machining informationcan be easily compared to the expected result, allowingmachining mistakes to be caught in process andcorrected, with the eventual goal of mistakes beingcaught before they happen. The current application is also mobile friendly so that livemachining simulations can even be viewed from anywhere by the people who needit most. ', 'The current setup of the simulation is an Okuma OSP-P300 on a LAN with the NC.js server.The Okuma feeds the MTConnect data to the server which then parses and uses it to drive thesimulation. MTConnect’s “PathPosition” tag is used to drive the position of the tool duringruntime, while the GCode block numbers allow us to determine the active working step anddisplay toolpaths relevant to the current operation. We also use MTConnect to determine thefeedrate of the tool. In the future we plan to compare it to the expected feedrate values forerror analysis. The backend uses Node.js and the frontend uses React.js in order to parse the MTConnect and STEP data that is attached to the live server.   ', 'NC.js has many parts that need to work together. Creating it requires learning the STEPNC library, Javascript, and understanding the machining process. If one part of the application breaks it affects every other component, making it hard to pinpoint the exact problem. This behavior requires everyone on the team to have an understanding the entire program in order to effectively add features or fix bugs. Adding an independent view of the geometry seems like an easy task, but required the way geometry is loaded to be refactored entirely. Another issue is that the underlying library is poorly documented and doesn’t always behave as intended. This means that when a problem arises it is difficult to tell if it’s a high-level issue, a low-level issue, or undocumented intended behavior.Accomplishments that we are proud ofSeeing the activity of a machining tool in real time allows for levels of oversight not otherwisepossible. NC.js enables supervision of an operation and confidence that tolerances are beingmet, without needing to be physically present for the machining of a part. Various tools can beused in the simulation in order to see if there will be any problems with a different size tool. Atool of the wrong size can be caught before machining begins by using the simulationenvironment to change what tool is being used on the machine.Because NC.js is designed to be web based it is possible for a part to be monitored anywherein the world. The software could be used in a commercial setting to prove the effectiveness ofnewly developed tools or optimized toolpaths.The largest possible benefit is in the potential automation of machining. Automaticallyensuring tolerances are being met could eliminate the need for human oversight.   Shown above in pink is some of the tolerance highlighting that is being done by NC.js as the Okuma is traversing each GCode operation. Tolerance highlighting will allow for the user tosee which of the current tolerances shown on the sidebar applies to the current workingstep.The end goal is to allow the user to change these tolerances and then save those changes toa new file. These tolerances also allow for error checking throughout the application to makesure that all operations complete correctly.Another benefit is the ability to view the geometry ,at various steps in the workplan, in aseparate pane. This will allow for STEP data to have 3D visualization that is before or after thecurrent working step being machined.The model shown above has annotations displayed throughout the model to show tolerances throughout the piece. The color data is also applied to the piece in order to give the user a better distinction between different parts of the scene. A workplan view is displayed on the sidebar to show the underlying workplan and all of the relevant workingsteps for each of the operations. The nested elements can be expanded to see the hierarchy of the workplan which is useful to machinists.The impeller model shown above has the bounding box of the tool and model highlighted. This box is used for many of the underlying rendering calculations. The impeller model also has some more intricate tolerances highlighted on the blades of the impeller which shows the potential of tolerance association with faces on a 3D model. The tools pane on the sidebar shows which tools are being used in the workplan.  Any tool that is defined within the workplan but isn\'t being used will be lowlighted in order to highlight important aspects to the user.The above shows the list of workingsteps, organized by setup. The simulation will pause in between each setup in order to simulate the need to change the orientation or tool of the machine. The toolpath is displayed and eventually a trace line to show any deviation will also be displayed.What we learnedDuring development we learned a good deal about web design with React components, as well as how to transition our simulation from using a preset path to the tool locations given by MTConnect. By saving state information at higher levels we are able to propogate changes to all components in a timely fashion. This enables all our UI elements to run in sync without losing information between transitions. Understanding how to read the MTConnect data took some time but proved to be a worthwhile time investment. The richness of the data allowed us to easily display all the relevant information. In addition we also were able to get important experience working as a team on a large code base, especially in regards to using Git as a source control tool. What\'s next for NC.jsFuture features will focus on statistical analysis and automatic detection of machining faults.Features that are currently being worked on include:Tracing the path of a toolProviding automatic calculations to determine possible deviations, detecting faultsbefore the entire part is machined incorrectlyComparing material removal to tolerances associated with each part faceThe ability for NC.js to make recommendations for feed rates and spindle speedsbased on optimization algorithmsVisually previewing tolerances, workpieces, and tools while the simulation continues inthe backgroundFurther goals are to allow for tolerances to be added or removed from a model using thesimulation. The end result can then be saved for future use with different tolerances than theoriginal model. We also want to generate recommended changes to the workplan based onthe differences between the simulation and the MTConnect data.

"NEATVIBEwear","NEATVIBEwear is a personal real-time noise exposure monitoring and logging device","[10008, 'Every day we are exposed to harmful levels of noise and don\'t even realize it. Studies show the adverse impact of sustained or prolonged loud noise on our health is not just limited to hearing impairment, but can include increased risk of hypertension, heart disease and stress. Annoyance, sleep disturbance and decreased school performance are also sufficiently attributed to noise exposure (ref: Passchier-Vermeer W, Passchier WF (2000). ""Noise exposure and public health"". Environ. Health Perspect. 108 (Suppl 1): 123–31. doi:10.2307/3454637). Additionally, in occupational settings there are tools that have been developed delineating high-risk noise exposure zones based on point source measurement, but there is a need for a cost effective personal noise exposure capture device used for data collection and visualization in real-time. Deployment of ten or a dozen NEATVIBEwear devices in a single factory/plant production area is more cost effective than procurement of one industrial noise monitoring handheld device. To reliably assess exposure to occupational risk factors it is vital to have estimates of where workers spend their time and how they spend it. The study of Time Activity Patterns (TAP) attempts to answers these questions.  Most time-activity studies for health data collection are written in diaries or entered in on-line surveys, which are inherently biased due to differing degrees of recall and accuracy in reporting (ref: Time Activity Patterns in Exposure Assessment, EUR 15892 Report, EC Directorate on Science., R&D, 1995). Some TAP studies now can be mobile device enabled, but few (if any) record real-time noise exposure coupled with time-activity data. Fitness trackers have similar functionality, but do not include noise exposure.  Collection of accurate, cost-effective real-time TAP and noise exposure would enable factory or plant workers to better protect themselves from risk of hearing loss and other noise-associated harms as studies show work-induced hearing loss is a result of repetitive high noise exposure and workers who are overexposed to noise are at risk for developing hypertension (ref: Assessing High Noise Areas, G.Battista, OH&S, May 2016).The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) within the Center for Disease Control (CDC) has established exposure limits for various decibel (dB) ranges, and yet most people aren\'t aware of their exposure to noise nor exposure at various noise levels.Although there are smart phone apps that can measure dB levels, these apps are limited as they can produce false and/or interrupted readings resulting from phone calls, texts and/or when the app is closed. Additionally, the Smartphone sampling rates may be constrained and battery life can be a concern as well. Finally, if the Smartphone is off it can\'t capture noise level information.Hence, a Noise Exposure, Activity-Time and Vibration Wearable (NEATVIBEwear) device!! What NEATVIBEwear doesNEATVIBEwear is a personal noise capture device integrated to a Smartphone (for the purpose of displaying information) giving users the ability to:View real-time noise exposure at a glanceMonitor and track cumulative noise exposure either on the NIOSH scale or broader ""Health Risk"" scaleSave summary exposure information to log noise cumulative exposure over timeReview and understand available information regarding noise exposureHow we built itNEATVIBEwear is an integration between a personal noise capture device built using an Arduino 101 with the Grove Loudness Sensor (with the potentiometer for adjusting gain and a wide frequency range) and Android Smartphone running the gaming platform Unity as it provides the ability to render a representation of the real-time sound in a 3D color coded simulation.

"Turnstyle","keeping score at every door","[10578, 'As college students, we found that we spent a lot of our time in lines--whether it was the line at the dining hall entrance, in front of the squat rack, or into the big basketball game.  While getting lost in some of these crowds is inevitable, a lot of frustration and waiting could have been avoided if we simply knew how congested these places were before we left our dorm rooms.  If we had a way to monitor everyone on campus, we could figure out when to head to the gym, find the ideal quiet studying spot, and determine when to line up at our favorite campus eatery.Of course monitoring everyone is not feasible--but perhaps we could get close.  We decided that all we needed to do was monitor all of the doors going in and out of each of these places of interest.  This would allow us to compute the population of our favorite places in real time -- and with this, help us plan our days better.  Ideally, we would like to have something to the effect of placing a turnstile near each of these doors.  However, conventional turnstiles are big and bulky, and no one likes having to walk through them everywhere they go.  Was there a way to do this in a less intrusive manner?We had previous experience using ultrasonic sensors and accelerometers in a biomedical devices laboratory in college, and we decided to combine these sensors into a more advanced occupancy sensor device. The Arduino 101 was simply the best device to develop on. The internal inertial motion unit, Bluetooth low-energy communications, I2C bus connectivity, Arduino community, and sensor module libraries all came together to produce a cohesive device for us. ', ""Please refer to our GitHub repo README for all instructions.An Ultrasonic TurnstileOur device is an IoT ultrasonic turnstile that records the number of people in a building or room by detecting when people leave or enter. It uses a combination of sensors that, to our knowledge, has not been used simultaneously in this way.  It allows us to help fight crowding and congestion in a non-invasive way, with no contact or interaction required by the people passing through.  It also detects movement in an anonymous way and preserves the privacy of the people it detects.Live UpdatingOur current build of the device streams population data directly to a mobile application and web application. Within a second of sensing movement in a doorway, it updates those applications and visualizations immediately. The speed at which this data is transferred improves the ability for further development of the device and the services it provides without appreciably reducing the speed at which it can deliver those services.  Furthermore, the Turnstyle can be used as a security feature if the door is unexpectedly opened -- perhaps outside of business hours.  Turnstyle seeks to serve both building managers -- in the form of a mobile application they can use to manage and monitor their Turnstyle --  and the general public -- with a widely available web application --  by providing both with valuable real time data.Powerful AnalyticsTurnstyle provides live population monitoring, helping people make educated decisions about where to head in the current moment.  It also provides aggregate measurements such as most popular times and general traffic trends to give people a general sense of how crowded places will be in the future.  We hope that the analytics that Turnstyle has to offer will help us better plan as a society and allow us to lead more efficient lives.  Just as people check the weather each morning, checking Turnstyle's data will encourage people to head to work at less busy times or eat at their favorite restaurants during slow hours -- saving us all from the pain of traffic jams, stalled roads, and wasted time.   "", ""Turnstyle UnitA magnetic contact switch is used in conjunction with the Arduino 101’s internal motion sensing to determine when the door opens.The precise angle that the door makes with the wall is computed using the Madgwick Filter.  When the door is opened beyond a threshold angle, the ultrasonic sensors on each side of the door start firing.  Depending on which sensor detects motion first, the directionality of people travelling through can be determined.The Arduino 101's internal BLE capabilities communicate with the mobile application.The Serial output of the Turnstyle is sent into a Node.js server to plot the results in real time.Any of these variables-- the threshold angle, the distance at which the ultrasonic sensors maximally operate, the directionality of traffic, can all be tuned to match the specific needs of each door. Real Time PlottingA Node.js server uses streams and plotly's streaming API to generate the plots in real time.  It parses the population data from Turnstyle's serial output and creates the plots on the fly.Mobile ApplicationOur mobile application is built using Evothings, a platform designed for creating IoT applications.  Evothings allowed us to write applications that could be run on Android, iOS, and Windows Phone in pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript.  We used Evothings's BLE libraries to allow the application to send and receive messages with the Arduino. "", 'We built an entire functional Android application on Android Studio, but it would only work for android 5.0 because of Bluetooth permission issues associated with 6.0+, so we had to scrap it and learn how to use Evothings in the span of two daysWe hit the API stream limit multiple times (at least 5) on plot.lyTwelve-hour time zone difference caused difficulties in testing and collaborating - two of us were in a different country for an entire month.Lots of difficulties getting Bluetooth to communicate in real time; we had no experience with it and had to learn a lot from the limited documentation. ', 'Using many features of the Intel Arduino 101 in our hack, including the built-in accelerometer, gyroscope, and Bluetooth modules.  We really felt like we were getting the most out of the hardware.Providing both an application and a web service for real time tracking and analyzing data - seeing how quickly our phones and computers responded to the Turnstyle was insanely satisfying.Inertial motion units are accurate within several minutes from baseline but have a strong tendency to “drift,” causing the device’s reported motion to be much different from its actual motion. This is troublesome in the case of tracking an object over a long period of time, but we were able to cleverly navigate around this by using the magnetic contact switch to notify when a baseline position in space was met. That way, “drift” over time doesn’t affect the device’s measurement of the door’s motion as we reset the drift to 0 each time the door is closed.Finishing without drinking any coffee ', 'Bluetooth is a lot more complicated than we initially gave it credit for -- we had to learn a lot about subscription models and UUIDs and the like.  It was also extremely difficult to debug, and the most unexplainable issues are often best solved by resetting the Bluetooth on the phone.Different versions of Android have different problems with Bluetooth -- we need to be more considerate of different versions of the same platform when developing future projects.All of Evothings and Plot.ly!  This was a great first experience with IoT, and we were surprised to see so many tools and technologies specifically designed for IoT projects.Each of us also became better hackers in general; other than Arduino, there was not a single technology we used for this project that all of us have used before! ', ""The biggest feature we have yet to implement is support for multiple simultaneous Turnstyles.  Since most large places have multiple doors, this is a very important feature.  Right now, we could probably implement support for a couple devices at a time (using BLE communication protocols and streaming Node servers), but support for extremely large public spaces (think museums and monuments) would require engineering for scalability.Building applications for specific use cases. For example, a building manager could have a monitor that tells them when to call in maintenance after a certain number of people have used the building, a more reliable metric for needing repairs as opposed to a regular time interval. Another example would be having a live update on specific websites of the number of people at a particular library, post office, or grocery store, so consumers can avoid long times and plan accordingly. A better detection procedure would be helpful; although the population counting is quick robust and accurate, it can be fooled, especially if someone is trying to intentionally deceive the detector.  A possible (but complicated) solution would be to use computer vision to identify faces, but this would defeat part of Turnstyle's purpose -- to be relatively cheap, mass-producible, and non-intrusive.  We would like to look into finding a happy medium between sensor overkill and cost.Creating alternate Turnstyles to accommodate different doors, such as sliding doors, revolving doors, or two-way doors.  You would be surprised by how many different kinds of doors are out there.

"Farmed","Harness the power of data to feed the world","[9425, 'One of our colleagues grew up on a farm in Iowa.  We wanted to see if we could mash up the USDA datasets to help existing farmers become more productive. As we undertook this challenge, we kept a few design principles in mind: keep the data local and relevant to farmers, and layer interesting data on maps to draw insightful conclusions. ', 'Our application maps your land and growth density data to identify problem spots and see how well your neighbors have taken care of their land, because you might be looking to expand your acreage. The rainfall and crop yield graphs reveal which crops performed the best in challenging precipitation years so that you can plan for dry years. ', 'We started with farmer interviews and data exploration.  We tried to see what questions actual farmers are asking that we could answer from the data provided by the USDA.  The number one issue that all of the farmers mentioned was water.  We decided to combine the USDA data with a dataset from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that contains precipitation and temperature data. Architecturally the application is built using using Javascript, Node.js, React.js, Dc.js, and the google-map API.  We use a combination of Bower, Node.js, and Gulp to test package and deploy the application.  We tried to keep the entire application client side to simplify testing and development.  We used github.com to host the source code during development.  The project is public for anyone who would like to look under the covers.Challenges We ran intoConstrained DataWe were constrained by the limited data in the datasets. For example, yield data was only available from the surveys that occur every five years. The activities data was not available in the granularity that we wanted and it is in the form of percentage of land on which each activity was performed over a year, rather than area-specific data about where herbicide was applied to specific plots of land.TimeGiven more time, we would have been able to implement visual details we had built into the planned experience using hi-fidelity wireframes that added an element of fun and polish, such as using a raindrop and leaf for the rainfall and yield graph.We would like to explore more external datasets and pull data out of them to make meaningful connections.  We would like to compare the temperature data from the existing NOAA dataset to yield data in the application.Behavior ChangeIn terms of behavior, farmers don’t have the time to create or maintain online presence, so despite what we learned about the need to share experiences more efficiently in a more targeted manner online, we would have had to tread carefully with such a solution. Additionally, many farmers initially decided to farm in order to get away from the computer. Therefore, any technological application we build has to distill the data into digestible and actionable chunks that require minimal time to analyze. Where possible, we analyze for the farmer and point out information of interest.ScopeSome of our most compelling ideas were out of scope for this project because they would have required us to use machine learning techniques to identify and recognize patterns from existing data and make recommendations for useful courses of action for the farmers. Other ideas, such as creating a social platform, would require building an active user base overnight.Accomplishments that we\'re proud ofWe reached a wide spectrum of farmers and began to really understand their workflow, motivations, and challenges.We addressed both the hackathon’s challenge and farmers’ needs:An important part of sustainability is keeping food production and distribution local. Our map-based application appeals to farmers by showing them exactly what is happening on their land and in the surrounding local community. The Farmed application helps them understand their land holistically, using history as a teaching tool, so that they can make decisions that support increased productivity.Weather is the number one challenge cited by farmers. Our application arms them with historical weather data that they can use to plan crops for projected drought years. It is flexible enough for us to add real time weather predictions for short-term planning as part of future work.The Farmed application focuses on a specific type of farmer and is designed with him in mind. We ensure that the farmer’s interaction with our application will be enjoyable and to the point.What we learnedAn Aging PopulationCurrent farmers are aging out, resulting in a loss of knowledge. The US may soon see a lack of people growing healthy food close to home. The US is losing farms at an alarming pace, and the majority of farm subsidies go to animal feed and sugar, not healthy food for people.Sharing ExperienceFarmers, especially the young ones who are just starting out, cannot easily support or learn from each other, but it’s important to them to be able to share information, new approaches, and advice on how to respond to different challenges. They need to make decisions such as when to plant and harvest, what crops grow well in their area, what works with regards to soil type and weather patterns, and how to deal with adverse conditions. Farmers primarily plan their crops by spending time researching online or they get advice by talking to other farmers at farmers markets. They would like to receive information in the moment, but people are busy, and finding the right person to talk to is all about being at the right place at the right time. One way to facilitate sharing would be to combine farm journals and weather data across people and locations. Finger to the WindWe are trying to quantify things people aren’t used to quantifying. These things usually go by gut feeling, such as gauging soil moisture. Everything is in the farmer’s head, and they make decisions based on their experience. Farmers learn from their mistakes by reviewing their farm journals. There is an opportunity to help farmers focus attention during critical times with alerts that then lead to recommended responses. We would like to add recommendations to the Farmed application in the future.SustainabilitySustainability, like the term ‘organic’, means different things to different people. To many farmers, sustainability means taking care of the land, growing the soil, and managing the farm in such a way that the farm is a closed system that sustains itself. To some, sustainability is about being able to feed the nation in an accountable way for many generations to come. To others, sustainability is about feeding the local community and maintaining a balanced personal lifestyle.What\'s next for ATS / EchoUser USDAAdd soil survey data over the vegetation density data.Add temperature data over the rainfall and yield data.Train the application to suggest varieties to grow and activities to perform based on past performance in certain conditions (e. g. what sort of nutrient level adjustments need to be made for certain soil types).Help farmers focus attention during critical times with alerts that then lead to recommended responses.Connect farmers to each other to share their experiences dealing with infestations and the weather.Connect farmers to arrange transportation to markets, and coordinate truck routes and deliveries, in order to reduce the environmental impact.A Walk Through FarmedBegin typing \'West Milford Road, Milford, NE, United States\' into the search box above the map.

Our map-based application appeals to farmers by showing them exactly what is happening on their land and in the surrounding local community. The Farmed application helps them understand their land holistically, using history as a teaching tool, so that they can make decisions that support increased productivity.Weather is the number one challenge cited by farmers. Our application arms them with historical weather data that they can use to plan crops for projected drought years. It is flexible enough for us to add real time weather predictions for short-term planning as part of future work.The Farmed application focuses on a specific type of farmer and is designed with him in mind. We ensure that the farmer’s interaction with our application will be enjoyable and to the point. ', 'An Aging PopulationCurrent farmers are aging out, resulting in a loss of knowledge. The US may soon see a lack of people growing healthy food close to home. The US is losing farms at an alarming pace, and the majority of farm subsidies go to animal feed and sugar, not healthy food for people.Sharing ExperienceFarmers, especially the young ones who are just starting out, cannot easily support or learn from each other, but it’s important to them to be able to share information, new approaches, and advice on how to respond to different challenges. They need to make decisions such as when to plant and harvest, what crops grow well in their area, what works with regards to soil type and weather patterns, and how to deal with adverse conditions. Farmers primarily plan their crops by spending time researching online or they get advice by talking to other farmers at farmers markets. They would like to receive information in the moment, but people are busy, and finding the right person to talk to is all about being at the right place at the right time. One way to facilitate sharing would be to combine farm journals and weather data across people and locations. Finger to the WindWe are trying to quantify things people aren’t used to quantifying. These things usually go by gut feeling, such as gauging soil moisture. Everything is in the farmer’s head, and they make decisions based on their experience. Farmers learn from their mistakes by reviewing their farm journals. There is an opportunity to help farmers focus attention during critical times with alerts that then lead to recommended responses. We would like to add recommendations to the Farmed application in the future.SustainabilitySustainability, like the term ‘organic’, means different things to different people. To many farmers, sustainability means taking care of the land, growing the soil, and managing the farm in such a way that the farm is a closed system that sustains itself. To some, sustainability is about being able to feed the nation in an accountable way for many generations to come. To others, sustainability is about feeding the local community and maintaining a balanced personal lifestyle.

When I switch BaseShield working voltage to 5, problems start. Although these sensors can work with 5V but I solved with trying and anlaysing. I also had a problem with connecting water sensor to Arduino 101 with LCD because LCD sticks when sensor is connected. So I used another Arduino. At last I think this is a problem for water sensor.

The C++ application then used this coordinate data to make decisions on the speed of both the motors, which was then sent to an Arduino over serial.  The Arduino maps this commanded speed to a usable duty cycle and sends a PWM signal to the motor controllers. ', 'Most of the challenges encountered with the project involved communicating between the computer and Arduino.  We needed to communicate over serial to the Arduino through the C++ application, and we managed to find a third party library that allowed us to send the serial data we needed.  We then had to format the data so we could 1) update the motors quickly and 2) make sure we had accurate data on the receiving end to ensure the Arduino interprets the computers commands correctly. In terms of hardware, we had no idea if the motors would even move the cart because in order to get cheap motors, you have to settle for no specifications about what you’re buying.  Thankfully that worked, and the motor controllers held up.  The Kinect has a proprietary connector that splits into data for to the computer over USB, and power to a 12V wall adapter.  We wound up taking our base 24V battery power, stepping it down to 12V through a buck converter, feeding that into a 12V car inverter that inverts it up to 110V AC, at which point the wall adapter rectifies and steps it down to 12V DC.The Kinect API also took some time to figure out, but eventually we were able to get data from it very consistently.

"AR Voice ML Ninjutsu Battle Simulator ","Our project bridge the gap between science fiction and reality, bring anime characters to life. Users get to reenact their favourite scenes and justus from the anime Naruto with their anime figures!! ","[5174, 'Simply put, our project bridge the gap between science fiction and reality. We are a group of anime fans who dreamed of anime characters coming to real life since our childhood. In the past 3 days, we made our dreams come true. Our AR battle simulator projects hologram on our favourite anime characters to bring them to life. We achieved two main goals: projecting hologram to bring our anime protagonist to live; casting Japanese ninjutsu in hologram form through ML Hand Sign Recognition. These used to be only items that exists in anime classics such as Naruto (an anime about Japanese Ninjas) , Yugioh (an anime about a card game that can summon virtual/real monsters), but today we brought them from the 2D display to the 3D world.  A small step for 4 anime fans, a giant leap for the anime community. In addition, the anime industry is a huge untapped market in the west. According to Hollywoodreport, the revenue of the anime industry in 2017 was 19.1 billion USD. The industry is full of figure collectors that are more than willing to pay for innovative anime merchandise. Not only is our project a major breakthrough for the anime community, it is also potentially extremely profitable.  ', ""The battle simulator is a game where two players brawl off in the battle of Naruto ninjutsu hand signs. Each player has an anime figure. When ninjutsu is cast, the effect is projected on the anime figure as a hologram. The machine learning model can identify 12 unique hang signs from the anime Naruto and different anime cards. Each ninjutsu consists of multiple hand signs.

We build the machine learning model using Keras and tensorflow. We trained the model with custom dataset with 15k images gathered during the hackathon (it took a long time). At the same time, we also worked on creating a front and backend connection to host the animations and hold the game logic. We utilized flask for the backend and used react for the frontend.Challenges WE ran intoWith flask being single threaded (python in general) it was difficult for us to maintain or plan for multiple thread usages, something node would do great. However, tensorflow and keras has such a great python community that we chose to stick with it. Accomplishments that WE are proud ofWe set out a grand vision at the beginning of Hack the North to build a hologram AI battle dome. The objective was difficult and grand in nature; however, we were able to achieve it in the end. It is more than a minimum viable product, it represents the hard work and the constant trial and error during the 36 hours of Hack the North. What WE learnedWe learned to decrease the scope of the project when time and resource constraints are major issues. Machine learning, text to speech, web development, and hologram. Needless to say, we were ambitious. It is as if we are building 4 projects side by side instead of one. We learned that to achieve this grand vision, we had to decrease the scope of the project and use helpful APIs to do different components. We decreased the number of consecutive hand signs from 5 to 2; we used an API called Voice Flow to build the voice controller instead of building it from scratch. All of these discussions helped us to achieve our end goal.   What's next for AR Voice Control and ML Hand Sign Ninjutsu Battle SimulatorThe next step for the AR Voice Control and ML Hand Sign Ninjutsu Battle Simulator is to build a version of it that works for a smartphone. We already prototyped the hardware for the hologram display, all that is left is an innovative idea for the software components.

I'm a Third Year CSE student and always loved to explore and experiment with the technology around me. Voice is the next big thing in the industry with over Millions of AI enabled voice assistant devices already in the market. This is my first skill using APL and I hope it results out good. Didn't have much time to develop as my academic work was also there, but still I'm happy with my end results. Inspiration for this skill came to me from daily foodie desires. I always ask my mom to cook me something new everyday, but we can't decide what to make half of the time. "", 'So I tried to make a skill which provides me a random recipe made using ingredient which I ask. I have also included a feature in which it will just give out a lucky & trendy recipe name which we can try.It uses an external API to fetch the names of the recipes and related information and then I relay it out to my users using Alexa.You can ask it to give recipes made using cake etc.I plan to include step by step instructions along with visuals in future updates of this skill.

I live in India, so I'll try to bring regional dishes also to the skill. Also instead of an external API, I'm planning to build up my own AI model which can generate new recipes from available ingredients ( It would be a very nice experimental feature) Also Planning to provide step by step visual instructions to follow the recipe in the near future.Thank you!

"Beat The Opponent","Beat your opponents or learn from them, both way you win.","[5027, 'Amazon Alexa being a voice first interaction device/platform, and a session based (speak/listen/reply) kind of usage pattern, there are limited things you can do with it when it comes to kids. It boils down to a ""ask question, expect answer"" kind of a platform. As a developer/designer, we would innovate in how we ask the question or how we make the kids feel (using a storyline), as that is under our control . This was my thinking process while thinking of an idea for this hackathon. A very obvious choice came to mind, A QUIZ. No surprises there. But the number of trivial quiz skills in the Alexa skills store is overwhelming. A very simple guess for the low ratings of such skills is that it does not innovate in the ""ask question, expect answer"" pattern. It just blindly follows it.I thought about many other skills, and all required the use of echo show to make it \'actually\' fun to use or play. What I ended up with is  :A skill that would not ask:Only Geeky questions (boring for one and fun for the other)Only Math questions (enhance calculation skills)Only Game Of Thrones questions (make it fun for the start and boring after some time)...etc. (I think you got the point there)Moreover, I wanted to add a human touch to it so that the kids not only interact with Alexa but many others like Alexa. For example, if I am playing with an opponent (not a real one), I would not like Alexa to just tell me that this is your opponent, you will be competing with it. I would want the opponent to talk to me in some way so that I don\'t get bored with random opponent names. ', ""The skills name is 'Beat the Opponent' (Sorry for the boring name there). It is an interactive quiz game for the kids which has multiple levels and different opponent for each level. The themes are different for each level. For example, the first level's theme is on Superheroes where you will be playing against an opponent named Rick. Rick will introduce himself to you (not in Alexas voice but his own). And there will be a connection between Rick's introduction and the level's theme. So as one might expect, Rick is a superheroes fanatic, he likes to watch Marvel/DC/etc. Every level has 10 questions, and the skill keeps a count of your score (right vs wrong). At the end of the level (10 questions), it will compare your score with Ricks and tell you whether you won or not. If not, Rematch!, or Proceed to next level! Another example of a theme is 'audio-based'. In the 3rd level, you will be presented with sounds of a turkey, campfire, beating eggs, a man speaking Chinese and other cool things, for the kid to identify and pick. See I told you, not so boring after all.I don't want kids to take it as a quiz (because if they are even 1% like I was as a kid, they would hate that word, though they might have fun playing it.). Also, You would not hear a kid say to others on the playground about how a quiz is badass. THE BEST THING?Please try it on echo show and you will know it.

One can listen to music or watch videos with their family members, even when not together and still share the love.

"Baby SmartGate","A smart baby gate that alerts you when you accidently leave it open!","[5316, 'We have an 8 month old daughter who just started to crawl so I installed a baby gate at the top of our stairs to prevent falls.  The problem is, making sure it\'s always properly closed can be difficult, especially for new parents like us.  You can forget to close it because you are in a hurry or not bother closing it because ""I\'ll just be gone for a second"".  And sometimes you think you closed it but it didn\'t latch properly.  I designed the Baby SmartGate to solve these issues and increase the safety of our home! ', 'The Baby SmartGate uses a reed switch to detect if the gate is opened or closed.  Once the gate has been opened it turns on a red LED and starts a timer.  If the gate hasn\'t been closed in the allotted time (in this case, 10 seconds) it starts a procedure to alert those nearby.  For 8 seconds it starts beeping and increases the LED brightness.  Then for another 8 seconds it further increases the LED brightness and beeping intensity.  Finally the LED starts flashing and the buzzer is at full blast.  Hopefully an adult will notice and close the gate!When the gate is closed it briefly turns on a green LED to let the parent know it is secure and then goes back to sleep.The idea is that the alerting will help ""train"" the parents to always close the gate and make it a habit.  Without an alert it would be easier to become lazy with the gate, which is often what results in accidents. ', ""The design was fairly simple.  I opened up the latching parts of the gate and found that a cylindrical reed switch fit perfectly into both sides.  The magnet part of the switch fits in the swinging gate and thus doesn't require a power source.  The other side of the switch connects to the Arduino 101 which has a rising edge interrupt setup on the pin.  I also connected an RGB LED and active buzzer for visual and auditory alerts and a button to allow me to mute the buzzer if I need the gate opened for an extended period of time.When the reed switch is closed I put the Arduino 101 (Curie) into a sleep state to conserve power.  When the switch is opened it fires the interrupt which starts my state machine to go through the various alert levels.  I also used the CurieTimerOne to create an interrupt driven PWM on the buzzer pin to simplify my beeping routines. "", 'There weren\'t many challenges with the core design but I did run into issues when trying to improve it.  First the library I used for the Curie sleep and interrupts is not ""official"" yet and has some issues.  I wanted to use PM.sleep(x) durations for my alert level timers to conserve more power but they were causing weird behavior.  Also, to eliminate the need for constantly checking the state of the switch in the state machine I tried to use normal interrupts but was having issues with detaching and reattaching the Curie sleep interrupts.I also experimented with adding the CurieBLE library to send a message to the user\'s phone when the gate was opened but the connection would always get lost when I put the Curie to sleep even though the Curie datasheet says BLE should be able to operate when the SoC is sleeping.  The firmware for Curie seems to still be in development in this area so I dropped this idea as I wanted this to be a battery powered device and needed the sleep state to work. ', ""Mainly I'm just happy that this project helped improve the safety of my home for my newborn daughter.  A recent study showed that every 5 minutes a child in the US falls down the stairs and is sent to the emergency room*.  If something like this could help prevent just one child from falling down the stairs it would be worth the incremental cost to existing baby gates. "", ""I hadn't used interrupts or state machines before in Arduino code so that was a good learning experience.  Also, I'm happy to have learned just how low Curie's power consumption is while in sleep which gives me ideas for a number of future battery driven projects. "", ""I need to do power calculations to see how long it could last on a battery as it would not be feasible to have this plugged in.  Also, I would need to find a Curie board with a smaller footprint than the Arduino 101 so I can mount it easier, preferably inside the existing gate, or the whole thing should be put in some type of enclosure for safety and aesthetics.  I'd also like to get the BLE working with the sleep states and find a cheap BLE gateway it could communicate with to connect to the internet and send text messages when the gate has been opened for too long.I'd also like to look into a simplified version of this using just a 555 CMOS timer.

Both from the designer’s point of view and the one servicing them, it is an excellent idea to be aware. The mission is to reduce the problems faced by the drivers because of air loss in tyres. IoTyre is an Air Pressure Monitoring system which has a sensor that is installed in the vehicle near its tyre and monitors the tyre pressure. If a pressure loss occurs in one or more tyres, the system automatically shows this as a warning in the Iotyre Dashboard. Since an incorrect tyre pressure increases the braking distance, can impair cornering and can cause tyres to heat up, this automatic monitoring is intended to increase driving safety and prevent accidents. The driver also no longer needs to perform manual air pressure checks and is informed immediately about any tyre pressure problems.   ', 'Once the user installs the sensors near the tyre of his vehicle he has to monitor the air pressure through the IoTyre  application. The sensors will check the pressure using distance formula and give the user the percentage of air pressure there in tyres.  It will compare the baseline value of the pressure which is calculated initially when the air is filled into the tyre. Then the user will get the current air pressure in the tyre in the application and if the air pressure is less than cut off value i.e. it’s too low then the user gets the SMS notification through the application that the tyre are not in the good condition and need to fill with air. After every hour sensor will send data to Amazon IOT through MTQQ protocol automatically and update the values of the air pressure in the application so that the user gets the latest air pressure of his vehicle tyre.

"SMS Chat Messenger","An app that allows Sending and Sharing of Sms Text Messages and Media Files powered by Whispir.Io","[6362, ""When I interview some Business companies that  uses SMS as their main ways of communicating their business endavour to their clients,customers etc. The response I got was that SMS could have been the best optionagainst Email Messages, if there is a way to Store, Warehouse  SMS Text Messages and Multi-Media Filesalready sent to their Customers devices,desktop applications for future retrival,Editing,Resending and for other purposes. Proffessor Mike Filler in my school who owns a Shopping Mall also Point out that SMS text Messages seems to be a use and throw away data and thus does not store data unlike Email while some Business specialist in my vicinity  who owns Butticks, Large Supermarkets, Agriculturist etc complainsthat their customer services recieve thousands of SMS text Messages in a day and that scrolling of the phones in search of SMS,sorting of the sms text Messages and Media Files in order to be able to respond back to their customers is time consuming andsometime absolutely impossible in a high traffic SMS reception environments.Dr & Mrs. Richard Moore who owns a construction Company where I did my Industrial Training as a IT. Scientist points out that itstrue that SMS is faster than Email in terms of real time messaging but they still need to have all their SMS Messages storedsomewhere in the could as a data where they can get it anytime anyday. He also points out that the SMS Messages should be senton 1-to-1 basis(ie Peer to Peer sms text messagings) with caging process that prevent for instance  prevents User C fromhaving access to conversation that exist between UserA and User B.My Dad points out that if an SMS app could be built to meet up all the functions above,it will make the app most suitable in Ticket System because since sms is a realtime messaging protocols and the app also provides one to one SMS Chatcommunications, it will make tracking of Messages,complains, issues etc on Tickets System very easy on each Users(Customers)Uniquely.What I  Learnt from Inspiration and Interview aboveI have seen reason why many companies are using Emails as means of communication with their customers and Clients as oppossedto using SMS which provides faster realtime messages. I also learnt that:A.) Every Company, School, Organisation needs their SMS Data/information to be stored somewhere in the cloud whereit can easily  be retrieved,edit, further process or even resend. 2.) I learnt there is a need for communication contuniuty especially in Tickets System where a Customer ask or sent a complain and the issue has to be tackled my sending a follow up messages in real time.3.) I also learnt that a company can have more than 1 million customers and there is a need to have to 1-to-1 message exchange which only SMS peer to peer technology can provide.4.) Many More ......What is on my mindSMS Chat Messenger is a messaging service built on sms technology Powered by Whispir.IoThe More I looked at Whispir.Io technology, the more I think of Whispir SMS not only as way of sending just text messagesand Media files to users devices but also as a database for data storage(Eg. For Schools, Companies, Transportaions, E-commerce etc.).Thinking of it as an SMS Chat messenger. I apply the ease of mobile messengers to Whispir SMS's protocol,thereby creating a universal communication platform available to anyone with an mobile number. (as opposed to Whatsapp/FB Messenger closed networks)What I builtAn app that allows Sending,Re-sending,Tracking and Sharing of sms text messages, Multi-Media files eg Photos via Peer to peer(1-to-1) sms ProtocolsEg. between one user and another, between a company and its clients etc.How to use the app1.) Create one time registration using your mobile contact and then login.2.) Sending and Sharing of SMS Text Messages and Media Files can be accomplished in 3 ways stated below:A.) Search the user you want to sms to from the search box using her mobile number or names. once the user is populated,click on the user and navigate to the users profile to start sending sms via 1-to-1 sms chat protocol.B.) You can also send SMS by clicking on Add People Button, select the User you are looking for and start sending smsC.) You can also send SMS from your friend list.To do this you can either search the user from the search box via mobile no, names etc or click on Add People to send friend request to that user, when the user acceppts your request, He or she automatically appears in Friend list and from there you can start sending SMS and Multi-Media Files.click on Load More Button if you need to load more friends..3.)SMS Alert Components keeps track of SMS Notifications that were sent to your devices. You can reply sms messages sentto you using this option.4.) SMS History: Keeps timely Tracks of all the SMS text Messages and Files you sent to your friends, customers etc. It provides with option to edit, resend and delete already sent SMS text Messages and Files.What happen when you sent a File(Eg. Photo) to Recipients via the app.The files get sent via the SMS Chat System immediately so that the recipient can see it if he or she is online. But because its an uploaded file not just a text message, whispir does not currentlyhave a way of sending the files directly to recipient devices. So what the app do is to send the files full link to the Recipient devices via WhispirSMS. The recipient can then download the file by typing the link on a browser or by clicking on adownload button withinthe app (SMS Chat Messaging System).Integration:The App can easily be integrated into social network, businesses, Transportations, Agriculture,Schools, E-commerce, Tickets System etc.ChallengesBuilding a Peer to Peer(1 to 1) SMS Chat Technology is very hard to accomplish. combining Files Sharing with text messagesis hard as well. Online and offline presence of each user is also hard to accomplishAbout Whispir TechnologyI have tested both Whispir Voice, Email and SMS API and found out they are easy to integrate and awesome.Their Engineers are professionals who knows their job.Built Withwhispir-smsTry it outfredcare.com      Submitted to    Whispir: Make Your App Talk    Created by  deleted deleted "", ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['whispir-sms']","False","11","","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/309/746/datas/small.png","True","8"

"Artisell - Indian culture revisited","INSANELY INTUITIVE two-way marketplace for buying and selling of handicrafts &amp; goods. Artisan Awareness is the aim.","[7873, ""On the highway from Maharashtra to Gujarat, I met a lot of Artisans selling their clay pots and various other crafts on the Roadside of the National highway.The quality of their goods were very high and they were beautifully made but astonishingly they were selling at negligible rates! The reason is - they have the skill but not the means to showcase it well enough.India has a very diverse and unique handicrafts culture that is slowly fading away due to 2 reasonsLack of discoverability for artisans (to sell their products)Lack of consumer awareness (People just don't know about the beauty these artisans create!)We aim to solve this issue through our 2 sided marketplace and artisan awareness app - Artisell.Note: You may argue that there are a ton of eCommerce players trying to tap into the Rural Artisan community and sell their products online. But all of the apps (Flipkart, Myntra, Snapdeal, Limeroad) have horrible experience and expect that you are an expert in English, and the flow of mobile apps and various methodologies. Just go to Google Play and see the screenshots for any of the seller apps. They are the most difficult to use apps out there - as they ask 100s of things before you can really upload a product. Our apps primary aim is to make every single artisan be able to use the product from the get-go and requires little to no training in use of content systems. Also, the unique image and tag based search algorithms make it easy for buyers to search for products without having to know any unique SKUs. "", ""'Artisell' aims to be a 2 way marketplace for buying and selling of goods made by rural artisans - handicrafts, clothing, traditional footwear, paintings, clay pots, etc. Artisans can directly sell their products and buyers can buy directly and post custom job requests for artisans.Simply, there are 2 apps involved in Artisell. The seller app and the buyer app.The seller app is meant for Artisans, and has a UNIQUE, SIMPLE, and INTUITIVE user experience catered to users who are laymen and have little or no knowledge of using smartphones. The USP of the seller app is that in just a few simple steps and careful guidance (through voice, imagery and animations), the Artisan can operate the app with little to no traning. Apart from this, the seller app has following features (All built with usability in mind)1. Add product (4 steps -> Select category, Type or Say product name, Upload image, and Add Price)    - Here automatically our system generates tags based on the image uploaded    - For every step there is visual cues and the artisan can press a button to HEAR a voice clip explaining what to do    - Incase there is no internet the product is stored offline and sent to server later2. Accept Job offers    - Any user/buyer can push job requests through the seller app. These can be viewed, reviewed and accepted by artisans3. View nearby Artisans    - The Artisan can view any nearby artisans in a list and map view - and one tap call them for any sort of query or discussion they might want to have    - Artisan can view his own profile as well4. View Events/Melas/Fairs    - Artisans generally look to attend various fairs and events to sell their goods. A lot of Artisans miss out of the opportunity due to lack of information.     - Both a list and a map view5. View products    - Grid view of Artisans products    - Can be tapped to see detailed view of the products6. Switch languages    - With one tap the whole app can be toggled between HINDI and ENGLISH!The buyer app on the other hand, is also a unique and simple buying experience for customers (primarily wholesalers) to buy products directly from the artisans.Features include1. Search Product by IMAGE    - Upload an image and similar products will be displayed by our app2. Search Product by KEYWORD3. Search Product using Filters - Price, Quantity, etc.4. Create a Job Request    - Buyers can create job request which contains some sort of task they would want the artisan to complete    - Buyer sets the budget, approximate delivery date, description and OPTIONAL image to support the display    - On approval of any job request by any artisan - the buyer will be notified with the details of the artisan5.

The user is given 2 choices in the chrome extension: apply an Adversarial Patch to his/her image or evenly distribute Adversarial Noise across the image. For the Adversarial Patch, the extension adds a patch on the image provided that causes a general object recognition classifier to misclassify an image.[2] The patch is made by applying expectation over transformation, over a random area of the image. For the Adversarial Noise, the extension makes quasi-imperceptible changes to the image such that a machine learning model classifies it incorrectly by using a single gradient ascent step, also know as a ""fast gradient sign method"".[3] While both approaches typically require a known existing neural network architecture to compute their adversarial attacks, a.k.a. a white box attack, they have been shown to work well on black box neural network architectures as well.[3] Text input is converted into an image before applying the Adversarial Attack.

Blocker performs less effectively against some adversarial defenses, e.g. Robust Optimization and Certificates.[4] To overcome this, we can apply 2nd-order gradient information in our future work to generate better-performing adversaries against these defenses. One feature that we did not manage to fully implement was a Universal Adversarial Attack to pre-compute and transform the images in a O(1) constant-time operation for the adversarial step.[1] However, this comes at the expense of less robust A.I. Blocker. Other than improvements to the Adversarial Noise approach, there is also room for improvement for the Adversarial Patch approach. One such improvement can be the use of clever geometry to blend the patch into the image more seamlessly, such as an Adversarial Frame around text.

How many of those people automatically check Airbnb as their default without ever comparing hotels nearby? While many people assume Airbnb has the lowest accommodation prices, in many places hotels are actually cheaper and/or provide a better experience than renting an Airbnb. We\'re deal hunters at our core and we wanted to make travel planning easy by enabling multiple sources of travel data in one place to get the best deals and experiences with the least amount of effort while planning the perfect dream vacation or that recurring work related trip. Enter Air Compare - the one stop shop travel planning Chrome extension that allows users to:• Compare hotels near the Airbnb listing they\'re considering • Get average car rental prices based on when you’re renting a car• Get estimated ride sharing (Lyft) prices to their destinationsWe wanted to provide users with the best accommodation deals but more importantly, we also wanted to solve the ""last mile problem"" (getting people from a transportation hub to their final destination) as it relates to travel. Often transportation costs end up adding up significantly and it’s difficult when planning a trip to estimate those costs ahead of time. We wanted to bring transparency to this area so there’s no hidden surprises when it comes time to travel, only #unforgettableexperiences. ', ""We've built a seamless, multi-faceted Chrome extension that gives users peace of mind that they're getting the best deals while saving them countless hours of searching multiple different sites and apps (because each hour saved is another hour to watch funny cat videos #priorities).  At its very basic function, Air Compare will automatically populate hotels within an Airbnb's vicinity and in a similar price range (+/- $50) and users can filter by distance and price. Users can also review each hotel's amenities so they can make the best choice based on what's important to them when travelling, with a point of comparison against what Airbnbs offer.For those more sophisticated travelers who like to plan in advance (my Virgo perfectionists, I'm talking to you!) and know their itinerary, they can go to Add Trip Details to enter in a destination address (such as their client's office or a tourist destination they'll be visiting) and also search for car rental and ride sharing prices to/from their destination.Air Compare allows users to:Compare multiple hotels near the Airbnb listing they're considering with information on:Distance from the hotel to the Airbnb with the ability to sort by distance or pricePrice per night Hotel amenities (users can compare the Airbnb amenities with hotel amenities to determine what's truly important to their trip; a hot tub time machine may be crucial when scaling Mount Everest but not so crucial on a Safari adventure in Africa)Filter and sort by rewards points and/or price for programs like the Starwoods Preferred Guest loyalty program without having to check yet another siteDetermine whether renting a car or using ride sharing is the better choice:Get average car rental prices (based on the nearest airport the Airbnb is closest to)Get Lyft estimates from the airport to the Airbnb AND each nearby hotelGet Lyft estimates and travel times to a destination for both the Airbnb listing AND each nearby hotel (because we're overachievers like that!)Users can now compare at a glance how much their car rental vs. using ride sharing will cost without guessing or doing any extra work  "", 'DataGridJavalinOpenJDKKotlinNode (Scraper)JavascriptChrome extensionSabre APILyft APIAmadeus APILufthansa APIGoogle Geo APIFuelVideo demo of the technical features: https://youtu.be/KncPJEdiSSg.

"Aristotl","Acessible Academic Assistance","[6892, 'When conversing in group chats with other students, I noticed that many people often posted homework problems that they needed help with. However, often times their questions went unanswered, or the answers they got were unhelpful. That lead me to the idea of a more ""conversational"" academic assistance service - a platform on which students can easily ask bite-sized questions and instantaneously receive answers.I was inspired by HackHands (acquired by Pluralsight in 2015) and CodeMentor (which has raised $3.4M to date), both services that introduced this model to the programming community. I thought that the same model could be applied to other subjects, and so I created Aristotl.Note that while the web app is primarily targeted towards students for now, it could very easily be converted to instead be a platform for technical support, or for job training questions, etc. The sky\'s the limit!  ', '(Check out the demo video above!! :) ) Note: in the demo I was already signed into my Okta account through google, so it didn\'t actually redirect to the google account chooser. The social logins do work, I promise! Feel free to test them out for yourself.A student, needing help with a question, registers for Aristotl - either with an email/pass or with a Google/Facebook account. After entering their information and purchasing credits (for now, just a proof-of-concept - no payment necessary!), the user can converse with an intelligent chatbot that will diagnose their problem. The chatbot can generally determine the subject without being told specifically what it is; ie if a user inputs ""I can\'t do this integral"" it\'ll correctly classify it as a calculus problem. After conversing with the chatbot the user is directed to upload an image of their problem, then is redirected into a private room.The ""tutor"" can then enter the private room and converse in real time with the ""student"". To help illustrate certain concepts, the teacher & student can draw on a collaborative whiteboard component, which updates in real time using websockets. If necessary, either the student or the teacher can initiate a video call with the student by pressing the camera icon.There are a few more features under-the-hood... here\'s a full list:FeaturesReal-time chat with websocketsReal-time \'whiteboard\' component that teachers can useUser can edit data such as gradelevel/biography/account type for better classificationSeparate dashboards and user types (one for students, one for teachers)Students initialize their problem by conversing with an intelligent chatbotChatbot uses NLP (Google Dialogflow) to determine intent and subject of the problemSentiment analysis using the VADER modelEmoji picker for user-to-user chatrooms  (:D)Credits system (perhaps some business viability there... but just a proof-of-concept for now)History + auto-saving feature, allowing students to re-open their issue if need beImage uploads + storage w/ GRIDFSSMS updates for students when they\'re offline but their question receives a response Optional Audio/Video calls - with a cool draggable container!

(2) OpenCVTaking the image, we use OpenCV to perform feature detection and clustering. We then progressively generate a MIDI file by determining the location of key musical objects and assigning them pitches. (3) MIDIFinally, we pipe our fully created MIDI file back to Android, where you can play it right in the app. The total process takes between 5-10 seconds. Challenges we ran intoOn the mobile end, we wanted to make the application target Android 10. This meant carefully navigating various privacy demands that were both scarcely documented, and completely new to our team's developers. Meanwhile on the back end, it was tough performing feature detection and filtering out noise with OpenCV. Accomplishments that we're proud ofDespite the barriers we faced, our team is proud to have created an end-to-end application with so little time. We are also proud to have had such attention to detail, even going as far as to implement complicated animations just to open a dialog in Android. What's next for CapriccioTry out Magenta!Magenta is an open source Python library that explores the role of machine learning in the process of creating art and music. It would be amazing to integrate Magenta into Capriccio, either to extend music by matching our inputs against a database, or to generate chord progressions to enhance a simple melody.
