Upon doing further research, we realized that these terms do not actually convey the expiration date of the product. For example, the term ""best buy"" is when the flavor is the best, not when the product expires. Over 33% of participants in a study conducted last year incorrectly assumed date labeling is federally regulated and another 26% were unsure.

"Regen Network - ReDAOMint","A reDAOmint is a DeFi mechanism that encourages investors to invest in the future ecological health of the planet in a way that generates win-win scenarios for everyone involved","[7775, ""Protecting Earth's most precious natural environments - such as the Amazon rainforest - is often dangerously dependent on unstable political and economic forces. While the Amazon's critical importance as a carbon sink, source of oxygen, and biodiversity hotspot is widely acknowledged worldwide, the local economics in inhabited portions of the forest are often not conducive to protecting this planetary treasure. Instead of relying on government policies and inefficient charities, what if we could create a decentralized economic vehicle that made long-term protection of the forest economically beneficial for local residents?  "", 'For a slide-show presentation see https://bit.ly/redaomint. For a screen-cast see: https://share.getcloudapp.com/NQuejBzyA reDAOmint (regenerative + endowment + DAO + tendermint) is a shareholder DAO that holds a pool of assets for perpetuity, distributing the dividends of those assets with land stewards in critical bioregions in exchange for protecting the land. The DAO funds itself by minting new shares in exchange for valuable market assets that produce dividends or rewards (such as staking tokens).The assets in the DAO are managed by the shareholders who can rebalance the portfolio and move staking tokens to their parent zones over IBC to delegate them and collect rewards. Through good management of the funds, the asset value should grow and produce dividends. The dividends cannot, however, be directly withdrawn by the shareholders - they are instead distributed to land stewards whose good land stewardship has been verified, ideally by a low cost technology such as satellite verification (something Regen Network is already actively working on).Land stewards enter into a contract with the DAO to protect the land, and as long as they keep protecting it they will receive dividends on a regular basis. This provides a continuous supplementary income stream for these land stewards. If, however, they degrade the land by deforesting it, their share of DAO rewards gets slashed, returned to the DAO and they can no longer participate. In this way the reDAOmint acts as a long term financial support vehicle for the land, which goes beyond what unstable government or non-profit support could provide.For investors in the reDAOmint, the investment is not, however, simply a charity and could also be consider a decentralize public hedgefund. reDAOmint shares provide dividends that come in the form of ecosystem service credits. These credits represent unaccounted ecological benefits from protecting the land which is an emerging asset class  estimated to grow from 36B USD in 2017 to 1T USD over next 20 years. An example of these are carbon credits, which will be increasingly demanded by governments and the public. reDAOmint shareholders can either use the ecosystem service credits they have received as dividends for their own offseting purposes or sell them on the market.In comparison to traditional mechanisms for protecting land, a reDAOmint provides the following benefits:insulates land stewards from seasonal variation in the ecological health of landinsulates land stewards from volatility in the price of ecosystem service creditsefficiently generates ecosystem services by good capital managementauditability of all funding and verification activity ', 'The reDAOmint is built using the Cosmos SDK using a fork of cosmos/gaia that includes IBC support. A diff of our work can be seen here: https://github.com/regen-network/reDAOmint/pull/3.We produced two new Cosmos modules and an ORM package to create the reDAOmint.redaomint moduleThe redaomint module implements a shareholder DAO that produces dividends of ecosystem service credits for shareholders and dividends of the underlying asset pool for allocated land stewards as described above. It also provides governance proposal and voting support for shareholders. It uses the existing Cosmos bank and supply modules to track holdings of shares, and interacts with the ecocredit module for verification of good land stewardship and distributing credits. The primary documentation for the module can be found here: https://github.com/regen-network/reDAOmint/blob/reDAOmint/x/redaomint/keeper.goecocredit moduleThe ecocredit module provides a fractional NFT with metadata specific to ecosystem service credits. It allows for:the creation of new credit classes with a list of approved issuersthe issuance of credits for a specific piece of land and time frameexchange of fractional portions of individual creditsburning credits in order to remove them from circulation (in the language of carbon credits this is called retiring and means that you are using the credit as an offset)Documentation here: https://github.com/regen-network/reDAOmint/blob/reDAOmint/x/ecocredit/keeper.goorm packageIn order to make the implementation of the above modules easier, we implemented an orm package to handle secondary indexes and the automatic generation of ID\'s.

In my biomedical research laboratory, people forget to order fresh lab supplies. These supplies include ingredients to a drug, reagents for a diagnostic device... anything! This means we can accidentally be using expired reagents or have development delays because of this oversight. To reduce the burden of needing to remember to order new lab supplies (when it's tough to, when you're in a lab with no computer around...) I made a Amazon Dash-like device with buttons that users can press, which sends an email and text to the lab manager requesting ordering of low supplies.

This price discrepancy is clearly reflected in usage statistics. Today, DEXes mediate less than one percent of daily crypto trading volume. To work towards changing this, we decided to focus on a single segment of the exchange sector, stablecoin swaps, where DEXes have the largest potential cost advantage. Our product, Squink, will enable users to swap between different stablecoins at less than half of the cost of any existing service.   ', 'Squink is an automated market maker that enables extremely low cost swaps between USD stablecoins, e.g. DAI, USDC, and Terra. Fees for utilizing Squink are in the range of 0.05 percent of exchanged volume or $0.50 USD for a $1000 exchange. This is less than half the cost of Binance, the cheapest existing provider. Much like Uniswap, Squink is a lightweight plug n’play module that is easy to integrate into other financial and non-financial products. By integrating Squink, decentralized exchange aggregators can take advantage of small differentials between prices quoted in DAI, USDC, Terra, etc. to save their users substantial amounts of money. Likewise, the exchanges themselves can utilize Squink to aggregate their stablecoin trading pairs into a single integrated order book that offers better prices and deeper liquidity. Finally, e-commerce sites can uitilize Squink to accept any stablecoin, while still receiving payment in their preferred currency.     ', ""Under the hood, Squink uses a generalization of the Uniswap constant product formula that allows for multiple assets and a user-specified level of price volatility.

Although the novelty can be exhilarating, taking flight and seeking out a new social support system may prove to be a daunting task.  Yet, no matter the people we hold close in our lives, from those we’ve known our entire lives to the lab partner we met just a few weeks ago, having those people in our community means the same: ensuring that we feel connected, safe, and taken care of.We wanted to make that process of building and maintaining community easier.  Especially in a major metropolitan city like Austin, safety can be of paramount concern.  Whether they walk, scooter, or rideshare, our final salutation in seeing people off is wishing them safe travels.  Even after departing the nest, Birdie lets you and your loved ones know that those in your community have made it to their destination safely. What is DoesOur app allows users to send/share a history of their location data to those within their community.  The sender presses a button to start their trip, sending friends/family a notification.  From there, receivers can view the person’s trip by viewing the path they followed on a map.  Afterwards, the sender presses a button to end the trip they scheduled, allowing others to know they arrived safely.What Makes it Different?Other location trackers only provide a live view of where people are.  Although this is useful, allowing others to be notified of when you take a trip allows for a practical experience.  For instance, you can send your location on FaceBook messenger, but this can get lost in the messages.  Apps like Strava may be able to track paths you take, but are primarily geared towards running and exercise without having features dedicated to safety.  We wanted an elegant app dedicated for safety that allows for convenient, practical sharing of location.How we Built itWe created our app in Android App Studio, using Google Firebase as a server to store and transmit location data.

At a high school level, we noticed that dividing up into teams, specifically for group projects, was very much inline with privilege - a psychological effect known as in group favoritism. As a result, the effects of inequality became amplified, and social mobility becomes nearly impossible. Similarly, people with similar personality traits tend to group together, which minimizes diversity of thought and leads to, on average, worse team performance (Hoffman and Maier, 1961). Using the ""big five"" personality factors that determine team success (Kichuk and Wiesner, 1997), we created a tool that would prioritize diversity of thought in group creation - with aims of improving group performance and enhancing social mobility. ', 'Students take a short Google Form personality quiz, including short answer questions that are ""graded"" through sentiment analysis.

When teachers create new groups, using a self made GUI, the clusters of likeminded individuals are as split up as possible, leading to teams that reflect optimal diversity. ', 'We used python to create both the GUI and the backend. Using the google-api, we scraped results of the Google Forms and input them into a clustering algorithm powered by sklearn. A one-zero distance metric was used for determining the loss associated with different answers to multiple choice questions. Sentiment analysis was performed by parsing student inputs and searching for positive and negative words (from the canonical list of 6000 training words), and determining which direction the sentiment was more likely to be. On the GUI side, we used tkinter to create a graphic for teacher use. Teachers need only input the URL to google form results and the number of groups they seek to create, and GroupYou will generate the associated teams and display them in the GUI.

"Everett: Reloaded","Think PoS is economically sound? Think again.","[7689, 'With the recent gain of popularity of Proof of Stake (PoS), we have found out that nearly all research focus only on the security aspects of it. Even though PoS vastly changes the economic fundamentals of a blockchain platform, the actual research done regarding the potential problems that could arise was found to be quite lacking compared to its severity.Through our own analysis of PoS, we have discovered quite a few that can be potentially damaging to the ecosystem. The ones found can largely the classified into three categories: Economic, Security, and Market.Economic: Users are given two choices to invest their tokens, staking and DeFi. This causes DeFi lending rates to rise to a level similar to the staking reward rate, decreasing the amount of social benefit generated from DeFi. It also disincentivizes the usage of DeFi, one example being CDP holders having to miss out on potential staking rewards. Interchain transfers of PoS tokens are also disincentivized, as tokens moved outside of their home chain cannot receive staking rewards. The Cosmos network, aiming to connect various different chains, is critically impacted by this.Security: The only way for delegators to hedge in the case of bear markets is to first go through the unbonding process. This also decreases the network security, creating a situation where the security of the network is impacted by the price fluctuation of tokens. Also, ATOMs being used in dApps cannot be delegated and thus unable to contribute to security. This forces token usage to compete with network security, and since less ATOMs will be bonded, this will also cause the Cosmos Hub to have higher inflation.Market: Users are unable to utilize their bonded ATOMs for hedging or speculation purposes. In addition, since the only entity with an incentive to not bond their ATOMs are centralized exchanges (to process withdrawals), a considerable amount of unbonded ATOMs might end up in the hands them. And since only unbonded ATOMs can be traded and contribute to token valuation, the risk of exchanges colluding with each other and manipulating the price might not be that difficult to pull off.As a small addition to the above problems, developed economies have investment products with various amounts of risk and reward. However, for PoS networks, is not the case (Risk: Slashing Possibility. Reward: Delegation Rewards). Even if there are people who truly believe in the platform prefer to take more risks in exchange for a higher amount of rewards, they have no choice but to follow the same risk & reward profiles as everyone else. ', 'With the use of Everett, delegators of the Cosmos Hub are able to mint bATOMs, a secondary shadow token backed by one’s delegation position. Two important features of bATOMs ensure them as an effective solution to the problems mentioned above.Soft Peg with ATOMs: bATOMs are designed to retain the same price with ATOMs. Just like most people treat WETH & ETH and DAI & USD as the same type of asset although they are completely different, by making bATOMs have the same price as ATOMs will minimize the adoption barrier for users and DeFi dApps.Validator Fungibility: Another important feature for maximum usability is issue the same type of tokens independent of which validator the delegator chose to delegate to. Compressing them to a single token ensures both maximum user simplicity and market liquidity.The eventual goal of bATOMs is to become the preferred token of choice for DeFi applications, so that delegators can utilize the bATOMs created using their delegated ATOMs and utilize them on various DeFi applications. This allows users to collect both the delegation rewards and the DeFi dApp interest, eliminating the competitive structure between those two, which in turn maximizes the social benefit.What can I do with itHedging & Speculation: A delegator can now choose to utilize the locked value of their bonded ATOMs are applications like hedging or speculating.Stake & Invest: It is now possible to delegate ATOMs and lend the generated bATOMs through DeFi. Increasing profits for users without causing a decrease in network security.Interchain Staking: Delegators can stake on multiple chains with the same capital by trading bATOMs in exchange for unstaked tokens of other blockchains.Leveraged Delegations: bATOMs can be traded for more unbonded ATOMs, which can be delegated to generate more bATOMs. By repeating this process delegators can effectively leverage on their delegations. This application is further explored by tokenizing the leveraged position and making them available for trading. ', 'As the Cosmos Hub does not support smart contracts or token issuance, it was decided to develop a separate Cosmos Zone that takes care of the smart contract logic and bATOM issuance. To prevent events like slashing from creating undercollateralized LSPs, it was decided to keep 10% of the bonded ATOMs as the slashing collateral. Whenever the slashed amount goes over 5%, the Everett Zone automatically submits an unbonding request to the Cosmos Hub, therefore liquidating the LSP in the risk of undercollateralization.A previously suggested ICS proposal regarding interchain accounts was utilized. This proposal allows the creation of a special address on the Cosmos Hub, which is controlled by Cosmos Zone. This feature is crucial in order for forced liquidations to be triggered in the case of slashings that go beyond the threshold amount.Simplified bATOM Generation Process Generate an Everett Zone controlled user-specific interchain address on the Cosmos Hub Transfer ATOMs to the newly created interchain address Send data including the validator to delegate the transferred ATOMs to A delegate TX is sent to from the Everett Zone to the Cosmos Hub via IBC If all is successful, excluding the slashing collateral of 10%, new bATOMs are granted to the delegator’s addressSimplified ATOM Recovery Process Requests the closure of one’s LSP by submitting a close TX to the Everett Zone The Everett Zone validates whether the user has enough funds in their account If the user’s account contains enough bATOMs, the bATOMs are locked and the ATOM retrieval process is initiated. An unbonding TX is sent from the Everett Zone to the Cosmos Hub If 4 is successful, the locked ATOMs in 3 are burnedA LSP can only be closed by the delegator who initially opened it. The delegator is required to hold the same amount of bATOMs they first created.TLDR of the add-ons done during the hackathon Swapped out our previous pseudo-IBC in exchange for the real thingUse of Interchain Accounts A better frontend for non-aliens Liquid Staking Position (LSP) NFTs, an additional token that has governance rights & receives rewards Tokenized Leveraged LSPs, allowing delegators to choose different risk & reward profiles (e.g. buy 3x leverage LSP tokens to receive 3x the rewards, while the money you lose when slashed also increases 3x.)

"Bounded Chaos","Reinterpreting cellular automata to include a messaging system that allows us to map an input space onto itself in a very unique way. ","[5318, ""Ahmed's short backstory: I was watching tv late one night while living in Brazil, when the signal cut out. I was mesmerized by the random pattern of pixels oscillating on the screen, knowing that a specific percentage of them were caused by cosmic background radiation. Despite the random cosmic element on the tv screen, the pattern was very similar to the deterministic cellular automata I was playing with on my computer. This fascinated me. One pattern was random and the other was deterministic but not chaotic, and yet, the two were indistinguishable from one another. This inspired me to ask the question: if all it takes to create these crazy patterns are a very simple set of deterministic functions mapping onto one another, then what is random, and what really is chaotic? What else would I be able to produce? There's beauty in chaos. Key wordsHilbert (space filling) curveCellular automataRecursive mappingCombinatronicsDebrujin SequencesMemory "", ""We're exploring the evolutionary dynamics of these cellular automata and visualizing them for an audience unfamiliar with the math. We've provided the theoretical underpinning of this framework, coupled with a simple graphical interface that demonstrates the localized effect of the interaction between two arbitrary rules. Cellular automata provide a way to bound chaotic inputs amongst a closed set of states.Independent of how complex your pattern is, you can always recurse deeper into the solution space because you can always generate more intricate inputs to be processed through the rule set that you have. This maximizes the amount of information you're extracting about the patterns in those inputs. This is why chaos is now bounded. You're simply limited by the processing power you have to recurse through this infinite space as compared to the complexity of the pattern you're seeking. "", ""Basically we reinterpreted cellular automata to separate the input space from the message space. What that means is we can run cellular automata in three different ways, forming a chain of actions and interactions. The visualization we created takes an ordered image (gradient mapped along a hilbert curve) and disturb it by passing the inputs through a randomly chosen pair of cellular automata rules and observing the localized effects of their interactions. Message = Rule(Input)Rule(s) = Input(Message)Input(s) = Rule(Input)Passing an input through a rule to receive a message reduces the amount of information we can extract from it, because running that message backwards to extrapolate the initial input in fact can only give you a possibility space that contains probable inputs that generated that message. Sp when you group two rules and a message, what you're creating is a mapping between one input space onto another input space, where only some of those inputs are relevant. To do this, we setup an ordered hilbert curve and used colour to express that order. Then we disturbed that order by choosing two random rules and seeing how the curve visually translates when run through them. The function we used to update the colour values is the same used in reinforcement learning to update the reward expectations.

"Duke Tutor","A Remote Tutoring Platform for Duke Students","[4084, ""We believe that tutoring is an integral component of achieving academic success. Duke's current tutoring system is restrictive with a strict one tutor policy, lacks transparency because of the little to no agency a student has in choosing their tutor, and is expected to be an in person interaction. With so much homework, programming, and projects done on computers and online, there is an opportunity for transparent and flexible tutoring to be made available in this environment. For example, most of the work for EGR 103 requires programming. To supplement face-to-face sessions, tutors may want to access a student's machine remotely and provide assistance.

"", ""Duke tutor is a remote tutoring platform that connects students with tutors and provides a flexible, effective, and interactive tutoring experience. Tutors registered with Duke tutor each have a profile including the class they tutor for, what time slots they can tutor at, and their type of teaching style. When students access Duke tutor, they first pick the class they want a tutor for and are presented a calendar of all tutors and their available times for that class. Students have the ability to view each tutor's profile to evaluate which tutor best matches them. A choice is made when the student chooses the name of the tutor, the time slot, and the learning style the best identify with. Once the request is verified, an email is sent to both the tutor and student including a link to the virtual tutoring session as well as a feedback form. The virtual session includes functions such as voice chat, screen share, and the control of a device from another device. After the virtual session both tutors and students will complete the feedback form rating the effectiveness of the session.

Probus will have an initial offering of tokens and then move to a generative model where more participation on the platform will lead to the creation/issuing of more tokens. Smart flagging is done by agents wherein a set number of agents participate in voting on whether a piece of content should be flagged or not. The ""winning"" agents, or those who are with the majority consensus, are rewarded with Probo tokens.

When the “CALL” button is pressed, the application would use the GPS to get the user’s location and use text-to-speech to convert the address into sound form so that the police would hear it — however, no sound would come out from the phone so that the user can remain undiscovered.Furthermore, when the “MESSAGE” button is pressed, the application would lead to a screen where the user can choose which counselor she/he wants to receive counseling and support from and start texting anonymously with the counselor. The counselor would not be able to see the phone number or any other personal information of the user, because the user is never required to enter anything.Accomplishment-We created a clearly-manifested home screen with only two buttons to press as well as a location detection function so that users who need to call the police can do it right away.-The Message function was created on a second screen, where the user can select a counsellor, sending text messages to the selected counselor, receive responses, and the latest messages are displayed.-The Call function would directly call 911 as soon as the user presses the button.ChallengesAll of our team members were first-time hackers entirely new to the field of application development.

', ""Login or sign up in the main page, the user's first name, last name, email and password would be collected and saved on Cloud Firestore database (which is powered by Firebase) for later login check. After successful login or signup, the user would be guided to the search page. On this page, he/she can use Google map to locate his/her position, he/she can also specify search radius within which medical centers and hospitals would be fetched from the MEDICARE HOSPITAL COMPARE DATASET. Then the user would be displayed with the distances and names of the hospitals and medical centers. Upon clicking on a specific hospital name, he could get the route on how to get to that hospital or medical center. Detailed information including address in text form, as well as overall rating of the facility would also be offered to the user. "", ""We started from defining different functionalities we would like to achieve. Then we dice deep into the corresponding components our app should include for those functionalities. Our implementation is in Xcode. We implement the backend using Google Firebase. More specifically, we user Firebase authentication library for user login and signup, and Firestore to store user information. We choose Firebase out of the consideration of reliability and stability. To fetch hospital and medical center information, we call API offered by the MEDICARE HOSPITAL COMPARE DATASET by giving a URL including the geolocation information of the user and the search radius defined by him/her. We've also added the functionalities of displaying route to the hospital and rating of it after the user pick one from the search results. "", ""The backend part was kind of challenging since neither of us had used Firebase as backend previously. But we made to learn how to use it and integrated with our Swift codes. Also using MapView in Xcode to locate user was hard at the beginning since we had not used this component previously. Debugging in the TableView part for displaying hospitals was really tricky. Last but not least: Hold on and don't give up! "", ""We're proud of the persistence both team members demonstrate under pressure. Both of us were newbies for some of the technologies in this project but we stood together and managed to accomplish the goals we set at the beginning. We're proud of the great collaboration between us and valued that as a great experience to learn how to work together with a short deadline. Last but not least, we are happy that we've managed to deliver something that is practical and can help solving a real health and wellness problem. "", ""A lot. We've learned new technologies and tools. We've learned how to be well disciplined under pressure. We've also learned how to collaborate and accomplish tasks with a short deadline. "", ""We would like further improve our UI design, offering more information on hospitals and medical centers. Another useful feature we consider to implement is to cache the search history of user locally in user's device. Then next time when he enters the app he can just check out the past search results if he wants instead of locating and searching again. Also adding features like making appointments to visit the hospital or medical center in the app, rating for the hospital the user has visited in our app will be part of the future work.

But there was a problem – while some shelters and donation drives overflowed with supplies, others were still empty-handed. Donations were often abundant in certain areas of the city, while the under-served communities that need them most went without. This inspired Full House- a system for managing and balancing the inventory of multiple shelters and leveling the playing field. ', 'Full House has two main functions.  First, to help shelters manage their inventory by determining scarcity or surplus. And second, to connect shelters with others that may have the supplies that they need. Full House accomplishes this with a search tool that lets users easily query the inventory, and with a dashboard that recommends other shelters.  ', ""The core of our product is connecting shelters together based on need. In order to get our data, we scraped Goodwill stores for product information, formatted them to be stored in our Mongo DB database, and kept track of their specific categories. With a set of categories, we could easily show what percentage of a shelter's inventory is made of a certain category, and allow shelters to specify what percentage they require.

"Chladni Plates: Simulation vs. Reality","We built physical Chladni Plate setup, which is a way to visualize the creation of standing sound waves. We also programmed a simulated Chladni plate in order to see the differences between the two.","[4334, ""We were inspired by demonstrations of this effect shown on Youtube. We wanted to see if we could build a simulator to arrive at the same results and to build our own Chladni plate from scratch. This initial inspiration was incubated by Dawson's SPACE extracurricular program who sponsored our presence at the hackathon and gave us all the opportunities we needed to succeed. "", 'In the physical model, we use an online tone generator to send sine wave sound frequencies to a speaker through a guitar amp. The speaker is attached to a driving rod, which acts as the vibration source for a metal plate attached to it. The vibration produces standing waves on the plate. By sprinkling salt on the plate we can visualize the nodal lines on the plate, as the salt will displace towards those line, away from the parts of the plate that are moving.The simulation displays a graph that represents a possible pattern of a square Chladni plate. Using interactive sliders you can change parameters to change the shape of the pattern to see other possibilities. ', 'We modded a guitar amp, replacing the built-in speaker with a speaker with a plastic cap, which allowed us to attach the driving rod to the center of the speaker. The driving rod is attached to the plate at the center. In order to keep the rod upright, we built a wooden support base which is mounted to the speaker. The simulation uses a given formula for representing the nodal lines of a Chladni plate derived from the 2D wave equation. Using a plotting library in Python we graphed the equation, displaying the Chladni pattern for the given parameters. ', 'Building the physical Chladni plate came with a host of challenges. Given our lack of construction resources, cutting the materials down to size and drilling the necessary holes took a good deal of time. Also, the patterns produced on the physical Chladni plate are very different from the complex patterns produced in the simulation, due to the nature of the build and the limitations of the materials. Plotting the equation ended up being more difficult than expected, as the library we used does not have an easy way of representing implicit curves (like the equation we are using). Another big challenge was getting the interactivity to work properly. However, we were able to eventually get over these challenges and arrived at the final product. ', 'The proudest accomplishment is that we actually managed to get both the physical and simulated demos to work in some degree. The challenges we had to deal with took a considerable amount of time and research to work through, as we are all happy that we arrived at a finished product we can be proud of. ', 'We had two major takeaways from this project. First, the math and physics of Chladni plates is much more complicated than any of us expected, involving 4th-degree PDEs and eigenfunctions, both of which are way above our level of knowledge as cegep students. Second, it is very difficult to build real simulations of physical phenomena in a way that closely fits the theoretical predictions. There are so many variables to take into account in the real world that being able to create a theoretically consistent simulation is a very difficult and impressive feat.   ', 'With some more research, we hope to be able to find the relationship between the driving frequency and the patterns produced by the plate so that the simulation can be adapted to accept frequency inputs. Once we have a better understanding of the physics, we hope we can also simulate non-square plates, eventually arriving at simulations for arbitrary plate shapes. However, given that the math is complicated enough for square plates, we recognize that the second goal would require extensive research and significant dedication to complete.

"Waitlist of Lucidity","Crowdsourced waitlist sizes for UT Austin Registration","[3540, ""It's registration season at UT Austin again! In a time that's supposed to be filled with hope and excitement, however, many students dread the prospect of seeing all their classes fill up before they register, not knowing which section of a class has the shortest waitlist to sign up for because UT doesn't show the size of a waitlist until a student is already on it. For example, a student picking the waitlist for a class section at random could end up at spot #20. However, he wouldn't know that he could have signed up for a section with only 2 people on the waitlist. After seeing our classmates struggle over the years with getting the classes they need, we decided on a solution of transparency that would let everyone share with each other the sizes of all the waitlists they are on, ultimately enabling them to make an informed decision.

Our image data was sorted into 6 categories — potholes, graffiti, broken sidewalks, signs covered by trees, broken traffic signs, or littering — after we uploaded our dataset to the Google Cloud Console.  Through the use of Google’s Cloud AutoML Machine Learning system, we developed a deep learning Neural Network Image Classifier that identified images and placed them into one of our five categories with an average precision of 0.981.  Additionally, the frequency of false positives generated by our model was 5.00%, and the frequency of false negatives was 9.52%. Prior to using Google’s Cloud AutoML, we experimented with Apple’s CreateML to develop models for our image classification system.  While CreateML served as a useful placeholder, we experienced difficulties in achieving a high enough level of image identification precision with this software.  After we managed to get AutoML working, we replaced CreateML with AutoML and our app’s functionality increased significantly.After creating a working machine learning model, we focused on the app development aspect of our project.  We originally attempt to develop both Android and Ios versions of our app, but we eventually decided to just focus on Ios.  We intend to develop an Android app after the completion of HackDuke, since we intend to eventually place our product on the app store.  We developed a basic UI to allow the user to change the category of the maintenance request (for the rare cases when AutoML fails to classify the incident correctly).  Following that, the user is asked 2-3 additional questions about the event.  These questions come from the City of Durham website. Lastly, the information about the incident is emailed to the correct person within the City of Durham maintenance department, along with the address of the incident and the photo of it.ChallengesInitially, we used Apple’s Create ML app to develop a machine learning model that would predict the type of environmental issue we categorized based on Durham One Call’s form.  CreateML was unable to create a model for us that was precise enough for our needs, and often misidentified maintenance incidents even after extensive training.  We solved this challenge through the use of Google’s AutoML system instead. We were really excited that our neural network was fully functioning after training for two hours. However, we believe that if our data set had provided a more extensive and accurate depiction of all of our categories, we could develop a significantly more accurate Neural Network Image Classifier.  Unfortunately, due to the time constraints and lack of a data set which we were faced with, we were unable to achieve a more accurate machine learning program within 24 hours.Another challenge we faced was developing the app from Android, since, none of us had any Android App Development experience.  We were unable to overcome this challenge in the allotted time, and so we instead decided to focus solely on developing an IOS app.What's nextMoving forward, we would like to get QuickReport to work with the Durham One Call website. Furthermore, we plan on developing our app to address environmental and maintenance issues in other locations in North Carolina (e.g. Raleigh) as well as around the world. For instance, Raleigh also has a convoluted online request form for resolving street issues that must be filled out by a user.

"", 'We used python2 and python3 with getOldTweets to pull the Twitter post information, Google Sentiment Analysis API to generate sentiment information.For the data analysis, Jupyter Notebook was used in conjunction with Java Swing to help visualize these plot in an clean GUI fashion. ', 'Twitter Analysis:Initially, we wanted to use Tweepy to pull relevant tweets of specific locations and date ranges because of previous experience in using it. Assigning locations was a bit odd: rather than taking in a location by keyword as a string (ex: ""Melbourne""), Tweepy actually requires the input of the top left and bottom coordinates of corners of a geographical box selection of that location. Pulling from the Google Maps Places API, we were able to pull this information. We then realized that Tweepy strictly pulls from the most recent tweets... there was no way to access past posts. We then decided to pivot and try to use Twitter\'s official API, until we learned Twitter\'s API has specific regulations on accessing tweets only within the past two weeks.With some in-depth Google Searches, we found a script on GitHub called getOldTweets that pulled historical Tweets using a unique method. Unfortunately, the update of the code from python2 to python3 was incomplete, thus while  location searching was available, date range queries weren\'t. However, both features still existed in the python2 version of the code. We decided to just write and run this scraping of the Twitter posts in python2, and write everything else in python3.Another challenge was that we are both computer science majors who did not have much experience in data analysis. Dealing with huge datasets in the hundreds-of-thousands was new territory to us, and it truly taught us a lot about how to deal with data. For example, we found that many entries of the data had to be discarded due to being unreasonable outliers or sparse entries. We also had to implement an efficient algorithm that could process all of this data in a reasonable time, which was done with a bit of dynamic programming in addition to concurrent processing to speed up our dataset retrieval. In addition, we had to figure out how to implement a Java GUI to show all of our data plots, so getting Java and Python to interface together was an interesting challenge.

"DrinkSafely","Alcohol poisoning is a rampant problem across America. Our wearable aims to keep users safe by helping them pace drinks and water, by counting drinks, and by being able to contact emergency services.","[2842, 'We were initially inspired because we saw a problem in our own Duke Community. So many of our peers and even our friends overdose on alcohol and require emergency services. Every weekend, and even many weekdays, we see several ambulances going to pick up another student with alcohol poisoning. This is not only a problem at Duke, but a widespread epidemic at Colleges throughout the U.S. Every year, more than 1500 students die from an alcohol overdose. For our project, we wanted to create something to combat that stunning statistic. Thus our idea to bridge into alcohol safety was born.What it DoesOur project is a wearable that counts the amount of drinks you’ve taken, reminds you to hydrate, times when you can have another drink, and gives you an easy way to contact an emergency number if something went wrong. Specifically, our wearable has a RGB LED light and a piezoelectric sensor. On a timer, the LED lights up blue and sends the user a text reminder about drinking water. Similarly, the wearable times how long between drinks and tells the user when it is ok to drink again, to allow the user to pace themselves throughout the night. Our wearable counts the amount of drinks by the person double tapping on the sensor. Finally, our wearable will contact an emergency number, when the person triple taps the sensor. How We Built ItFirst, we tried to build the project on a Particle Photon board. We were unable to flash code on this device, so we ended up switching to an Arduino. We uploaded firmata code on the Arduino. Firmata allows a python program on a laptop to control and read pins on the Arduino. We then wrote a python program that reads sensor values and sends SMS messages to a specific phone number. Finally, we soldered a circuit that includes the piezoelectric sensor and an RGB LED to a protoboard and protoshield. What We LearnedWe mainly learned the basics of hardware prototyping. We had to program an Arduino and wire up a LED and sensor circuit. We also learned how to design and solder a custom protoboard. We had to make sure it was durable so we hot glued all the connections. After this project, we feel more equipped to try more electronics prototyping in the future. Challenges We FacedWe initially wanted to use a Particle Photon board to read sensor input and send out SMS messages. Unfortunately, we had a lot of trouble setting up the board. Despite hours of troubleshooting, we could not flash code onto the board. In the end, we decided to work with an Arduino instead. We were able to restructure code and upload code onto this microcontroller which solved our previous issue.

"Teeter Toddler","Worried about leaving your child with a sitter? You may have cameras, but can't they see everything. Teeter Toddler is a small device that takes real-time data capable of sensing if your child is safe","[7437, ""What inspired us the most during our stay here at WHACK, was the drive to push ourselves into doing a project outside our skill set . What we decided to do as a team was, find an issue in today's world we could make a difference in by creating something in the allotted 32 hours. It was then that our idea sparked. A device that could track the safety of your child and alert you of possible harmful or dangerous situations your child may face while you're away from them, thus creation a sense of relief for said parent/parents. Most importantly increasing the safety of young children and newly born infants. "", ""Our project begins with a Texas Instruments CC2541 Sensor Tag. The sensor tag is then sewn into a baby's onesie or if the child is older, could also be attached to the exterior of their clothing. The CC2541 has the capability to collect IR Temperature, Ambient Temperature, Proximity, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Simple Keys, Humidity, Barometer, and Magnetometer data real time. For our project we focused on the Accelerometer, Gyroscope, and Ambient Temperature data that was being collected. The application Teeter Toddler does the rest, monitoring the data collected for any abnormalities or sudden changes in the babies movement which may indicate poor handling of the child, which may place the child in danger (Shaken Baby Syndrome). If the sensor detects such data, it immediately sends an audible notification alarm to the user informing them of the situation. The same is done with the Ambient Temperature data collected, if the baby is in a possible harmfully cold or hot environment, the user receives a notification to check on them. For temperature data, it is constantly being displayed to the user via the app. As the temperature falls or raises the app begins to alert the user via notifications, unless the temperature hits a dangers level and then the application sends an audible alarm. The goal here was to provided parents with protection and a sense of ease that their children are well taken care of in their absence in real time. That's not all, at first we look at this solution as a way to monitor others who look after our children but then came to a realization. The application could also be used in other ways, for instants. With the data being collected in real time, a new mother/father could use this same application to ensure safe handling of their child in their own hands. Also a growing problem we noticed in the news is the amount of cases where parents, perhaps due to stress or other factors, forget their children in the car during hazardous conditions. Teeter Toddler could be the determining factor in those precious few minutes of life or death, all with a simple yet accurate notification alert. With the Gyroscope and temperature data collected we could help prevent some of the top leading sleep environmental factors leading to Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Factors like the infant sleeping on their stomach or side. Babies placed in these positions to sleep might have more difficulty breathing than those placed on their backs, with the Gyroscope data we can help further prevent this. Another example is overheating, being too warm while sleeping can increase a baby's risk of SIDS. With both Ambient Temperature and IR temperature at our disposal, we could lower the number of cases reported with a simple app. "", 'The CC2541 is a power-optimized true system-on-chip (SoC) solution for both Bluetooth low energy and proprietary 2.4-GHz applications. It enables robust network nodes to be built with low total bill-of-material costs. The CC2541 combines the excellent performance of a leading RF transceiver with an industry-standard enhanced 8051 MCU, in-system programmable flash memory, 8-KB RAM, and many other powerful supporting features and peripherals. We also experimented with other microcontrollers, but in order to keep it small enough to not be bothersome to the child and still big enough not to be a choking hazard we stuck with the CC2541. Once attached, the CC2541 begins to collect real time data and passes it along into our application. The application side was developed within Evothings Studios and Workbench. This allowed us to create an application capable to run in both Android and Apple Operating Systems using JavaScript and HTML. Libraries such as Easyble.js and Tisensortag.js played an instrumental role in our final product. ', 'With a collective of very little experience in hardware and application development, getting started was a lot hard than we first envisioned. Nevertheless we had a goal in mind and worked as a team to further strengthen ourselves more into the subject we knew could use some polishing. Documentation on the TI CC2541 sensor tag was difficult to find since the company has since released newer versions of the sensor tag. This made it particularly difficult for us to properly extract the information we needed, but with some heavy duty digging we were able to find what we needed to make it all come together. ', ""Since we are Cyber Security students, we normally only focus on cyber security related projects  Yet instead we took what was said at opening ceremony to heart and decided to try something new to all of us.Finding a real world problem and solving it with something we made. To come out of all of that after 32 hours of not sleeping with a working prototype couldn't make our team any prouder. "", ""Asking what we didn't learn would be a smaller response. Even though 32 hours doesn't seem like a long time, one can definitely feel it. Practically every piece required to make our project work, meant a team member/members stopping what they were doing to do an hour or two of research to continue to stride forward towards the finish line. The most valuable thing we learned this weekend is that just because we know how to find exploit and vulnerabilities in things like apps and hardware components. It is a totally different prospective in building them that requires additional knowledge. "", 'Our team has decided to continue with this project after WHACK.

"BitWise","Anyone can help label complex datasets with our 20 questions like app and make money in the process.","[5522, 'Datasets for machine learning like ImageNet have created so much value and are an incredibly important part of the future. However, barely anyone can help label them. With over a thousand classes, even excluding the prevalence of very specific nouns and species of animals like birds, the task of knowing every class in such a large dataset is incredibly hard. We wanted to improve this and allow anyone to help researchers and companies label datasets while making a little money in the process.  ', 'Instead of requiring people to learn the intricacies of image datasets, we propose treating image labeling like a game of 20 (or N) questions. Users are tasked with answering the same binary question for groups of images of the same decision node. As users answer these questions, images are propagated further down the tree iteratively until they are classified. Users gain points for each image they classify and can redeem these in the future for gift cards. There are multiple advantages for this solution. By giving users much of the same mental task in a row, people don’t have to constantly shift their attention to different classification tasks and can therefore work more efficiently and have greater accuracy. One challenge arises in this solution: how do you produce binary questions at scale for a very large, specific dataset? For this, we use WordNet, a NLP dataset that encodes the hyponyms and hypernyms (supersets and subsets of words) in a tree. Since any tree can be binarized, we can create a new question set for almost any dataset instantly. We can use a Least Common Ancestor algorithm to find the lowest common branch of the tree for all needed categories and shake the tree to decrease the number of classifications needed per image.With BitWise, we can significantly increase the number of people who can help label datasets and do it at a greater speed than ever before. People can also make money in an ethical and equitable way in the process. ', 'Our backend is built with a REST API in Flask connected to a MongoDB database in Python. One of the advantages of using a non-relational database like MongoDB is that we can represent our database like an actual tree. We calculate the tree structure using WordNet, a dataset that maps the semantic field relationships (supersets and subsets of words) between words in a tree-like structure, binarizing the tree. We implemented a custom scheduler to navigate the tree and find the next best images a user should classify. We also host our static images on-server. Currently, our app is configured to use a subset of ImageNet called TinyImageNet. However, this is easily configurable. This is all deployed on Google Cloud.Our frontend is a React Native app compiled with the Expo toolchain, written in Javascript. The app sends a GET request to our API to get new image URLs, IDs and categories to classify from our scheduler, and sends a POST request back for each image classified with an image id and a boolean. The database is updated in real-time and can support simultaneous users as well as users exiting the app and never classifying images.

This inspired us to create Clip It, a tool that can programmatically create highlight reels of Twitch streams in a matter of seconds. ', ""Clip It allows you to find the highlights of your favorite streams. Given the URL for a video, it finds the highlights by tracking two key metrics:1) Local spikes in chat message frequency (i.e. the equivalent of volume level in Twitch chat). We keep a rolling median of the number of messages sent in consecutive 30-second windows; and window that is significantly higher than the local median could be of interest!2) Sentiment magnitude of the chat messages. To detect this, we used Google Cloud Platform's natural language processing-based sentiment analysis API, which returns sentiment score (i.e. positive or negative) and sentiment magnitude (how positive or negative). We focused on just sentiment magnitude, as that will pick out an interesting and wide variety of events, from controversial to exciting moments! Once again, we track local spikes in sentiment magnitude compared to the rolling median to find clips of interest.We then look at the product of the differences between each metric and its rolling median--the clips with the highest value for this number therefore have large spike in both metrics. We return the timestamps with the highest values to make our highlight reel!

In order to solve this problem, we decided to create a utility to help users find and map the closest EV charging station dynamically, based on the charge of the EV and projected route. If we can solve this commonplace issue among prospective buyers, we can encourage more people to buy EVs, thereby reducing global emissions and improving the carbon footprint on the environment.

First we check if it's weekend and then divide the time into AM and PM and check what they're doing at that time and whether to call or not. we put the result into variable suggest. For weekdays, we have different time schedules; we check what they're doing at that time and give the suggestions.Finally, we use a message box to display all the variables and let the clients know what the person is doing at that time and whether they should call or not.  "", ""We have no experience with Uipath, and we don't even know how to start at first. But we decide to learn it, and watch lots of demos online. For analyzing data part, we have tons of if statements to deal with. (eg. check if it's bed time, lunch time, work time and etc.) However, it's impossible for us to put every time in the condition. We try to convert the time to integer and then use > or < to find a time range, but it fails since time (eg. 11:30) cannot be converted into 32 integer. And then we try to convert time to string variable and compare strings. But it fails since for 1:00,  the second character is ':', but for 11:00, the second character is  '1'; ascii of '1' will be definitely smaller than ':', so it will show us that '1:00'>'11:00'. Finally we figure out this by using time.Contains(), and we made it! "", 'We work out a time schedule for the person we want to call very specifically. We take consideration whether it is weekdays or weekend and even when ""they\'re on their way to work"" or ""they\'re on their way home"".
