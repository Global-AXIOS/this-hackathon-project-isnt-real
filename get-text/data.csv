"CodingBoard","Improve your coding skillsets by compiling your whiteboard anywhere, anytime","[4504, 'First off, as students, with little to no time, we constantly seek resources to aid us in furthering our education. One effective method of improving our coding skill set is writing our code on paper or whiteboard. Unfortunately, this method requires more time due to the slow nature of later reviewing and rewriting the code into the compiler in order to test it.

"ReadToMe","This is a Deep Learning enabled application which is able to read books to kids","[9523, 'The inspiration behind ReadToMe came from my kids. Specifically, my younger two who are 3 and 5. Both kids love books, but they aren’t reading by themselves yet. I wanted to create something that they could use to still enjoy reading, even when a parent isn’t available to read to them. ', 'ReadToMe works by using deep learning and computer vision combined with services available in AWS. Just show the DeepLens a page you want it to read, and it reads it out loud. ', 'As simple as the workflow sounds, there were many challenges that had to be overcome to get this to work. These are the individual problems I needed to solve.Determine when a page that needs to be read is in the camera frameIsolate the Text Block and clean up the image using OpenCVPerform OCR (Optical Character Recognition)Transform text into audioPlay back the audio through speakersEach one of the above steps introduced unexpected challenges, (some of which made me question if I would be able to finish this project in time!)Determining when a page that needs to be read is in the camera frameFor the DeepLens to be able to read a page, it needed some way to know if there is something in the camera frame to read. This is where the deep learning model was used. I looked online but could not find a pre trained model that was able to classify a page in a book. As a result, I knew I would need to train a model with new data to classify this type of object.To get training data, I did a quick search online to try and find images of children’s books. I found tons of images of book covers, but practically nothing showing someone holding the book in the correct orientation for me to be able to train with. I needed images of the actual pages with text on them. Fortunately, I have four young kids, and they have hundreds of children’s books. So, one night I grabbed about forty books, and started taking lots of pictures of myself holding the different books in different orientations, lighting, and with my hand occluding different parts of the page.During this process, I started to realize that the blocks of text in these children’s books varied greatly. Sometimes the text was white on black, or sometimes black on white. Other times it was colored text on different colored backgrounds. Sometimes the text ran along the bottom of the page, and some books had text all over the page with no logical flow. So, I decided to narrow my focus and only capture images of books that had text in a “somewhat normal” positioning. I figured that if I tried to get too broad of a dataset that I would end up with a model that thought everything was a block of text. Down the road maybe I can experiment with more varied types of data but for this project I decided to limit it.After I captured the data, I used labelImg to generate the Pascal VOC xml files that would be used in training.At this point, I got stuck trying to figure out how to get my data formatted correctly to be trained with MXNet. I found a few examples using TensorFlow and so that is the road I went down. I figured if I finished the project, I could always go back and get it working using MXNet if I had extra time at the end.I was able to follow one of the examples I found on YouTube and ended up with a working model that I could use to detect text on a page.Perform Optical Character RecognitionI was surprised how easy it was to integrate Tesseract into the project. Just install it on the device and pip install the python package and then the workflow was really just a single function call. You provide an image to process, and it just spits out text. I was originally going to use a separate Lambda function with Tesseract installed to perform the OCR, but I ended up just including it in my main Lambda function because it was simpler and cut down on traffic to and from AWS. The actual OCR didn’t seem to take up too much compute power and compared to the round trip to AWS, the time seemed to be comparable. Plus, now I am doing more ""at the edge"" which is more efficient and costs less.There was one gotcha with Tesseract. It is very picky about the image quality. I had to spend a considerable amount of effort figuring out how to clean up the images enough to get a clean read. It also wants you to have the text almost completely horizontal, (which is pretty much impossible considering I want preschool aged children to be able to use this thing)I used OpenCV for most of this image pre-processing and after a number of iterations, I was able to produce images that were plain black and white text with minimal noise. This was key to getting this project to work. The end results were better that I expected, however, there is still room for improvement in this area.Transform text into audioThis step was the easiest of the whole project. Once I could get audio to play on the device, I was able to encapsulate this logic into a single function call which simply calls AWS Polly to generate the audio file. I never write the file to disk, I just feed the byte stream to the audio library and discard it when it’s done playing. I do have a few static mp3 files that are played on startup of the Green Grass service. I use the audio files to speak instructions to the user so they know how to use the device. I figure there was no reason to call Polly to generate this speech as it never changes so I generated them ahead of time and deploy it with the Lambda. (I love how easy it is to integrate existing AWS services into my projects!)Play back the audio through speakersGreen Grass requires you to explicitly authorize all the hardware that your code has access too. One way you can configure this through the Group Resources section in the AWS IOT console. Once configured, you deploy these settings to the DeepLens which results in a JSON file getting deployed greengrass directory on the to the device.To enable Audio playback through your Lambda, you need to add two resources. The sound card on the DeepLens is located at the path “/dev/snd/”. You need to add both “/dev/snd/pcmC0D0p” and “/dev/snd/controlC0” in order to play sound.As an aside, You will need to re-add these resources every time you deploy a project to the device. At the time of this writing, Green Grass overwrites the resources file with a pre-configured group.json whenever you deploy a project to DeepLens. Accomplishments that I\'m proud ofI was very happy with the end results of this project. In spite of having a full-time job and four kids, I was able to create something really cool and get it to actually work reasonably well in just a couple months. I have more ideas for future projects with this device and am excited to keep learning.What I learnedBefore diving into this project, I had no experience with Deep Learning or AI in general. I have always been interested in the topic but it always seemed to unapproachable to ""normal developers"". I have discovered, through this process, that it is possible to to create real useful deep learning projects without a PhD in math, and that with enough effort, and patience anyone with a decent development background can start using it.What\'s next for Read To MeI have a few ideas for improving the project. One feature I would like to add is the ability to translate the text that is read. (I signed up for early access to Amazon’s new Translate service but haven’t yet been approved.)I also plan to continue to improve my model to see if I can increase the model accuracy a bit as well as make it work with a broader range of books.Lastly, the text image cleanup function function, which feeds directly into Tesseract, can be improved. Specifically, it would be beneficial to be able to rotate and or warp the image before sending it to Tesseract. That way when a child isn’t holding the book correctly, it could still read the text. Motion blur was also a definite issue I had to contend with in image cleanup. If the book isn’t held very still for a few seconds, the image is just to blurry for the OCR to work. I have read about various techniques to solve this problem, like using image averaging over multiple frames, or applying different filters to the image to smooth out the pixels. I am sure that it\'s possible to achieve a better/faster outcome but it\'s tricky working on a resource constrained device.

I have read about various techniques to solve this problem, like using image averaging over multiple frames, or applying different filters to the image to smooth out the pixels. I am sure that it's possible to achieve a better/faster outcome but it's tricky working on a resource constrained device.

"Swop","Trustless peer-to-peer auction-based marketplace of non-refundable flight tickets","[3137, ""Being frequent travellers ourselves exploring the world full of possibilities, we have booked several flights in the past whenever there are promotional fares offered by different airlines. But more often than not, due to the busy and unpredictable nature of our jobs, our schedules change and there were some instances where we have to let go of those precious time for families and ourselves. This even causes greater pain realizing that the money used to book those flights in advance will go to waste.We value youOver at Swop, we value the money you earned from grueling hours of hard work. We understand that sometimes it is inevitable to let go of those missed flights but we are not in agreement that you should also let go of the money you used to booked them. We are providing an alternative to salvage that money so you can still use it for your future vacation plans because every one deserves a good vacation once in a while and enjoy life.How we built itWith our mantra of exploring the world full of possibilities, Swop uses the latest blockchain technology. Blockchain puts the power in people's hands while still maintaining security of your data. This enables any person with a valid flight booking to post their flights on the application and make it available for swopping without revealing your identity. This also remove the need to transact directly to the airlines as the application will do it for you.Challenges we ran intoWhile we are very hopeful of the aim of our application to help people, there is one challenge that we need to hurdle which is the cooperation of the airlines. We need the airline to open up this possibility of changing the existing booking and opening up an api for this application. At first it may look as an additional effort to the airline but we believe that this can help the airline's image to the general consumers in the long run. Airlines that participate in this initiative can provide their loyal patrons more satisfaction knowing that as a buyer of the ticket, even though schedules change, they will not totally lose their hard-earned money by providing an option to swop their tickets. The airline also can maximize their resources by flying with almost no vacant seat which is more environment-friendly.What's nextWe hope this solution will gain traction and change the way the travellers book their flights. We hope airline companies will be aligned with this proposal. We also hope that other major players in the industry, such as Amadeus, who have been providing the best industry solutions to power the travel industry to partner with us.

"EMICUS","A device that knows how you feel and keeps you emotionally healthy","[6502, 'Emotions that we keep boxed-up and don’t express – whether we choose to or find it difficult to do so – loom to threaten emotional health down the road.Some of us just aren’t good at expressing our emotions, or even special needs that makes it especially difficult for us, so others have difficulty relating with us (autism). Some of us are far from home or from friends for long periods, so we want someone to check up on how we’re feeling (astronauts). And all of us go through rough patches at some point in our lives, so it’d be nice to have a friend who checks up on how we feel (psych patients).And all of these factors can eventually lead to people having a violent outburst or breakdown, and make us sick. We are convinced that emotional health is just important as, and in some ways even more than, physical health. The true remedy is network of people – friend and family who will check up on how we’re feeling, but we that is a privilege that not all of us have and certainly not all the time. What if, technology could be this friend that understands how we feel? ', '(Physiological mechanism) Whenever we think or feel, our neurons produce tiny electrical signals. And we can detect these signals just by placing some electrodes right onto the scalp. This is called electroencephalogram or EEG, and it paints us a picture of what is going on inside the brain. Because it’s such a powerful tool, it’s the gold standard in any neuro research from sleep studies to diagnosis of neurological diseases and coma state.The device we chose is the Muse Headband. It is a portable 7-lead EEG monitor that just comfortably slips on, fits all, and can be kept on for long times. And by processing the EEG that the Muse generates, we can understand – or at least generally categorize – what you’re feeling. The EEG measures voltage fluctuations, which have different amplitudes and frequencies. They look specifically at the gamma band, a specific range of frequency (“emotional evaluation”). ', '(Data Transfer) The real-time data from the Muse Headband is sent to the laptop over Bluetooth. We used Node JS to “chunk” the data into 30-second segments. (Signal Processing) We retrieve the EEG data from the Muse band, and extract the measurement of microvoltage measurements. The Muse SDK conducts band filtering on the dataset to remove extreme values and noises. Then, we conduct a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which gives us the amplitude and frequency of electrical signals at each data point. We average the amplitudes within the gamma wave frequency range, which results in a value called PSD (Power Spectral Density). We isolate the PSD values in the gamma band range.(Baseline Establishment) According to numerous peer-reviewed research articles, it has been found that high PSD is caused by generally unpleasant emotions (low valency), and low PSD is caused by generally positive emotions (high valency). Each person has slightly varying PSD values, so for each subject we need to establish a baseline. The emotions studied (happy, anger, confused, disgusted) were simulated by showing video clips. Future PSD values are categorized into positive and negative emotions using statistical analysis.(Server-client Model) After the signals are processed, the data is transferred to AWS EC2 Server. The server communicates with the client, which is the mobile app in this scenario. We created a Emicus.tech domain for our sponsor, .tech.  ', 'Among the challenges we ran into were the signal processing aspect. The Muse Headband actually has a lot more variables, including accelerometer data. Isolating what we needed specifically was an initial challenge. Another major challenge was interpreting the EEG data. However, we were able to find papers and MATLAB toolkits that allowed us to perform these complex calculations such as FFT and PSD easily.We were fortunate enough to be allowed to use the Muse Headband and Amazon Echo from MLH.  ', 'We are particularly proud of our real-time monitoring function and our mobile application. The real-time monitoring had high accuracy in many subjects, often even before baseline testing. We are also proud of our mobile application (JavaScript) and the fluidity of the UI.  ', 'We learned how physiological phenomena are extremely complex, yet there are incredible tools out there from hardware, functions and toolboxes that allow us to peek into the inner workings of human physiology. ', 'In the immediate term (days), we want to make the Epicus much more accurate. We could use these datasets to drastically improve our accuracy and sensitivity by using machine learning. We found a few research labs that publicly share EEG data categorized by emotions. However, they required us to return a signed confidentiality form to gain access, which was not possible over the weekend in a limited timeframe. And as the headband is becomes more widespread, we would have access to more EEG data that is specifically generated from Muse.In the short term, we could improve our mobile app to introduce another stakeholder. For instance, in cases of autistic children or psychiatric patients, it would be important to also develop a monitoring application on the guardian or caregiver side via a secure pathway.Also, we could integrate this technology to a smart-home environment. Based on the mood of the user, the physical environment could adapt spontaneously (lighting, music, etc.). In the long term, we envision that EEG sensors will improve significantly. This will allow for a device that is very low profile that is even more user-friendly, and has a higher sensitivity and accuracy.

', 'There are three main parts to this project:Framework used for automated running of unit tests and logging.Custom activity package that plays essential part in running of Framework and Unit Tests both.Unit Test Template used to easily make a Framework ready unit tests.FrameworkFramework automatically runs all unit tests present in the Test_Repository folder. For each test run, the Framework outputs test logs that can be used for debugging in case of a failed test or errors.It is made to be plug and play.No configuring is required.It can be seamlessly integrated into any project or framework.It automatically detects unit tests that hadn\'t implemented Assert Unit Test activity.Custom Activity PackageCustom activity package Custom.Activities.VariableComparer.x.x.x.nupkg contains custom code and activities used in both Framework and Unit Tests (for source code please check Custom Activity Repository).Custom activity package contains:Custom Assert class that contains various static methods used for evaluating outputs of the tested code:Assert.AreEqual(expected,actual) checks if two variables are equal.Assert.AreNotEqual(expected,actual) checks if two variables are not equal.Assert.AreSame(expected,actual) checks if two variables point to the same reference.Assert.AreNotSame(expected,actual) checks if two variables do not point to the same reference.Assert.Contains(expected,actual) checks if first variable is contained inside of second variable.Assert.NotContains(expected,actual) checks if first variable is not contained inside of second variable.Assert.IsNull(actual) checks variable is null.Assert.IsNotNull(actual) checks variable is not null.Custom Exceptions that are thrown by Assert methods and used by a Framework for logging:AssertException is main exception thrown by Assert methods.AssertNullException is exception thrown when Assert.IsNull or Assert.IsNotNull method returns false.CustomAssertException is generic exception that is thrown when random boolean expression that returns false is passed to Assert Unit Test activity.Custom Assert Unit Test activity used as container for writing Assert methods (used when making unit tests) and also by a Framework as a soft test validation (Framework checks if .xaml file in Tests_Repository folder is a real test or not by looking if it had implemented this activity). Unit Test TemplateFrom the developers standpoint, main effort needs to be put into the writing of the unit tests.Luckily, a master template for Unit Tests is supplied with the Framework to make this process quicker and easier.Along with the master template, a few examples are also supplied, and can be used as a start point for the developers not yet familiar with the unit tests.Unit Test Template is not mandatory to be used. Developers can make tests in their own way as long as Framework requirements are satisfied, meaning:Every test has to have implemented Assert Unit Test activity.In case these arguments are not present Framework is programmed to ignore the test and log it as an error.Quick GuideInstall custom activity package (Custom.Activities.VariableComparer.x.x.x.nupkg) that comes with the Framework and can be found in the root of the directory. Installation is performed by placing .nupkg package into the %localappdata%\\UiPath\\app-xx.x.x\\Packages folder and installing it using Package Manager from inside of UiPath.Using Unit Test template (Tests_Repository\\UnitTestTemplate\\MethodName_StateUnderTestExpectedBehavior.xaml_) make Unit Tests.Unit tests must implement Assert Unit Test custom activity to be eligible for running in Framework (is implemented by default in the template file).Place Unit Tests into the Tests_Repository folder.When RunAllTests.xaml is started it will run all tests that are found in the Tests_Repository folder.To integrate TestingFramework into another project copy whole folder to the target project root directory. (Optional) When integrating TestingFramework into another project, delete project.json file from TestingFramework folder (if present).(This is more of a quality of life improvement. For people that open .xaml from the directory itself. If you have integrated framework into another project, and you open RunAllTests.xaml directly from directory (while project.json is present in framework root) it will count TestingFramework as a standalone project and you will not be able to see parent project files inside of UiPath ""Project"" sidebar).

"Remi","If we can improve medication adherence, we can decrease hospitalization, physician visits, and lower healthcare costs","[3908, 'Yitaek went to Nepal after the devastating earthquake last April and saw that people couldn’t get access to hospitals because all of the roads were destroyed. Despite the terrible conditions, villagers even in the remotest regions were still able to use their phones to communicate. From this experience, he saw the potential of telemedicine via text messaging as a reliable mode of communication. Even in the US, most people prefer to get notifications over text messages compared to other mediums. Because we are constantly overflooded by huge amounts of information, we tend to miss little details. In the realm of healthcare, this applies to prescription adherence, which we often overlook as a non-issue. However, prescription nonadherence costs the medical industry $100 billions a year, despite being an easy issue to fix. So we decided to build Remi, the chatbot that reminds you to take your medication through a medium that you will actually use and is more reliable than the internet.  ', 'Remi is a chat bot programmed to remind you to take your medications and refill your prescriptions, answer questions about your prescriptions, and document your adherence behaviors.

"Phishing for Good (P4G)","An integrated software &amp; hardware platform that allows volunteers, fishers, researchers to report ghost fishing gear","[9595, 'We tackled Problem Statement #5: Ghost Gear. We identified with this problem as it is very applicable to Hong Kong waters. Hong Kong experiences an annual loss of $7.4 million through ghost fishing (2009 figures); the Hong Kong government has spent hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money yearly, since 1998, to hire external agents to clean up marine waste on its shores. Throughout the development phase, we tried to answer two questions:How do we identify ghost gear effectively?How do we trace ghost gear back to its origin?The solution we drew up, Phishing for Good (P4G), is an integrated software and hardware product that allows NGOs, volunteers, tourists and fishers to quickly and simply trace back a piece of ghost gear to its origin. Our smart IoT solution (smart gear tags) coupled with advanced technology (specifically image processing and machine learning) allows us to relatively accurately predict data, which we can then translate on a high-level onto a real-time heat map.Volunteers have an incentive to use our app, as the information input procedure is simplified and made intuitive. Local governments have the chance to engage in environmental conservation of their waters through utilizing our app. Large- and medium-sized fisheries are given the opportunity to engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and to claim increased profit, due to the decrease in the scale of ghost fishing - an unfortunate byproduct, among others, of ghost gear.Ultimately, our predictive technology allows stakeholders to identify what we call ghost gear “prone zones” across seas, improve awareness of potential ghost gear-related hazards and increase opportunities for timely gear retrieval.Phishing for Good (P4G) can address the suggestions made by the United Nations Food and Agriculture (UNFAO) by firstly seeking out partnerships with fishing gear manufacturers to deploy smart tags, then by liaising with local governments to encourage logging of ghost gear, both found and lost gear, through employing a “no-blame” policy. This is because we believe that aggregation of data deserves priority over penalizing of offenders.In this way, we believe that with the cooperation of relevant stakeholders, we have in our hands a valuable piece of technology that has the ability to maximize its potential in providing real impact to the fishing industry. ', 'There are three main functions: Report Found, Report Lost and My Gear. Under Report Found, perhaps the key functionality, the app user fills in four key entry fields, namely: location found; type of gear; sub-category of gear; and gear color. Once we are able to secure buy-in from gear manufacturers by way of deploying smart tags on fishing gear, we can utilize image processing using IBM Watson to enable one-step information input.Report Lost functions in a very similar manner. The My Gear functionality allows fishers and other stakeholders to keep easy track of their gear by registering gear details, or by logging the details of the smart tag.  The smart tag deployed on nets and other gear incorporate simple hardware: a low-cost accelerometer that complements our app. The tag, along with real-time data of ocean currents, allows us to map a probability model of where the gear was first lost and its likely trajectory. We can display this information on a heat map that serves as a visual representation of all the features of the app.These features allow fishers and other stakeholders to report both lost and found gear so that ghost gear hopefully spends minimal time in the ocean and also has a chance to be cleared away by clean-up agents. ', 'We built an Android application that allows divers and NGOs to report ghost fishing gear that they find. In order to facilitate the tracking of the smart tags which we incorporate in our idea, we created our own algorithm based on the Extended Kalman Filter with a gain which is regressed over various samples of traced paths through a Grid Long Short Term Memory network. The algorithm makes use of an Inertial Measurement Unit’s data integrated in terms of acceleration, and also cached forecasted water current data to gain a fairly accurate approximation of the smart tag’s position over time. The hardware prototype was made using an Arduino and MPU6050 IMU for the dead reckoning calculations. We also made a RESTful API for the backend using MongoDB and Deployd & hosted on Heroku. ', 'As our solutions integrates software with hardware, one of the main challenges was to come up with a solid vision of our technology. In order to build a reasonable model, we had to decide specifically the functionality of each component of our prototype, and figure out, how to make them feasible. In particular, we had to decide how to relate the mathematical model for predicting the possibility of having a particular piece of ghost gear in some area (heat map) to the software solution (platform) for reporting found items by volunteers and divers. In addition to that, we had to work out the value proposition of our solution for the users, the fisheries, and the government. Overall, the ideation process was the major challenge for our team. ', 'We are proud of our teamwork: both the tech and business parts were well analyzed, so we were able to differentiate ourselves from other teams in all aspects: from our tech slant approach to our pitching.It took some time for us to structure all the information in an interesting, pitch-friendly manner and to create a solution based on a complicated algorithm. However, as we allocated adequate resources to every challenge we aspired to solve, we were able to excel in all of our tasks. ', 'One of our major learnings was realizing and understanding real challenges faced by the fishery industry, specifically in Hong Kong. Below are a few points of note:Despite the number of awareness campaigns and programs, most people are still unaware of the long-term consequences of these issues.Interestingly enough, losing fishing gear can cause just as much harm as capturing too many fish.Ocean currents are strong enough to move cement blocks the size of a tank. Therefore, ghost gears are likely to end up in places that are far away from the point where it was lost – posing threat to rare aquatic species.A huge database does not necessarily mean it gives you what you are looking for. At the same time, look at data for long enough and you’ll probably find what you need. ', 'Phishing for Good (P4G) currently uses open source data collected from Adrift.org (for probability values of ocean current drifts at particular lat/long values) and earth.nullschool.net (for real time values). The future, as we see it, is to work around linking these data sets to improve the accuracy of our data model, as well as using image processing and machine learning techniques to further simplify the identification process.In terms of implementation of the product with fishing nets and getting fisheries/manufacturers involved, we are looking to appeal to the government as suggested by UNFAO (United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization) to bring about a regulation for all involved manufacturers to adopt the proposed technology.

"Pallete","Tongue controlled technology for SCI independence","[2953, ""Currently quadriplegics do not have a mobile, discreet method of finely controlling the technology used in their daily lives. We envision a tongue interface capable of controlling technology to enable more independent living. The tongue is one of the most sensitive and versatile muscles in the body, it is also concealed within the mouth. Though previous attempts of using the tongue as an interface for technology exist, none of them have succeeded in achieving a comfortable and lasting experience for the users while enabling control of multiple technologies.Specifically for our project we wish to create a tongue interface for mouse control and juxtapose it with those of existing enabling technologies. By achieving a strong tongue interface we can extrapolate control in future iterations to motorized wheelchair control, exoskeletons to regain use of limbs, and remote control of robotic arms to aid in daily tasks. Moreover, the increased interconnectivity expected to take place with the smart homes of the future and the trend of Internet of Things will bring about new solutions in accessibility for people with disabilities, when paired with our interface.How it worksFor this challenge we developed a functional prototype of our idea. The way it works is quite simple: a computer mouse that can be easily controlled with the tongue. Using the trackpoint provided, the user can move the cursor around, and by pressing the 2 buttons he can do left click and right click. By enabling this functionality, our interface enables its user to perform any task that an able-bodied person can perform using a conventional computer mouse.Challenges we ran intoTaking old laptop parts and adapting them into a small, simple, and easy to use device.Creating the form of the device to be fit inside the mouth.Creating the interface to control the mouse with the device.Accomplishments that we are proud ofAfter many hours of hard work we were able to connect the device to the computer and use it as a mouse.

"", 'Inspired by lackluster lectures and little to no interfacing time with professors, LectureBuddy allows students to signal their instructors with teaching concerns at the spot while also providing feedback to the instructor about the mood and sentiment of the class. By creating a web-based platform, instructors can create sessions from the familiarity of their smartphone or laptop. Students can then provide live feedback to their instructor by logging in with an appropriate session ID. At the same time, a camera intermittently analyzes the faces of students and provides the instructor with a live average-mood for the class. Students are also given a chat room for the session to discuss material and ask each other questions. At the end of the session, Lexalytics API is used to parse the chat room text and provides the instructor with the average tone of the conversations that took place.Another important use for LectureBuddy is an alternative to tedious USATs or other instructor evaluation forms. Currently, teacher evaluations are completed at the end of terms and students are frankly no longer interested in providing critiques as any change will not benefit them. LectureBuddy’s live feedback and student interactivity provides the instructor with consistent information.

"MyHealth","Beyond Patient Portal","[6933, ""We work with healthcare providers towards reaping benefit from smart devices right from strategy to its implementation. While working with several healthcare providers, we observed that they are mostly focused on EMR/EHR and patient health information management. On the other side of spectrum, there are lot of vendors who are providing generic  solutions for wellness.This is resulting in abundance of digital solutions however most of them are not fulfilling the need to having a healthy life. With myHealth we plan to take a holistic view of health and work with healthcare provider towards providing a unified view of people's health right from illness to wellness.Another market driver for this particular solution is towards penalty on patient readmission. With mobile becoming a virtual companion of life, we believe this solution as first step towards better quality of life by bringing ecosystem players including healthcare provider, family members, domain experts together under a single umbrella of myHealth. How it worksSome of fundamental thoughts that we are trying to address include:Peronsalization and Context awareness is key in today's work of content, data and applications. There is lot of opportunity published in terms of content, applications so in today's its important to provide access to what is relevant for user rather than serving generic content. Here's some key aspects considered in solution:User interface is based on age group of user. Fonts are big and specific instructions are there in user interface designed for elderly where as same application if someone starts in younger age group the user interface is verbose with medium size fonts.Application serves content based on user's health persona. It shows digital articles which are relevant to self or near and dear ones. So a 60 year old will get more content right from screening requirements which is relevant to his/hear health condition.Context Awareness - Pill reminders, procedures are aware about your location, time and activity you are performing so instead of reminding you of taking pill, user can configure it to remind when user is at home.Each individual has their own definition of healthy life: A 60 year old might want to different health goals compared to that of a 25 years old professional. Personalization makes it possible for all age groups to achieve their goals under one platform.Breaking Stereotype roles: Rather than attributing user with predefined roles like physician, patient, care provider, In this application we intent to consider user as persona playing multiple roles together. So a physician can also have his or her health profile and use this application as a step towards better health like any other user.Healthcare Providers are going to play a additional role of digital health adviser for staying healthy. Although with digital information becoming available  Patients are getting empowered however from a trust perspective, people do rely on their physician as a authority.

"Resistora","Image recognition resistance finder","[2923, ""For Sean and Neerajen's final project for their AP Physics C course, they had to build a digital seismograph. This project involved many Integrated Circuit chips, PCBs, and resistors. Lots of resistors.There were so many resistors in so many different values such that the progress on the seismoeter grinded to a halt. They had to consult a table every time to solder a resistor in. And they didn't finish the seismograph.But with an app that could tell them the value of the resistor, they would have been able to finish their project. So to prevent any future encounters with resistors, we as a team decided to make Resistora: the image recognition resistance finder.How it worksThe app's UI is quite simple. Open resistora, and align resistor with the two lines in the center of the app screen. Our manually overrided camera control algorithm will zoom in and take a picture for image processing and calculation, which will then be displayed at the bottom. Challenges I ran intoWorking with RGB and hue was very difficult. It is difficult for a computer to differentiate between colors such as Red, Orange, Brown, and Gold. As such, we tried multiple methods to identify the location of the colored bands on each resistor - such as Floodfill, normalizations, and transformations. Ultimately, we were able to find a way to identify the colors and its location using a graphing technique, and local maxima.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofWe used our knowledge from AP Physics to find an efficient solution to image processing. Firstly, each column was averaged. Then, the lightness and saturation were calculated from the image. One interesting thing we noted is that at each band on the resistor, the saturation value would spike. This would mean that all we would have to do is find the local maximas and then find the rgb values at those locations. However, this would occasionally produce false positives which were eliminated by using the lightness data. Whevener the lightness dropped, creating a local minima, this would indicate a band.

"A DID for every thing - Agile Driving Data Chain","Safer &amp; better mobility through verifiable, blockchain-enabled Driving Event Data Chains.","[20266, 'Driven by technology innovation and ecosystem growth mobility value chains are significantly changing from monolithic, closed to distributed, open systems.Data flows are dynamically defined and stretch across multiple entities. The trustworthiness and accuracy of output data of a distributed mobility value chain is of increasing importance for the safety within a mobility system. This transformation requires new concepts of digital identity and trust for data transactions among non-human entities.Introduction - What our solution doesOur MOBI grand challenge application presents a novel approach to establish verifiable data chains for driving event data processing. This enables the verification of a given data flow and the trustworthiness of output data. As the output data are used by several mobility control, risk and business systems it is important that any entity can evaluate the trustworthiness of a given output data set.The decentralized identifier (DID) is a new open standard type of globally unique identifier that offers a model for lifetime scope, portable digital identity that does not depend on any centralized authority and that can never be taken away by third parties. We are using DIDs as a standard identifier in our solution which is supported by the W3C community.Our approach uses cryptographic data structures to link data objects and to establish a method for data flow provenance [1]. By data flow provenance we mean a mechanism for tracing data item content and control through a processing system including any transformation to the data item. This includes flows with multiple sources, collective sensor fusion and processing by machine learning algorithms. Data flow provenance means not just tracing control but also verifying the end-to-end integrity of every data flow including any transformations (additions, deletions, modifications, combinations, and ML processing).When a DID and hence data chain of the resultant data is extended to machines, the provenance chain of the data flow can provide the basis for verifiable claims and attestations about the data flow itself as well as for reputation mechanisms. These novel verifiable data chains and reputation mechanisms allow to asses trustworthiness, reliability or risk metrics of a given output of a data chain.The applications of verifiable data chains stretch across multiple use cases including real-time vehicle value, agile driving, road and obstacle mapping, usage-based insurance (UBI), data market places, reliable feedback loops into driver assistance systems (DAS) and autonomous driving infrastructures, V2V/V2I interactions and cooperative mobility systems.Benefits of data provenance along a digitized value chain include:  reliability of data and ML labels in distributed systems  increased safety  maximized efficiency with less congestion, impact, costs and better services.Our verifiable data chain concept supports the MOBI goal of the first stage to demonstrate the pieces of the BC/DLT mobility puzzle that can be used and scaled today. We suggest evaluating our proposed data chain concept as a foundational technology for the future MOBI infrastructure.How we built itDecentralized identifiers (DIDs)The resulting combinatorics of possible connections between any given set of entities in a mobility system is an impossibly large number. Yet in today\'s user journeys or business environments, agents (whether human, machine, or software) increasingly need to communicate, access or transact with a diverse group of these interconnected entities to achieve their goals. This requires an interoperable and ubiquitous method to address, verify and connect these elements together.We propose to adopt the open decentralized identifier standard (DID) as an open, interoperable addressing standard and to establish mechanisms to resolve DIDs across multiple central or decentral mobility systems [2].DIDs are the atomic units of a new layer of decentralized identity infrastructure. DIDs can be extended from identifiers of people, to any entity, thus to identify every thing. We use DIDs to help identify and manage data sets, objects, machines or software agents through their digital twins, to locations, to events, and even to pure data objects.DIDs are derived from public private key pairs. We are using innovative cryptographic solutions for secure key management by fragmenting the private key of a DID that never exists in its entirety. Our key management solution is very effective for providing very secure signing transactions e.g. for smart phones, algorithms or data sets. An integration of the key management technology into embedded devices is on our technology roadmap.A DID has the following required syntax:did:method:idstringWe are using the Ethereum Blockchain and DID method ethr for our development work.did:ethr:0x5ed65343eda1c46566dff6774132830b2b821b35As our technology stack is blockchain agnostic any other DID method based on alternative blockchains can be integrated and used.Verifiable claimsDIDs are only the base layer of decentralized identity infrastructure. The next higher layer (where most of the value is unlocked), are verifiable claims [3,4]. This is the technical term for a digitally signed electronic data structure that conforms to the interoperability standards being developed by the W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group.Verifiable claims can be either self-issued by an entity such as a machine to provide a proof about authenticity and integrity of data or they can be issued by a third party (issuer, e.g. OEM, government, TÜV, service provider, bank).In mobility systems any entity might want to transact with any other entity. This means entities are engaging with each other in a dynamically defined, on-demand way. It is not pre-defined which entities interact among each other. To ensure efficient transactions any new entity in a mobility value chain must be able to independently verify other counter parties.To achieve this objective, we are using the DID approach and are anchoring the verifiable claims on a distributed ledger technology to move the cryptographic root of trust from central systems into a decentral, interoperable infrastructure.Digital twins that are verifiableA digital twin is a digital representation of a biological entity (human, living organism, organization), a physical entity (objects, machines), a digital entity (digital asset, software agent) or any system formed of any combination of individual entities.Digital twins can represent objects and entities as varied as a IoT sensors, ECUs, spare parts, vehicles, traffic lights, access gates, human users, or a city, and everything else in between. More recently they have started to be used to represent intangible entities like services, code, data, processes and knowledge. Digital twin data can consist of any life-cycle attributes and IoT sensor, telematics or compute data.A verifiable digital twin is a digital twin with attributes that are represented by verifiable claims. These attributes such as a birth certificate, authentication proof, a calibration report or sensor data attestations can be independently verified by any third party.This type of digital twin provides verifiable data about its creation, life-cycle, sensor readings, actuator commands or transactions. These verifiable data can be used for audit trails, decision making and for feedback loops in (autonomous) control systems.Verifiable driving event data chainA data chain is a cryptographic data structure that chains signed data objects together and establishes a method for data flow provenance. Data flow provenance allows verifying the end-to-end integrity of every data flow object and its transformations (additions, deletions, modifications, combinations, and machine learning processing).Processing of driving event data is operational in multiple mobility disciplines. Driving event data processing can include multiple data sources, parties, algorithms and processing steps. A human or non-human end-user of driving event data chains needs to be able to validate trustworthiness and accuracy of data chain output data. This requirement becomes of critical importance when the output data is used in safety or security relevant use cases or to make economic decision with significant commercial values involved.For establishing a verifiable data chain, we link signed objects together. The following code snippet is a payload example with a machine learning label (red traffic light), information about the algorithm that created the label (Algorithm 1) and a link to the previous data chain block (previous block ID).HEADER: PAYLOAD TOKEN TYPE & SIGNATURE ALGORITHM{""typ"": ""JWT"",""alg"": ""ES256K-R""}PAYLOAD: DATA{  {  ""iat"": 1546724123,  ""exp"": 1546810523,  ""signer"": {    ""type"": ""algorithm"",    ""name"": ""Algorithm 1""  },  ""data"": {    ""claim"": {      ""predictionLabel"": ""red traffic light, red traffic signal, stoplight"",      ""predictionProb"": ""0.983483"",      ""did"": ""did:ethr:0xe405b9ecb83582e4edc546ba27867ee6f46a940d""    },    ""previousBlockId"": ""b86d95d0-1131-11e9-982e-51c29ca1f26e"",    ""previousBlockHash"": ""307b817de9b7175db0ded0ea9576027efd64fb21""  },  ""iss"": ""did:ethr:0x5ed65343eda1c46566dff6774132830b2b821b35""}The data chain object can be verified by validating the signature of the payload. Cryptographic data chains enable users to validate the provenance of entire driving event data processing chains including the authenticity and integrity of the input data, the output data and the provenance of sensing devices and the processing algorithms.We recommend to  establish verifiable data chains for driving event data processing,  provide a DID for every entity and data set,  integrate the data chains with DID registries (e.g. validated list of OEMs).The verifiable digital twins are addressable by their DIDs and providing information about organizations, sensors telematics devices, data sets, external data sources, software algorithms and users involved in the data chain.This approach is of particular value when validation or benchmarking data are available about the sensing devices, vehicles and the algorithms that are processing the driving event data. In combination with a reputation or validation system any user can calculate trustworthiness and accuracy metrics about the output data. For instance, data with provenance will have a much higher commercial value on a data market place.As a next step, reputation methods can be integrated for both, individual digital twins and entire data chains. Further standardization work on data chain trustworthiness and accuracy metrics need to be done.Design principlesFor our digital twin and data chain integration work we are applying the following design principles:PrincipleDescriptionFrom VINs to value chainsAbstracting the Concept of Identity to a mobility system of vehicles, IoT, road & travel infrastructure, mobility systems, ML agents, driving event data set, autonomous driving/DAS feedback loops, markets and humans. Exchanging data among those entities. E2E data provenance along a value chain.Blockchain-agnosticUse blockchain for anchoring attestations or verifiable claims. Decision on which blockchain to anchor claims based on user preferences or economic metrics such as Tx costs. Use of fiat-backed stable coins for micropayments.Scalable integrationIntegrated technology stack consisting of off-chain data structures, serverless cloud infrastructure, secure key management, DIDs, ML agents, sensor data, data chain fusion and blockchain connectors.Responsibility SegregationImplementation of this common pattern for micro services design that supports scalability and maintainability of our solution.StandardsUse of existing W3C, Industry 4.0 and Automotive data standards and semantic models to ensure adaptability and portability of our solution.Business valueFocusing on simple data integrity and authenticity problems within existing value chains. Retrofitting of existing infrastructures to scale adoption.Agile driving event data chain for MOBI grand challengeAgile driving events can be divided into two groups: (1) the interaction between a driver’s vehicle and the road environment, and (2) the interaction between a driver’s vehicle and nearby vehicles [5].Diverse methods for enhancing driving safety have been proposed. Such methods can be roughly classified as passive or active. Passive methods (e.g., seat-belts, airbags, and anti-lock braking systems), which have significantly reduced traffic fatalities, were originally introduced to diminish the degree of injury from an accident. By contrast, active methods are designed to prevent accidents from occurring. Driver assistance systems (DAS) are designed to alert the driver - or an autonomous driving module - as quickly as possible to a potentially dangerous situation.The two classes of driving events may occur simultaneously and lead to certain serious traffic situations. Automotive industry is working on active methods and systems including machine learning algorithms to analyze these two kinds of events and determine dangerous situations in agile driving from data collected by various sensors and data from external sources. The machine learning output labels about dangerous curves, road obstacles or poor vehicle conditions are fed into control, transaction and risk systems. In distributed mobility systems the trustworthiness and accuracy of the output labels must be independently verifiable.Key question: How can I trust vehicle identity data, 3rd party data and machine learning labels that are created and processed along a distributed mobility value chain?To achieve trustworthiness of output labels we are planning to blend our verifiable data chain technology with historic driving event data and black box algorithms to build a verifiable driving event solution:  Interoperable decentral identity and verifiable digital twinning protocol  Cryptographically secured and blockchain-enabled data chains  E2E integration of remote sensing (telematics) data and machine learning algorithmsOur approach demonstrates how the following trust problems can be addressed with DLT:  Vehicle provenance and configuration  Provenance, verifiability and integrity of the driving event input data (or telematics data)  Integrity and transparency of driving event data chain when multiple 3rd party intermediaries are involved  Credentials about benchmarking of ML algorithms and training data  Aggregated accuracy and trustworthiness of predicted ML labels and attributesChallenges we ran intoOver the course of the implementation of our verifiable data chain we ran into the following challenges: Providing DID identity to individual data sets and algorithms No reference implementations for verifiable data chains No common semantic standards for automotive digital twin Lack of validated source code for scalable issuing and anchoring of verifiable claims (>100.000 Tx/s) Getting access to sensible OEM driving event data and real algorithms Lack of E2E driving event data models and architectures (location, transport, events, processing)We solved (1.) and (2.) with our data chain implementation.

We are planning to benchmark the protocol in the next weeks.We are trying to address (5.) with BMW.  Data model implementation patterns need to be created in order to enable effective implementation of cyber physical systems (CPS). This is a general task to be done regardless of the use of DLT technology. To address (6.) we are working with the German Centre of Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) on a CPS integration methodology, a data modelling methodology and reusable data model implementation patterns for verifiable data chains.Accomplishments that we are proud ofWe accomplished the development of verifiable data chains including the following technology components:  DID manager  Secure key management  HD identity wallet  Verifiable claims  Deployment on severless cloud functions on AWS  Integration of tensor flow algorithms for image processingWe are now planning to integrate historic agile driving event data from an OEM and a black box algorithm with our existing data chain solution on Amazon Web Services.What we learnedOur primary leanings are around the following areas of interest:  Abstraction of the DID method to any object  Identity solutions for machine learning agents  Scalability of off-chain data structures  Integration of serverless cloud infrastructure with key management and identity wallets  Verifiability of data chains  Applicability of data chains for above mentioned data-driven business solutionsWhat\'s next: our broader objectiveOur broader objective is to establish a scalable digital twin protocol and a technology layer for autonomous things.

We finally decided on a minimum viable product of having locations, and ways to move between them. This was fairly simple to code and we moved on from there.Originally, we used JSON as the base of AdvLang but we quickly realised JSON syntax was not really great for what we were trying to achieve. After trying several different approaches, parser generators, and our own recursive descent parsers, we finally settled on our current approach, which we think maximises simplicity and readability.Getting curses to do the ""right"" thing was a pretty long process. We originally had the user type in their choices, like a proper adventure game, but decided that offering a menu of choices would improve the experience. Little did we realise how much work there\'d be to get a menu working inside a terminal! ', ""We're super proud to have a working engine!

"", 'KISS - ""keep it simple, stupid"". We really were way too ambitious at the beginning. Once we started working on our ""minimum viable product"", we started making progress really quickly. From there, it was much easier to extend our project to include the majority of features that we originally hoped for. ', ""We're actually planning to continue work on this after the hackathon. Firstly, we're really close to adding ASCII art and centering the output to make the interface nicer. We're also planning to create a proper (web-based) GUI for writing and playing adventures, to make it even easier for beginners to get started with AdvLang.

"NESS","An innovative system to prevent wasting water in almost any environment. Now with IoT functions","[3630, ""The idea of NESS was born in 2014, when we realized everybody hates leaving the tap open while waiting for hot water. Sure, there were some solutions, but most of them implied wasting huge amounts of energy and/or money (Resistor Heaters. additional heaters near the shower, additional recirculation pipes). That's why we created NESS. "", ""To put it simply, it saves water. And a lot of it. NESS is composed by 3 modules: A pumping module, a bypass module and an activator module. Installing the pumpling module next to the heater, and the bypass module on the furthest place of the hot water pipe, we can save ~200 gallons per household each month. Just activate the system before using the hot water, It'll move all that cold water that's stuck in the hot water pipe (the water everybody usually let go down the drain) back to the heater, while bringing hot water to any place in your home. Water will stay warm for about 20 minutes, so you have plenty of time to have a coffee or do your thing before having a shower.How does it fit in the Challenge?It's easy to get into Ness, in less than an hour you can have the system installed and working.It doesn't have any negative impact for the user. It's better to activate the system a minute before going into the shower than getting cold because of all the water you're letting down the drain.If every household in California had it, we could be saving ~81million gallons. Now, that's a lot.There isn't a lot of data of hot water usage, it's about time to fix that. We can gather a lot of data about user tendencies and installations that will help us to save even more water.This is replicable almost anywhere in the Earth. Every house with a water pipe for cold water, one for hot water and a heater can work with Ness. "", ""We started building it in late 2014, earning a lot of recognition from the University of Malaga and some other public entities. By the beginning of 2015, we had a functional prototype, and that's when we saw the Makers Against Drought announcement. We decided to give it a try and turn NESS into the IoT device we always wanted it to be. "", 'As usual with startups, money has been our biggest hurdle. We had the passion, we had the ability to create something useful, but we had little money. We could solve it by doing some other projects for other people, and while that has been fun too, it has provided us the money we needed to build this system.

"Lung Cancer Detection using Deep Learning","Pioneer lung cancer diagnosis tool. Upload CT scans &amp; get accurate cancer nodules diagnosis within minutes.","[5482, 'We identified the lung cancer is one of the most critical diseases, for the chance that a man will develop lung cancer in his lifetime is about 1 in 14 and for a woman, 1 in 17. It is crucial to detect cancer at early stage to ensure timely treatment and increase survival rates.    However, the diagnosis process is time-consuming and prohibitive, which hinders people for actively monitoring their health conditions. Furthermore, the manpower cost to hire a specialist for hospitals is costly in terms of both time and finance, with an extensive training required.    After exploring the elegance of machine learning, we believe that the deep learning methodology can contribute largely towards this pressuring issue. Within 2 days, we built LCD, an innovate deep learning tool dedicated to lung cancer diagnosis.     ', 'LCD accelerates the detection process for lung cancer. Users can simply upload CT scans to LCD website and get the diagnosis results within minutes. It not only detects potential cancer nodules, but also eliminates false positive nodules to ensure higher accuracy.    ', 'We trained the image segmentation model using neural networks, specifically, U-Net. Then we use the Residual Networks to eliminate the false positive samples. We trained the neural networks with Tensorflow framework. The model is running interactively on a GPU server. A web app is built with Python Flask framework that allows users to have minimum trouble of getting diagnosis immediately.     ', ""Time constraint for deep learning is beyond our expectation. Usually, it takes 2 weeks to train a fully functioning LCD, but we do not have the luxury of time to make a complex and sophisticated LCD from scratch within 2 days. It's depressing to realize that the sophisticated version that coders have spent the entire first-day writing might not be able to implement completely. However, we made some necessary adjustments and manage to present the first version within 48 hours.    "", ""ProductWe are proud to build a product with strong future applications and positive implications towards the society. Deep learning for cancer detection is such a fascinating field that illustrates the combination of two seemingly irrelevant areas. NYU has taught us the importance of critical thinking and cross-thinking, and we are grateful for the analytical skills as well as technical skills we manage to gain and apply. We will definitely continue exploring the field, building a version beyond the current Hackathon and bringing some positive changes to the society.   TechnologyWe have learned more about deep learning, in terms of structure and applications. The experiential learning experience enables us to apply what we're taught in school, mentors and workshops provide us with more timely advice on the product and the time constraint pushes us beyond our comfort zone (and procrastination).   TeamworkThe most importance accomplishment in the journey is the great teamwork. We literally formed the team 10min before the official start of the hackathon, and are presently surprised that we complement each other in terms of skill sets. As a three-man team, we worked coherently -Yichen did the complex algorithm, Shining built the website and user interface, and Yamei wrote the content. Although our team is smaller, we are proud that we made new friends and built LCD together within the past 2 days.   "", ""Manage your expectations and stay realistic.The first lesson is to manage your expectations realistically. Within the short duration, it is nearly impossible to achieve a final design for a tool that normally takes weeks to finish. However, going through the thinking process for the sophisticated algorithm made us optimistic about the future of LCD, and would love to continue working on it. It's good that we tried.   Persistence is the key. There are struggles and challenges, actually much more that we thought. Staying optimistic, making necessary adjustments and never giving up are the critical steps we've learned, not only for hackathons or coding but also for everything we do in life.  Enjoy the process.Doing things we love and learning new things along the way are simply amazing! The struggles we went through, the pizzas we shared and the product we built eventually are an amazing learning experience and we will do it again.    "", ""We are going to upgrade the current product and enhance the accuracy of diagnosis. We will continue research and lab experiments in NYU, consult NYU professors and mentors for future developmentMoving on, we will conduct further analysis on the market potential, competitors and industry outlook for the sector.

"MyMusicMate","Friendly chatbot that helps you and your friends find a concert to go together based on your collective music tastes!","[10669, '""So, guys, we know we all want to go to a concert somewhere, but there are just so many options to choose from!""""Yeah, and it\'s especially difficult because we have such varying tastes.""""If only there were some sort of chatbot that could take our musical preferences and somehow convert them into concert options for us…""""Wouldn\'t that be great? And imagine if the power of Amazon Lex was used to control its conversation logic!""Does this conversation sound familiar to you? Well it should now, because you just read it a moment ago. Our concert-loving group of developers wanted to create a chatbot that would not only give users concert recommendations based on their music interests, whether they be by artist or by genre, but would also help them decide as a group which concert to go to. We\'ll even throw in some live concert videos from YouTube to help them decide! ', ""MyMusicMate starts by rounding up your concert-loving friends into a Slack channel and asking about everyone's music tastes.  Folks can name artists they like, or they can simply name genres if they don't have any specific artists in mind. MyMusicMate leverages the LastFM API to help get artist recommendations based off of user input, and then asks users to specify where they're interested in going to a concert.  For now, MyMusicMate only focuses on cities within the US, but it's learning more with every passing day/commit ;)MyMusicMate then takes this information and uses the BandsInTown Concert Search API to find upcoming events and the YouTube Search API to find live concert videos to help users make their decision.  If you're unsure about whether or not you'd like to see an artist in person, maybe a video of a live concert could help!Finally, MyMusicMate takes the list of concert results and concert videos and displays them in the Slack channel, allowing users to mull their decision over and place a vote for which concert the group should go to.  And don't worry - if your group can't agree on a concert, MyMusicMate will be happy to offer new suggestions or get new musical preferences until it can find what's right for you! "", ""At its core, MyMusicMate is a Slack chatbot powered by Amazon Lex for its conversation logic. Lex intents are used to guide the user into inviting friends into a new Slack channel, gather everyone's musical tastes, and enter a location so MyMusicMate can start searching for concerts.  After the initial intent is triggered by a sample utterance, flow from intent to intent is handled by Amazon Lambda functions until concert voting is ready to begin. Once voting is complete, the application will either terminate if a success condition is met, or trigger a previous intent to gather more information from users.Our Lambda functions also use Amazon's Simple Notification Service to queue actions, post messages to Slack, and communicate with Lex without fear of any function timeouts.  Lambda functions are also used for Slack integration, aiding in app installation, event subscription, and handling of interactive messages (voting) routed through Amazon API Gateway endpoints.DynamoDB tables are used to store data that must persist through the application flow (artists, genres, concerts, etc.) and beyond (user IDs, team IDs, access tokens, etc.). Artists and genres are discarded when users have exhausted their concert options and decide to expand their search preferences, while concerts are kept until the application terminates, in order to ensure duplicate recommendations are not delivered. State (current intent, channel id, timeout) and current intent data (callback_IDs, user input) are also stored, allowing multiple users to converse with Lex freely without fear of accidentally invoking other intents.MyMusicMate leverages multiple APIs to validate user input and find events for users. The LastFM Album Search API is used to get related artists by genre, while the BandsInTown Artist and Concert Search APIs are used to verify artist names, US city names, and search for concerts by specified and related artists.  Finally, the YouTube Search API is used to search for live concert videos, after which all of the content is rolled up and passed to the Slack messaging API in neatly formatted messages.Our team used the Serverless Framework to build and deploy our application onto the AWS stack.  During deployment, we retrieve s3 bucket information from CloudFormation and upload our redirect page and images of the MyMusicMate family accordingly.  One of our developers also created a plug-in for the Serverless framework to deploy our Lex bot from a blueprint file, which is hopefully available as a npm package by the time you read this :) "", 'Our team ran into a number of challenges during development. Being a newly available technology, references were sparse so we were not able to find the exact behavior of some of Amazon Lex slot types, which led to some guesses on how user input would be interpreted. Creating a Lex intent loop was also a bit harder than expected, and we wound up using a continuous ConfirmIntent loop with multiple optional Slot Types as a bit of a hack.  As a result, we had to perform additional user input validation to ensure Lex wasn\'t registering a ""negative"" sounding artist name as a ""status denied"" confirmation, as was the case for the DJ name ""What So Not"" for example. Creating a proper timer also proved to be an issue, as we wanted to give the user an option to extend the timer while being mindful of Lex timeouts.  We eventually decided on storing the time with the rest of the ""state"" information, which allowed us to restore state without worry of intent expiration.Prioritizing concerts was also a hurdle, as we had to factor in the nature of the search result (whether it was by related artist, by genre, etc.), whether or not there was any artist overlap with previously displayed events, and whether or not the event received a certain percentage of votes in a previous round of voting.If you plan on terminating a voting process after the last vote is placed, leave a bit of a buffer for misclicks and changed opinions. People love to change their mind after a vote has been placed. ', 'First and foremost, we are proud of putting together an application that leverages a number of technologies that we had never used before (Lex, DynamoDB, Slack API, Lambda) in a short period of time.  We\'ve grown as developers, and some would say, as people. *cue awws from the audience*We were also proud of how we implemented state management with DynamoDB, storing interim event data to allow us to reliably poll users for input inside or outside of intents without accidentally invoking another intent or triggering a Lambda function.  Once we were able to control state flow, we didn\'t have to worry about how making our Lex interactions less ""bot-like"" might affect MyMusicMate\'s behavior.We\'re also pretty happy with our concert queue/voting logic.  Ultimately we wanted to give users the highest chance of coming to an agreement on which concert to go to, and this meant giving enough of a variety of concerts, setting the proper threshold for keeping or discarding events, and allowing just enough rounds of voting necessary to make a refined decision without getting stuck in a voting loop. ', 'Double-verify user input. Even if you using a pre-existing Amazon Slot type, stick a Lambda verification function behind it.Print long, print strong. If you\'re going to be manually controlling Lex intent flow, you\'ll be looking at event contents constantly.  Like, never comment out a print event statement. Ever.Be human. Writing multiple, informal intent utterances and response messages can go a long way in making bot interactions seem more ""human,"" while repeated responses or responses in ALL CAPS can result in a colder, more jarring experience for the user.People make mistakes. If you plan on terminating a voting process after the last vote is placed, leave a bit of a buffer for misclicks and changed opinions. People love to change their mind after a vote has been placed. ', 'Expand concert search.  We\'d like to accomplish this in two ways: First, we want to leverage other event search APIs, such as Songkick and Eventful, so MyMusicMate would have a greater library of concerts to parse through.  Second, we\'d like to expand support for cities outside of the US, starting with the rest of North America.Fuzzy search and related genres.  We\'d like to implement fuzzy searching to allow for more accurate resolution of misspelled genres and artist names, as well as a ""related genre"" search to be used when the current search scheme does not return a sufficient number of events.Headless browser to unfurl redirected content.  Our current ticket links contain a JavaScript redirect to each event\'s respective ticketing page.  We will use a headless browser to grab the redirect link so metadata can be unfurled inside the final Slack message.Amazon Polly Integration. . We originally planned on integrating Polly with MyMusicMate, to allow for seamless concert recommendations based on users talking to each other about their musical preferences.  Unfortunately we didn\'t have enough time to accomplish this, but we would love to revisit this idea in the future.Smarter YouTube searches.  We\'d like to redefine our YouTube search to prioritize videos from Artists\' official Vevo pages and use the YouTube Music Insights API to prioritize videos based on popularity by location, depending on the user\'s city.

"CloudIoT","All your things on the cloud","[5928, ""My first motivation was to learn meteor; create a second application. My first application is an attempt to recreate billpin which seems to be going into decay, I've publish this first app a while ago at: http://billbuz.com/.Internet of Things have been a popular topic lately and we are seeing many applications being create to monitor data streams. Since I've always been a fan of home automation and as a side hobby I build my wireless arduino sensors, I wanted to be able to track them in a convenient way. I have few Arduino with nRF24L01 and sensors which are battery powered around the house. "", ""I have few Arduino with wireless nRF24L01 which communicate using the NRF24Mesh libray (which allow routing the data through other mesh nodes) to a mesh server currently running on a Raspberry Pi. This RPI communicate to the Meteor server using C++/DDP to feed the data from all its sensors on the mesh network. Where the hackathon come in is for the the meteor part. The meteor server listen for devices feed from DDP protocol. Those feed come from any source as long as they respect the app high level RPC protocol. Then it store information about the sensors into mongo which allows clients to visualize it. It manage user sessions to allow modifying the feeds metadata that your user own.We use the userId and private key on external applications or RPI to feed the data. This is required in order to have a user owning the feed.On the client side we can see the sensors and it's data in charts. All chars are update realtime from the sensors data. Only a subset of the data is sent to the client to minimize the transfert between the server and client. For instance, when activating a feed, a subscription is made for that particular feed and providing the last X element of the collection. "", 'In this hackathon I\'ve worked only on the meteor part so I\'ll skip the C++ DDP impl and RPI/arduino communication.To prevent from having to build everything from scratch, I\'ve used as many packages as I could that would save me some time.To quickly create the UI, I\'ve looked around at other web site source HTML and CSS to ""inspire"" my design from them. To create the picture on the login page, I\'ve took a picture of the RPI with an Adruino.I\'ve done the routing with iron:router and read the tutorial which explains how to wait for data to be fully loaded before changing page, and also to have a loading screen while the initial first load.Chartist-js is an good chart package to visualize the data. It\'s been easy to integrate, but it was a bit harder to customize the way I exactly wanted it. Next time I\'ll try chart.js.Many thanks to the Meteor Toys which accelerated my development a lot. For sure I\'m going to buy it. ', ""I'm a beginer on Meteor, I've only published one app with this framework. Also, I'm not a web programmer in my full time job, I work as a game programmer on PC and console games. This lead me to time loss such as  re-reading some basic meteor stuff such as the rounting part using iron:router. Simply having a correct Html/Css layout took some precious time.Also since my artistic talent leaves much to be desired, I could not create my own textures. I had to find free textures online but ran into packages to help me such as bootstrap & FontAwesome. While designing the second page where we see graph, I lost time trying to figure out how to show the data and what I actually wanted as a final result.The usual issue, I wanted to do more than I could so I ended up with a partial application and no sleep in that 24 hour.At some point I had issue between the RPI communicating with the meteor server. I didn't want to spent time on that part in the hackathon but I had to in order to have working feeds. "", ""I managed to get the data from my Arduino sensors, to my RPI, then to my meteor server and show the sensor feeds into charts. I wasn't sure I could get there in time, but my best friend google helped me out a lot to learn the pieces I was missing on meteor/javascript/etc.Also I load only the feed data on demand so there is not a huge initial transfer.I'm not too sad about the look of the app, the login screen look good, and the feed screen is okay. Lacking functionality though. "", ""With meteor I can deliver prototypes very quickly. I don't see how I would have done it using any other framework.I've also learn some meteor basics which i didn't assimilate completly while doing my first app. "", ""I want to tweak sensors variables from the meteor web interface. It's tedious to modify the code and reupload it to aduinos each time I want to try a new values.I want to have only the owner who can see its feed. He could then share a view or a feed with someone else as he wants.I would like to have a more customizable dashboard, we decide which feed to see and in which graph we'll visualize the data.I would also like to have alert based on certain data values, and send email of sms depending on preferences.Adding a new client to feed data is not user friendly right now, I want to have this part made easier.Run your own serverThis is actually not a good idea at this point since you need your own sensors that respond to the high level RPC protocol.

"CoSine","The beautiful re-plastering of a mathematical concept into a fast paced 2d platformer. A true test of co-ordination.","[4125, 'To me there was a certain beauty to graphs - I know that sounds odd and geeky but it seemed so strange that something mathematical was in fact so in grained in our physical world. Taking this concept of waves and dynamics, it wasn\'t a stretch to create game where controlling those dynamics were the key to survival. The game:The game focuses around two waves:  i.e you. You have two possible ways of controlling them, moving them up and down; or moving them further or closer together.  You\'re objective survive. Obstacles head your way getting progressively harder and more challenging, but there are a few power-ups to help you out. As the difficulty increases and the obstacles getting harder to predict, it becomes more and more necessary to use both controls in tandem; truly testing co-ordination and reactions.How I built itThe main framework I used was SpriteKit - Apple\'s own 2d engine. I found it to be intuitive and straight-forward, making it easier to focus on the logic and maths to set up this mathematical phenomenon ;). The UI was pre-sketched in Sketch, a brilliant design tool I found to truly see how the final product would look, but I think most of all the vector drawing made the quality of the images brilliant, considering I opted for a clean, minimalist geometric style. The music was made through Garageband, and though it may not be the focus of the game it proved an adequate backing to the game. Challenges I ran intoThe main challenge on the coding front was setting up the sin wave, and making it adjustable; but more-so in a good bullet-proof system that decreased the chances of bugs and gave the user a beautiful experience. But, also I think what was harder was creating a perfect alignment system so that the spikes always aligned with the max amplitude of the wave regardless of the global step or the fps changes. But on the UI and UX front, though I got the initial idea and concept nailed out quickly actually making that happen proved quite the challenge: creating the icons, assets and most importantly colour schemes :D - it got quite tedious. The tutorial and ironing out the learning curve of the game to make it enjoyable was also very difficult. The tutorial had to be more ""walk-in"" and interactive to truly show the concept, but the passing of the game had to be right when they began. This however more challenging when people who playing the game for a while said the start became boring since it was too easy. The dilemma I still don\'t know if I have solved!Accomplishments that I\'m proud ofAs my first real project and product, I think it was a very good step. I think I was able to take a concept and deliver it into a professional looking app (I hope...). The idea I felt was novel and I think definitely was my eye-opener into app development and then I think to computer science in general. Overall, I think my proudest aspect would be the look of the game, in my opinion, it is beautiful and especially on the right device; and I feel it is a true product.What I learnedI learned a lot. In coding the most: just realising the worst method possible, was a huge improvement for me. It truly turned my attention to ""efficient beautiful"" code. However I am still shaky on being able to comment regularly, having a good naming system...But on practical aspects, I learnt the nuances and intricacies of iOS app submission: the horror of screenshot and app previews and icons. How multi-device support should be considered when the app is first built - not at the last minute. Not to leave the FPS count on in a final build ...It was truly a journey.What\'s next for CoSineI would like to expand the assets and maybe add a few game-modes. And maybe team up with other people to truly make it better in ways that I probably cannot see.

"", 'The main challenge on the coding front was setting up the sin wave, and making it adjustable; but more-so in a good bullet-proof system that decreased the chances of bugs and gave the user a beautiful experience. But, also I think what was harder was creating a perfect alignment system so that the spikes always aligned with the max amplitude of the wave regardless of the global step or the fps changes. But on the UI and UX front, though I got the initial idea and concept nailed out quickly actually making that happen proved quite the challenge: creating the icons, assets and most importantly colour schemes :D - it got quite tedious. The tutorial and ironing out the learning curve of the game to make it enjoyable was also very difficult. The tutorial had to be more ""walk-in"" and interactive to truly show the concept, but the passing of the game had to be right when they began. This however more challenging when people who playing the game for a while said the start became boring since it was too easy. The dilemma I still don\'t know if I have solved! ', 'As my first real project and product, I think it was a very good step. I think I was able to take a concept and deliver it into a professional looking app (I hope...). The idea I felt was novel and I think definitely was my eye-opener into app development and then I think to computer science in general. Overall, I think my proudest aspect would be the look of the game, in my opinion, it is beautiful and especially on the right device; and I feel it is a true product. ', 'I learned a lot. In coding the most: just realising the worst method possible, was a huge improvement for me. It truly turned my attention to ""efficient beautiful"" code. However I am still shaky on being able to comment regularly, having a good naming system...But on practical aspects, I learnt the nuances and intricacies of iOS app submission: the horror of screenshot and app previews and icons. How multi-device support should be considered when the app is first built - not at the last minute. Not to leave the FPS count on in a final build ...It was truly a journey. ', 'I would like to expand the assets and maybe add a few game-modes. And maybe team up with other people to truly make it better in ways that I probably cannot see.

"VeriRoute","Rates different routes from a source to destination  on a safety scale of 1 to 5 ","[4233, ' ', 'VeriRoute is a unique transportation application that allows users to not only identify the quickest path to their destination, but also various safety metrics that characterize each route. When their route is selected, we utilize EverQuote’s anonymous database which characterize various dangerous behaviors, such as phone usage, speeding, acceleration, and braking, along the latitude and longitude locations that characterize their route. We utilize data that represents the frequency of crime-related incidents along the route as well, and compile all of these metrics to provide a subjective, weighted score to depict the safety of each route. The aim is to provide users, particularly those unfamiliar with the areas they are venturing into, with an added measure of security.  ', ""We obtained a database from EverQuote, which contained data over a period of time that identified when people at each specific latitude and longitude location were either speeding, accelerating, using their phone, or braking. Each of these points were anonymous, and we used JavaScript to parse this data file to both obtain points within a 0.5 mile radius along the route, and applied a subjective weighting system to characterize the score based on the density of each of the four events described above. We then overlapped crime data in the same fashion, and applied a final score based on this data.Challenges We Ran Into:A major challenge we ran into that limited the reliability and capability of the application was the limited amount of data we had to work with. This made it difficult to scale our idea, since we only had a limited batch of locations and a limited time frame in which the data was collected. Another major limitation we ran into was the lack of immediate availability of comprehensive crime data. Much of this data was gathered in or around metropolitan areas, so the scope in which we could extrapolate results was severely diminished. This also offered a scalability challenge, since the scores would be skewed unfairly if the route took an individual through a major city. Accomplishments that we're proud of:We were thrilled to get the application up and running at the level it is at. Two of our team members were first-time hackathon participants, so there was a lot of explanation and instruction along with writing code and fleshing out the idea.

"AutiBot","AutiBot is a health hack capable of analyzing brain activity to detect young children's risk for developing autism.","[4746, 'Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a range of neurological development disorders including Asperger’s Syndrome and autism that affect approximately 1 in 50 American children. Although the onset of these disorders typically occurs before children are three years old, current methods to diagnose ASD at very early ages are often ineffective, depending on the observation of certain distinctive mannerisms (such as inability to make eye contact) that may not be detected or associated with ASD. Recent research studies, however, have indicated that EEGs can offer a better, more scientific diagnosis of ASD. When children are faced with the task of integrating several different visual and audial stimuli, autistic children experience significantly reduced brain activity because of their inability to quickly process these stimuli. We were inspired by the massive potential of this new technology to make the cheapest possible EEG-based ASD-detection hack. Our goal was to create a multi-sensory game integrating many different types of stimuli, such as color, shape, and sound, to determine children’s chances of developing ASD. ', 'Our hack, AutiBot, is a simple, accessible game that tests the response of young children to several different visual and auditory stimuli at once by asking them to tap certain dots on the screen. While teaching children about color, shape, number, and more, it also records the time taken by the user to respond to the stimuli and values for the EEG brain activity of the user using the Muse headband technology. Then, by running an Anomaly Prediction machine learning model based on pre-existing datasets of non-autistic , the app calculates the probability of the user developing a mental disease like Autism. The app also has features to store and display the user’s results over time in the form of graphs and recommend actions to the child’s family, like contacting a local doctor, based on the results of the autism-prediction machine learning model. ', 'We built the game in iOS using Swift. We used Microsoft Azure to create the predictive machine learning model which analyzes the cumulative data (EEG and reaction times, stored in a Parse backend) from each user and predicts the probability of developing ASD. For reading data on brain activity, we used the Muse headband technology and the LibMuse SDK.  ', 'Getting the Muse headband to work was the biggest challenge we ran into. The LibMuse SDK had no support for Swift, so we had to create bridging headers to integrate our Objective-C Muse code with the rest of the app, written in Swift, which ended up being far more difficult than we initially thought. Moreover, pairing the Muse headband to our laptops through Bluetooth was extremely challenging, which also negatively affected our ability to obtain the datasets for the Azure machine learning model. ', 'Actually finishing the hack despite the hurdles with Muse. Also, we were very happy with the UI design and the overall concept/social application of the hack. ', 'We learned how machine learning can be utilized to detect anomalies in data sets.

"Cash Only","Avoid ATM Fees with Peer-to-Peer Cash","[2269, 'You\'ve been waiting in line to get into your favorite bar for half an hour when you hear a murmur that they\'re charging $5 for cover, and only accepting cash.  Sighing, you look in your wallet, but as usual you only find cards and receipts.  You don\'t want to lose your spot, but the only ATM at the bar charges ridiculous service fees.  Ugh.With Cash Only, this is no longer a problem.  You simply pull up the app, request the cash you need, and you\'ll be matched with a nearby member of the Cash Only peer-to-peer network.  You send them the $5 plus a small thank-you bonus on Venmo, they hand over the cash, and dreading the phrase ""cash only"" becomes a thing of the past.How it worksCash Only is a mobile web app built on the Ruby on Rails framework.  It utilizes the Venmo API for person-to-person payments and Parse for its backend data.Challenges we ran intoWe spent that majority of this hackathon attempting to learn how to use PhoneGap.  PhoneGap allows developers to write apps in HTML and JavaScript, then it compiles into Android, iOS, and other native applications.  We thought that PhoneGap would be the perfect solution for creating an app that used HTTP APIs like a web app, while at the same time tracking user location in the background like a native app.  Unfortunately, while PhoneGap is a web app internally, it is not actually designed for use with HTTP APIs like Venmo.  We found several hacky implementations of HTTP APIs online, but none of them would work on our machines.  Therefore after approximately 24 of the 36 hackathon hours we switched to making a Ruby on Rails app so the Venmo API could be used properly.What\'s next for Cash OnlyWe see Cash Only becoming a platform like Lyft or AirBNB, where individuals can disrupt corporate monopolies and everyone gains convenience.

"The Streets","Authentic street performances","[3229, ""What makes New York City New York City is, street music/dance performances. There are numerous talented and free-spirited artists here and they don't have much communication means with their audience. We wanted to provide a platform for people who enjoy street arts and artists. How it worksWhen a user of the app sees a nice street performance, they can upload a real-time video that automatically includes the location and time. The videos can be shared with other people including tourists who want authentic street art experiences in New York City. If the dancer has a profile on the app, then you can directly make a payment to the performer. Also, you can donate to an artist after watching a video without having to be on-site of the performance. In addition, you can get future event schedules of the street dancer. If you're within 100 meters of the performance of interest, you will get a notification on your phone that you are nearby a cool performance. If you're close enough to the dancer, the app will show you how close you are to the performers with the bluetooth integration with Gimbal. Challenges I ran intoThe hardware limit was the biggest challenge in the process of development of this app. We wanted to give the user an exact number for how far is the performance, but the bluetooth integration had a limitation of detecting the distance. Accomplishments that I'm proud ofFirst of all, we incorporated 3 different apis: MasterCard api for the payment, Esri for map view and Gimbal for geo-location and geo-fencing. Out of all, our biggest accomplishment is the video view laid on top of the Esri map api in a bitmap drawable with real-time information.What I learnedThose who came here to make money will not get much out of the hackathon as opposed to those who came to make an app out of passion.

"P2Poll","A distributed voting application that uses a blockchain to prevent election tampering and voter suppression.","[4442, 'Accusations and suspicions in regards to the integrity of elections have always been an issue, but in recent years, we have seen an increasing distrust in the voting process. Several controversies surrounded the recent midterm elections, from ballot harvesting and registration fraud to voter suppression. Online voting and decentralizing elections through blockchain technologies will not only boost voter participation, but also allow for greater transparency in the voting process. ', 'The distributed application identifies unique voters using public-key cryptography, and voters use both their public and private keys to cast a vote on a referendum or poll, which propagates through the network until it becomes confirmed in a block by a miner. The blockchain allows individual voters to be anonymous, but keeps the immutable ledger of votes public in order to prevent fraud and tampering. ', 'A significant amount of time was spent brainstorming how we would implement a blockchain that would function without cryptocurrency, and shift its focus to function as a voting ledger. We eventually settled on creating the backend with Python, using Flask as a local server to display the front end user interface. Bootstrap was used for CSS theming, and JavaScript for making AJAX requests between the front and back end. ', ""One of the first problems we ran into was how to incentivize people to mine the blockchain data. While a common reward is paying cryptocurrency to the first one who successfully mines the block, we did not have a reliable, approved source to fund this operation (spending tax dollars would undoubtedly be a controversial debate). We decided on providing the opportunity to start their own polls and collect data they are interested in. A harder challenge was actually creating the decentralized blockchain network and the public ledger that would record the collected data. Accomplishments that we’re proud ofWe’re proud of the fact that we were able to create a blockchain-based distributed application in such a short time frame, considering none of us have had experience working with cryptocurrency or blockchain related applications, or peer to peer networks before for that matter. We’re also immensely proud of our idea, and its potential to make a huge difference in the world through improving the democratic process and helping prevent fraud, corruption, and voter suppression, especially for minorities and oppressed groups.What we learnedIn adapting the blockchain model for cryptocurrency to work for voting, we had to really understand the advantages and drawbacks of online transactions and a decentralized network. While there are indeed risks of outside interference from malicious hackers and other technological threats, the blockchain mitigates the problems of voter suppression and voter fraud. In addition, we learned all the technical details of implementing blockchain with Python: public key cryptography, hashing functions and mining, proof of work, immutability of blocks by dependency of previous blocks’ hashes, etc. What's next for P2PollIn the future we hope to add more security measures to the blockchain and implement two factor authentication in an effort to live up to our mission and make voting even more secure. To make it viable in the real world, the incentive for mining must also be expanded upon, so only those who accumulate enough credits will be able to run custom polls on the blockchain. Finding a way to make a more robust registration system which verifies an individual’s identity will also be a major leap in making P2Poll viable in important referendums and even elections in the future.Built WithbootstrapflaskjavascriptpythonTry it outwww.p2poll.comgithub.com      Submitted to    BostonHacks Fall 2018Winner                Best Overall Hack (1st place)              Winner                Best Domain Name from Domain.com                  Created by  Julia MaYirui RuanBartholomew C.Jeff HuiComputer engineering student with an interest in solving social problems with technologyWilliam Pine "", ' ', 'In adapting the blockchain model for cryptocurrency to work for voting, we had to really understand the advantages and drawbacks of online transactions and a decentralized network.

"", ""One of the key challenges building Easy Agile Roadmaps was ensuring that the Epics appeared at the correct place on the roadmap.

"Ambient Noise","High-quality ambient sound loops on Amazon Alexa to help you fall asleep faster, sleep better, relax, and focus.","[6197, 'A few months ago I was welcomed with a new upstairs neighbor in my apartment complex. No big deal, right? Unfortunately for me, my new neighbor had a tendency to walk very loudly and adopted a dog shortly after moving in that insisted on barking for an hour every morning at 5am. As someone who really enjoys a solid night of sleep and thinks of mornings as the bane of existence, you can probably imagine my daily frustration. After a couple weeks of unsuccessfully trying to let my body adapt to the noise, I decided it was time to put my Echo Dot on my bedside to good use... ', 'To drown out my neighbor\'s (and her dog\'s) noisy morning routine I developed a ""Rain Sounds"" Skill consisting of a 1-hour loop-able track of rainshower background noise. After using the Skill for a couple weeks with considerable success, I published it to the Alexa Skill Store and was met with unexpected rapid growth and many positive reviews. It turns out that I wasn\'t the only one who thought Alexa would be a great ambient noise device! I responded to a swarm of reviews and emails asking for more sounds, leading me to develop and publish over a dozen individual ambient noise Skills. But what about the folks who wanted to use all my sounds? To help them avoid the potential pain of (up until recently) being required to enable each Skill before you can use them and assisting in the discovery of all the available ambient noises I had to offer, I decided to build a Skill capable of playing all the sounds from one simple prompt.Enter the consolidated ""Ambient Noise"" Skill. ', 'The Ambient Noise Skill is built upon the Node.js Alexa Skills Kit Audioplayer Example for AWS Lambda as a baseline for building proper Alexa audioplayer responses and persisting user data with DynamoDB. Since most folks listen to these ambient noises while they sleep, it was vital for the Skill to never abruptly switch sounds and to be able to handle an influx of traffic during nighttime hours. To address these concerns, I modified the example project to disable the concept of a ""playlist"" in favor of looping a specified track and used AWS Lambda to run my project\'s code. Additionally, I used incrementing values in the user\'s DynamoDB record to keep track of how many times each sound has been played and when the user was last active in order to personalize the Skill\'s speech and playback behavior in the future. All in all, it\'s not a horribly complex Skill, but a lot of thought went into creating a great, reliable user experience - and when it comes to voice applications, that\'s half the battle! ', 'Although Ambient Noise is a relatively simple Skill, I ran into a particular challenge of slot-only utterances not always being recognized properly. Sometimes I would say a sound but Alexa would act like she didn\'t hear anything, and other times the result was simply inaccurate. But hey, let\'s be honest: NLP (Natural Language Processing) is hard. While I\'m sure the smart folks at Amazon are working every day to improve Alexa\'s interpretation of human speech, I needed an immediate solution. To resolve the issue, I created another intent (appropriately called ""soundOnlyIntent"") which had only one sample utterance attached to it: {Sound}. That\'s right - by isolating the utterance to its own intent Alexa was able to build a better language model. Ta-da! Problem solved! ', ""When it comes to Voice User Experiences (VUX), ensuring that your Skill can react correctly to users' requests is extremely important. Humans phrase things in a myriad of ways and natural language processing (NLP) doesn't always translate a user's speech into a perfectly-matching Skill Slot Value. To account for this, I did two things. First, I added an utterance to allow a user to get a list of supported sounds, allowing them to hear an example of what the Skill expects them to say. But more importantly, I created a function to take in a potential slot value, cast it into lowercase-only characters, then cross-check it against a list of manually-made variations based on different ways that I could envision myself talking to the Skill. The result was over 130 variations of ways to say 13 different sounds. "", ""When first making this Skill I didn't have a firm grasp of how state handling was performed in the Node.js Alexa Skills Kit Audioplayer Example. While some Skills need to keep a detailed track of a user's state to be able to resume a complex interaction if they were to leave and come back, this Skill was quite the opposite: using multiple states actually made the Skill much more complicated than it needed to be. This forced me to learn how state handling is implemented in the ASK Node.js library so that I could reliably strip down the audioplayer example project my code was built upon to only use a single state. Not only did this process result in a lean codebase for Ambient Noise, but it also gave me the knowledge to build complex stateful Alexa Skills in the future. "", ""Listening to user feedback and watching for unhandled requests from users' commands are vital to making a 5-star Skill. I'll be monitoring user feedback closely - both in reviews and via direct emails from users - to see what sounds I should add next. Additionally, I'll be using the analytics I've set up with VoiceLabs to watch for different variations of spoken names of sounds which I did not account for so I can improve the Skill's ability to play the right sound no matter what alternative name a user may have for it.

We knew we can contribute in saving lives by ensuring the fastest response of medical staff and volunteers (certified CPR/first aid volunteers)  to reach people in need. However, we soon realized that almost all of the Hajj technical problems can be solved by exploiting the shared problematic factor: data, that is associated with both space, and time: SpatioTemporal data.Initially, the team thinking was about tackling one domain, however, we questioned what if our customers are developers, architects targeting Hajj applications? Why not establish HajjTech solutions similar to what is happening with FinTech? What problems would Hajj technical solution providers face? and how can we streamline developers to provide Hajj/pilgrimage related services and technologies? Moreover, what if we provide a platform for all developers and architects to streamline the development process, and finally what if we enable them to be builders and architects?To demonstrate such a platform, we chose the medical use case ""Alert, that is alert nearby help via targeted broadcasts"", a PoC with the most impact. Saving lives by helping medical staff, especially for cardiac-arrest cases where response time is crucial. This will complement the official efforts by utilizing volunteers and spatiotemporal data in a sustainable way to reach persons in need within a target of 3 minutes.In addition, as a side effect of deploying such apps in the field, it will enable the collection of actionable data that can help in improving the notification and real-time tracking of app subjects (e.g. ambulances, scouts, volunteer doctors/nurses, certified CPR personnel).

"The Prometheus Network","Making medical information accessible to those without internet access using a SMS-based service.","[4858, ""Electronic health records are an integral part of a proper healthcare delivery model. In order to properly treat patients, doctors need to know patient's drug history, family medical history, allergies, diseases, symptoms, complication, and etc. These are just some of the many things you would find in a EHR that could potentially save your life. Contemporary EHR solutions rely on a internet connection, which is easy enough in areas with access to the internet. As of 2012 (most recent statistic we found), only one third of people have internet access, while nearly two thirds have SMS coverage. Cellular coverage is much more ubiquitous than internet coverage, so we created a way to transmit medical data in a compressed and heavily encrypted way, over SMS. This way, EHR can be available to significantly more people world wide.  "", 'Doctors (without any internet connection, only using SMS) can send a text to our number with a patient name. Their message gets redirected to Prometheus servers where the request is logged. Then the patient they are requesting data on will get a message asking them for permission for that doctor to get data about them. If they approve it, the doctor will get an encrypted text back with all of the relevant data. The doctor can then copy and paste that into a downloadable offline web app which will decrypt and uncompress the data in a more easily viewable format.The Prometheus network essentially allows advanced countries to leverage their technology to help other lesser developed countries, without having to add any hardware or any new infrastructure to those other areas.The doctor also has the capability to override the authentication process using a special code. This is only meant for absolute emergencies, and doing so automatically notifies authorities so they can dispatch local medical attention to the area. ', 'We used an AWS EC2 instance to host all of our code. We created a CGI handler page using python that we connected as a webhook to twilio. Whenever someone texts our number, it goes to the CGI page. That python script connects to multiple databases for translations between names and phone numbers, getting patient information, and getting approval for doctors to get information. ', 'None of us had ever used twilio before, so that was a learning process. It was also challenging designing the way that it asks patients for information, because the way twilio is set up is less of a chat bot and more of a message sending service. So, any information the user typed in previously has to be stored and managed ourselves. ', 'It can send and receive messages, ask for authentication, and allow the doctor to access to the patient data with proper permissions. ', 'We learned about how to send data through SMS messages and about different ways to compress medical data using special pre-defined medical codes. We also learned about encryption protocols across multiple different languages (Python and Javascript). ', 'A huge benefit the scalability of this solution. More information can be added onto the EHR and Blockchain integration will allow for an extra security measure to the server. Integration into current EHR programs would expand the functionality.

It’s aim is to make them ready to learn conventional text-based computer programming languages.In this game users will use their problem-solving skills to get the robot to the goal while learning the basics of programming. Currently the game has eleven levels, each level gets a bit more challenging and introduces the player to programing concepts such as functions, loops and conditionals. ', 'Since the idea was to create an application that will teach programming in VR and 3D, I had to figure out how to make the app usable in both case. The first approach involved creating a text IDE within the scene that would allow users to type the code, but that idea would not workout because VR users will not be able to access the keyboard that easily. So I had to think of another way to allow users to code within the scene. While doing some research I came across a block-based programing library called Blockly, this library is used for creating visual block programming languages and editors, this was perfect for my project as it would allow VR users to drag blocks around with a pointer and also allow browser users to drag blocks with a mouse, track-pad or touchscreen.The next step was to integrate Blockly with Amazon Sumerian, this was a challenge, but after a few days I managed to setup the scene with an HTML-3D entity that displays the Blockly toolbox and workspace. Next I had to figure out how to control the 3D objects in the scene using the Blocks on the HTML-3D entity this was also a challenge, but I figured out how to do it by emitting messages to the state machine each time the user drags a block to the workspace. Next I programmed an 8x8 grid that would define the path the robot has to take to get to the goal and I also designed and implemented some levels.Next I created 2 more HTML-3D entities, one to display the generated JavaScript code and the other to display information.

"Magnacle","Use the most secure password to fortify your online accounts : your voice","[5467, 'Remembering passwords is a hassle, but using a master password is even more cumbersome. Somebody gets access to that, and you’re screwed. Why not use something that only you have access to: your voice? Using Knurld’s revolutionary voice-authentication API, we help users manage their online passwords via a simple yet secure chrome extension. Say hello to the next level of security! ', ""Magnacle is a password manager for Chrome that uses's Knurld’s voice-authentication API to encrypt and store passwords on your machine. This chrome extension helps users manage their passwords by replacing all of them with the most secure password : their voice. Passwords are encrypted using 128 bit AES and saved on the user’s machine, so no information is shared with the outside world (unlike other popular password managers). The user’s voice is used to securely communicate with the server and get the key for decrypting these passwords. The key is not stored permanently on the device which makes it secured. "", 'The back-end is essentially a RESTful API written in nodeJS. The async functionality and fast I/O of nodeJS makes it perfect for our application.  The front-end website (for users to register their voice) is accessible from the chrome extension. The chrome extension (password managing) is written in JS; it records the user’s voice and forwards it to the back-end server via HTTPS, which then uses Knurld’s API to verify the person’s identity. ', 'Thanks to Knurld’s easy to use documentation, we didn’t run into any problems regarding the voice authentication part. We did,however, spend quite some time on the chrome extension (making sure that passwords are filled in not just any form, managing sessions efficiently and other minor details). ', ""The procedure to decrypt user passwords is secure end-to-end, with HTTPS for communication for the key/audio, Knurld for user verification and password encryption on the machine to secure them. Most popular password managers store encrypted passwords with themselves, which some users may not like.We, however, store the passwords on the client device only, so there isn’t any scope of compromising passwords from our end.WorkflowThe person installs Magnacle through chrome app-store.Magnacle requires the user to do an initial registration , providing username, a password and their voice.Then, the user logs into the extension using their username and password, so as to get the access token which authorizes their machine to allow voice authorization from that accountThis data is removed from the client's side and only their username and access token remains on their machine. The server contains username, password, and access-token to cross check in its database.Now whenever the user opens Chrome later on the machine in which they had logged in (ie, machine with the access token), he/she can open our extension and authenticate using their voice.If the authentication is successful, the client is given the key with which the password-data has been encrypted on their machine. In case nothing has been encrypted, Magnacle  requests a new key from the server The server then produces a random key and stored the key against the user account's record in its database. The client, then, stores the key on their machine (for that session).Magnacle works normally, that is, it provides auto-fill for websites that are already hashed in the local storage, and provides the option to do so on new websites.When the user closes Chrome or it crashes, Magnacle removes the key from the local storage. Now, the local storage once again contains username, access token and the encrypted password files.The server database contains username, master password, last valid access token (or null), last valid key, consumer-ID (for Knurld).In case the user logs out from Magnacle at any point of time, their access token and encryption key are removed, thus making the stored passwords uncrackable (as they are encrypted, and the key is note stored on the machine after this step).

"RoboVision","Assisting the visually impaired through a robotic companion (like a guide dog)","[8242, 'There is a person at our school who is unfortunately visually impaired. Usually, a person with a visual impairment would have to rely on either his own senses with a walking stick, the guidance of another individual, or the senses and guidance of a guide dog. This person in particular is allergic to dogs, so he usually has to navigate his way throughout the day with the aid of a friend or on his own with his walking stick. While brainstorming an idea, we were immediately drawn to the plight of this individual, and we decided to create something that would not only help change that particular instance of a struggling individual, but we sought to create a product that can be easily made into a small business that could be easily reproduce the product on a global scale, and completely revolutionize a rather currently cumbersome field. ', ""On the surface, our solution is simple: we have a robot that accompanies the individual,responds to environmental stimuli, and effectively communicates the presence of such obstacles to the individual who then makes a response. In addition to this, it can recognize objects around the user and tell the user what they are. The robot can be controlled with voice commands or gyroscopic control. Unlike walking sticks or guide dogs, which tell the user that an obstacle in their path exists, our project can actually recognize obstacles in the user's path, and can alert the user through audio telling him or her what stands in their path. The user, now knowing more about what is in their way, can then say a command to the robot, telling it which direction to proceed in to continue its journey. "", 'We built a simple robot in mindstorms nxt as a platform to test on, our service will work with any robot which can hold a camera, such as a drone. We built a bluetooth serial library from the ground up which runs precompiled programs on the robot to move it through serial commands. We then ran this library off of a node js server, which coordinated data gathered from the iPhone camera and allowed the user to control the robot through either voice or gesture commands. ', ""Possibly the largest challenge we ran into was optimizing the code. We had a very complex stack with more than five different languages and we wanted the user to be able to control a robot responsively through a variety of inputs, including gesture, gyroscopic control, and speech. In the end, however, by using lightweight libraries, getting rid of as much networking as possible, and writing clean code in machine-close languages, we were able to make a responsive robot with a large tech stack.Originally, our team was split in two. One group focused on the visual recognition capabilities of the robot, while another focused on using the Samsung Gear S2's gyroscopic capabilities to create a smooth control system for the robot which could be used to direct the robot in the direction of the user's walking path. The Gear S2 however, does not use Android Studio or Java to create apps, but rather an industrial grade IDE called Tizen which uses C. I had never worked with C before, and I had to pore over the API's to understand how to structure my code to access the gyroscope values. We also had to figure out how to get information from the robot's camera, to Firebase, and finally to the smartwatch which would read out the information via audio. While we were able to link information from the camera to Firebase, the development environment of the smartwatch proved to be too difficult to work with, and unfortunately we had to look to other options. Another issue we ran into was controlling the NXT through Python. The NXT robot was originally used just for concept design and prototyping, because we had originally hoped to use a drone to complete our hack. When that was not an option available to us anymore, we decided to just go ahead with the NXT. Since we were not using a normal controlller, and since we wanted to transer NXT values to Firebase, we had to create our own control system over bluetooth from the ground up using Python. We also had to custom create a control system that allowed auditory controls in which the user could give auditory commands to control the direction of the robot, which also allowed us an alternate solution to robot control once we realized the smartwatch control system may not be viable. "", 'First and foremost, as a seasoned team that has has won and mentored at many hackathons, including LA Hacks, HS Hacks I and II, Los Altos Hacks, and more, we welcomed other teams to ask us any questions they had and we were more than happy to set aside our own project when necessary and help out younger hackers. We love the hacker community, and we want to see it grow :).Our team is extremely happy with the results of our hack. We were working with systems that were extremely high level, such as OpenCV for visual recognition, gyroscopic sensors, and audio recognition for commands. Although there were aspects of this hack where we unfortunately could not get to function, we realize that this is just an** MVP (Minimum Viable Product) **which is an essential first step in creating a small business that creates a revolutionary product. Since all members of our hacking team are extremely proud and passionate of this product, we are sure to take the lessons and accomplishments from this hackathon and apply it to further refinement of our product. ', 'We were not familiar with C, which we had to use for the photon and a smartwatch app we tried to implement. We plan to implement this app in the future because we were not able to fully connect the gyroscopic control. In addition to this, we learned a lot about code optimization, and how languages like C run much faster and much closer to the machine than languages like python.We not only expanded upon our teamworking abilities, but also had the opportunity to learn a variety of coding technologies. For example, we obtained the knowledge of how to work with azure  and interpet bluetooth information aong devices in order to seize the data which wa essential to our hack. We believe that the combination of hardware and software we had to create, as well  as the extensive debugging process we ventured upon taught us how to polish our projects. ', 'In the future we plan to expand our company and product and make Robovison a global brand. We envision us expanding our product beyond the device bot we have created here to additional products such as drones to accompany individuals, and will be released at a cheap and easily produced format to revolutionize the medically impaired assistance industry. People who are unable to pay the high cost for guide dogs but do not want to sacrifice their safety or mobility will now have a viable alternative.

The quadruped, which is modeled after a canine, uses a custom genetic algorithm to learn to walk. We simulated their muscles and evaluated the dogs using a fitness formula, which determines the best dogs that should start the next generation. Each dog's purpose in life (as evaluated by the fitness score) is to walk as far as possible, with bonus points for standing up and keeping their head up high.The dogs have instincts, which are rules to speed up the evolutionary process. Their primary instinct is to move the limbs in a random sinusoid pattern, not completely sporadically. They also have an optional instinct to move left and right muscles in sync. The physicality of the dogs includes many physics based bones and joints, which are stimulated by the dog’s brain to move randomly. No premade animations were used and all walking patterns are emergent.Use-casesThere are many possible future directions to explore with machine learning. These techniques can be used to make learning robots, optimize processes, and improve self driving vehicles.Future ideasIf this project were continued, we would like to have our creatures learn to respond to variables such as seeking out food sources, avoiding obstacles, or adapting to changes in the simulated physical environment. We also had more animals planned than we had time to model but the code works for any animal, even a human or a fish. In the future, we would like to explore different gaits such as trotting or running. Motions such as sitting, standing up, and jumping may require more thorough biomechanical modeling. In the future, our models might have a flexible spine, muscles, and tendons in order to produce more lifelike simulations.

"T28 WeeFee","Americans waste $37 billion every year on unused mobile data - stop the madness and get your money back with WeeFee.","[4469, 'People spend a lot of money on mobile data that never gets put to use. Annually, a staggering $37 billion worth of mobile data gets wasted by Americans. What if you could somehow stop this wastage by renting out your unused data to others around you? Our aim is to provide this service. ', 'WeeFee allows you to broadcast a Wi-Fi signal to other devices using your mobile data plan, keeping track of the amount of data each person consumes. Using this information, the people using your data plan can get billed based on how much they use. Surely, the cost of this data is at a fraction of what phone companies would charge. This allows you to make some money from your excess mobile data while also providing internet access to others who may want it. WeeFee also maintains the privacy of users and their activity, as it is built on top of current hotspot technology. ', ""The WeeFee Android app interfaces with existing hotspot technology. We group users into two subsets - lenders and borrowers. Lenders automatically create hotspots that borrowers can recognize. In near real-time, we monitor the amount of data flowing out of connected borrowers and keep a running sum of this amount for each lender. No public API exists that lets us easily monitor network traffic or manage hotspots without root access. We got around this by delving deep into Android's source code and using Reflection to expose critical network functionality. We subsequently fed this data through an API we built running on top of a LAMP architecture hosted on AWS.Our approach is scalable, secure, and lightweight. We also built a data analytics layer so that users can monitor their activity on the application.  "", ""The main challenge we faced was how to manipulate the WiFi hardware on the device. Android is especially troublesome because different hardware manufacturers support different levels of access - the platform itself is also fragmented, which made it very difficult to initially test functionality.As we mentioned above, no public APIs exist that let us set up hotspots or easily monitor network traffic. That doesn't mean the code is totally hidden, though! We used Reflection to access private API methods, which we then leveraged to automatically turn on hotspots with pre-configured SSIDs. To get around the traffic monitoring issue, we eventually discovered a way to grab the total amount of data sent by a device since it was last booted. Via some more clever hacks, we were able to extrapolate the amount of network traffic passed through a particular device in a given time interval.Once we got past this, we had to figure out a good way to identify these SSIDs. We experimented with GPS-based identification, but eventually settled on a more simple approach wherein we prefixed SSIDs with a unique identifier.Finally, we had to come up with a performant, battery efficient mechanism for logging all of this data and choosing between potentially numerous hotspots.  "", ""We finished a working prototype that lets users borrow and lend mobile data. This is what we set out to do!We're also especially happy with our UI, which allows users to easily use the application - there's a single page, the user has to click on a button, and they're off to the races. Our data analytics page is also pretty unique. We show traffic data for each node in a dynamic graph that updates in real time. "", 'We learned a lot about low level Android programming. In particular, how to use private internal Android APIs. We also learned how to effectively handle numerous background services and set up publicly accessible APIs using AWS.

The Route Data Cloud analyzes all of the trip data and proposes new Metro routes that cover the most popular and most congested driving routes in the cityThe Roll Together mobile app also lets our users browse potential new routes for the Sao Paulo Metro and see how the construction of a particular new route could reduce their commute time as well as save them money.Following in the footsteps of successful crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo, Roll Together lets users invest in their community via a dedicated crowdfunding platform. Through the mobile app, our users can pledge money toward the construction of new Metro routes, share their pledges via social media, and see which routes their friends have pledged support for. Roll Together also includes an administrative dashboard which allows government officials and policy makers insight into both realtime and historical trip data to improve short term traffic management initiatives.The administrative dashboard also provides a summary of the proposed Metro routes and associated pledges from the Roll Together crowdfunding platform. Public transit planners can use this information to organize and demonstrate support for new construction initiatives which will have a long-term impact on the traffic situation in Sao Paulo. ', 'The Roll Together Route Data Cloud backend was implemented as a Python/Flask REST API backed by MongoDB as our database. This system keeps track of trips our users have made, and computes routes from those trips using a nearest neighbor clustering algorithm. It also exposes a REST endpoint which OpenXC-equipped vehicles can use to upload realtime trip information in a standardized JSON format. The Roll Together Crowdfunding Platform backend was implemented as a Node.JS application which talks to the Route Data Cloud, serves up the admin dashboard, and provides an API used by the mobile app. The Roll Together Mobile App was implemented using the Ionic / AngularJS mobile application framework running on top of Apache Cordova. For this prototype, we only tested and submitted an Android build, but our decision to use Cordova makes developing and releasing an iOS app is extremely easy.The Roll Together Admin Dashboard was implemented using AngularJS with Angular Material theme, integrating charting support from Chart.js.

We know that it’s hard to capture the needs of our users without experiencing the traffic situation first hand, however we believe our system addresses many of the very real pain points experienced not only by Sao Paulo, but every crowded metropolitan area.Another challenge we ran into is that our platform was designed to automatically capture GPS trip data from OpenXC-equipped Ford vehicles, however neither of us own one so we couldn’t do any end-to-end integration testing. Instead we relied on reading online documentation and using simulated data to build out our application.Accomplishments that we’re proud ofAs a small team of just two individual developers, we were very proud of our ability to create a fully featured app from scratch that addresses the short-term and long-term needs of Sao Paulo’s commuters. Not only did we give users a way to support the Metro lines they care the most about but we helped them identify which routes those were through analyzing their current driving behavior.

"SmartCab","Blockchain based Egalitarian Routing and Financing of taxi shared taxi-cab rides","[5826, 'Mobile based On Demand TaxiCabs are disrupting the transportation landscape and yet causing grief in the form or expensive ""surge"" pricing. The goal of this project was to create a more Egalitarian ecosystem that recognizes the rights of TaxiCab Drivers to a just wage; the rights of consumers to fair and transparent pricing and last but not the least provide a way for Car Manufactures like Ford to participate and thrive in a period of stagnating auto sales. ', 'The above is achieved via two orthogonal systems viz Egalitarian Routing and Blockchain based Egalitarian Finance Model.Egalitarian Routing:Here the hack focused on creating a visual interface which allows women passengers to choose other women passengers. This increases the safety of women passengers. And with more women sharing a cab the price of ride comes down. However it introduces an unusual side effect. Greedy Surge Pricing vs Egalitarian Pricing.Uber has introduced the concept of surge pricing which benefits the driver and Uber at the cost of consumers.  An Egalitarian routing system that is beneficial to passengers, comes from the pocket of the driver as he might, have to, at times drive without a passenger (Male passenger might be available but rejected in view of safety). Hence Blockchain is used to note down the “good behaviour and monetary sacrifice”. The good behaviour is then subsequently rewarded at the end of the month.Blockchain based Egalitarian Finance Model.There are 3 players in the Blockchain based Egalitarian Finance Model. Each player has different goals and different vested interest. Blockchain is used to come to a common consensus and results in win -win for all.Passengers of Taxi-Cabs:Ideally want least cost of rides with no waiting time. Safety is paramount. Ready to pay a bit more (but not much more)Taxi-Cabs: Maximize the number of people carried in least number of trips to increasing profits. Typically a cab driver has very little in the form of a credit history and lives in pay-as-you-go world. This means he pays the highest interest rate and highest rate for car repair and maintenance.Car Manufactures:Have the ability and means to get best interest rates worldwide and implement and maintain sophisticated Blockchain based solutions. Their interest lies in creating a stable eco-system that predictably consumes the cars being produced.By creating a Blockchain based Egalitarian Finance model Car Manufactures provide cheaper access to credit to Taxicab drivers (who have no credit history or balance sheet to negotiate better rates). This incentive doesn’t come free. Its provided only to those drivers that act in an Egalitarian fashion, buy Ford Cars and provide the service the consumers demand.  Consumers in return have to buy “Ford Egalitarian Pass” a Blockchain based rewards program at the beginning of every month. This stable inflow of funds is used to reward drivers and pay for the slightly increased cost of travel at normal times [Yet cheaper than surge pricing]. A part of these funds goes to Ford for bearing the associated credit risk. The travel rates can change as more information and behaviour of drivers gets recorded on the Blockchain. Passengers who use this system more can also be rewarded. By locking in Passengers and Drivers via the Blockchain based incentive scheme Ford can create a pool of taxi-cab drivers that buys only Ford Cars. ', 'Using Meteor the Front end and Egalitarian Routing was built. This can be accessed via desktop, laptop, mobile and tablets.The Blockchain part was built on IBM Bluemix Blockchain (Beta).

""Damn, that would look good on me (or my wife)"".You go home and try to look for it: ""beautiful red dress"". Google gives you 110,000,000 results in 0.54 seconds. Well that helped a lot. You think of checking the fashion websites, but the number of these e-commerce websites makes you refrain from spending more than a few hours. ""This is impossible..."". You perseverance only lasts so long - you give up. Fast forward to 2017. We\'ve got everything from Neural Forests to Adversarial Networks. You go home to look for it: Launch Dream.itYou make a chicken-sketch of the dress - you just need to get the curves right. You select the pattern on the dress, a couple of estimates about the dress. Dream.it synthesizes elegant dresses based on your sketch. It then gives you search results from different stores based on similar dresses, and an option to get on custom made. You love the internet. You love Dream.it. Its a wonderful place to make your life wonderful.Sketch and search for anything and everything from shoes and bracelets to dresses and jeans: all at your slightest whim. Dream.it lets you buy existing products or get a new one custom-made to fit you.How we built itWhat the user seesDream.it uses a website as the basic entry point into the service, which is run on a linode server. It has a chatbot interface, through which users can initially input the kind of garment they are looking for with a few details. The service gives the user examples of possible products using the Bing Search API. The voice recognition for the chatbot is created using the Bing Speech to Text API. This is classified using a multiclassifier from IBM Watson Natural Language Classifier trained on custom labelled data into the clothing / accessory category. It then opens a custom drawing board for you to sketch the contours of your clothing apparel / accessories / footwear and add color to it.

"Kids Court","No more fighting! Take your rivals to Kids Court and watch them get what they deserve. ","[5461, 'When I first observed how people interact with Alexa, I noticed most of the adult interactions are either voice commands (""add milk"") or questions/answers (""What\'s the weather?""). Kids interact with Alexa magically. They treat her as a real person captivated in a small box and love to chat with her like a friend.Once realizing that, my motivation for this contest was to create a social interaction between Alexa and a group of kids. Usually Alexa dominates the interaction and the kids respond; My approach was reverse - I wanted the kids to be able to initiate their own story and talk about what troubles them, and have Alexa be an active participant that listens and responds to them. I decided to address one of the most agonizing parts of family life - kids fighting - and created Judge Lexy which is an objective, quirky judge that helps kids settle their battles. Welcome to Kids Court. ', 'Kids Court lets kids (and their parents!) settle their arguments in a fun way, while getting a peek into how the legal system works. The prosecutor states their case, the defendant answers, the kids can call witnesses and present evidence and finally Honorable Judge Lexy rules with funny dare-style verdicts that the losing side must execute. While kids probably mostly enjoy the revenge aspect, in the process they learn about the roles of a defendant, prosecutor, evidence, witnesses and more. They also learn to stand up for themselves in a calm manner, to articulate their problems coherently, and to take responsibility for their actions. Kids Court is intended for kids age 8 and up. Younger children can enjoy it too if someone explains the legal vocabulary.  ', ""I designed an algorithm that helps Judge Lexy determine if the defendant was guilty or not. I crafted a user experience that covers many use cases and is meant to be fun and engaging for the kids even if Judge Lexy rules against them.I also added a few easter eggs to surprise the kids, and put in explanations of some basic legal terms that the kids can ask about when they're unsure (i.e what's a prosecutor?). Technically, as I wanted to focus on content and user experience, I used thestoryline.io to build the entire skill. There are dozens of different logical paths and various possible responses for Lexy to make her character more engaging and the overall experience more entertaining. "", ""My motivation was to create an experience where Alexa is a social facilitator for a group of 2-4 participants. The skill has to let them talk freely and make them feel like Lexy is listening and responding to everyone. As every teacher/parent can probably attest, it was very challenging to create a natural yet structured conversation that keeps the kids in control, lets everyone feel heard, and teaches them something in the process.A major challenge was that Alexa doesn't pick up some of the things the kids say as either they talk too fast, get excited and step out of the flow, or can't help themselves and talk together. I tried to go around this by expanding the possible utterances for each state and creating default responses for almost everything they might say.   "", ""Kids and parents alike seem to really enjoy this skill. I tested it on a small focus group and it was beautiful to see how responsive the kids were, how naturally they engaged in the conversation and how much they enjoyed having Lexy listen to them. They interacted with the skill for a couple hours (!) and I'm really satisfied with how they believed Lexy was real and the pleasure they took in challenging her with many different cases. The best feedback was seeing their hilarious reactions whenever Lexy ruled. I was very pleased at how engaged the kids became even though there were no screens or any visual images involved. "", 'I learned how to design for voice and I learned a lot about how to design for kids. The idea I originally had changed tremendously once I tested it on real kids. Personally, this was the first product I ever built entirely on my own and not as part of a team. I had to deal with many issues that were new to me, such as voice design, use of ssml, technical jargon, finding and fixing vicious bugs that made the skill crash, legal aspects, sound effects, making a video and more. This was a super fascinating experience on many levels.  ', ""I plan to make Lexy smarter by implementing more investigation flows and a broader range of verdicts.Educationally, I'd like to take this game to the next level and introduce more concepts from the legal system such as an alibi, an objection, and more. I currently chose not to store any information about the users to make sure I comply with COPPA. I plan to look into it further and see how/if I can create a more personalized experience and create more value for returning players.Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy it!

The whole process can psychologically and physically drain a person honestly.Asides the stress and time wasting, there is so much monetary budget going into electoral processes. Recently, there were talks of allocating over a hundred billion naira just for the upcoming elections so as to provide ballot boxes and some other miscellaneous. So, when the hackathon process started, coming up with a solution that could positively impact my nation was not really difficult.Basically, all the expenses, the violence, the stress, the election rigging, the apathy exhibited by the citizens can be cut off to a maximum extent if the nation can introduce an online election system for her citizens.

"FC + BlinkCeption","Facial gesture enabled web control using computer vision","[5114, 'What starts with weakness in limbs soon progresses to muscle degeneration, which can rob a person’s ability to walk or use one’s arms. As of 2015, this is the harsh life of over 200,000 ALS patients. Similar conditions affect the day to day functioning of numerous physically disabled people around the world. We wished to try and lessen their difficulties. The first idea we thought of was to make their web experience  as seamless as possible. Since the nerve degeneration starts from below the neck, we thought of using Computer Vision to allow users to navigate websites completely hands-free using just their facial movements as captured by their webcams. ', 'Our project is a python program which enables users to interact with websites using just their facial movements such as eye blinks, eyebrow raises, and mouth opens. By using these movements, they can interact with buttons, dropdowns, slideshows, text fields and other web elements. Users are able to type text using a set pattern of facial gestures. These patterns are mapped to morse code and the output is shown in the form of text.Additionally, our program employs facial recognition to remember previous users and is able to run using the pre-saved ratios of their facial features. This means that our software can be used by multiple users. Finally, we allow the users to send emergency Emails and WeChat messages. Once the webcam detects no facial patterns for 10 seconds, an emergency message is broadcasted to all their preferred contacts. This is especially useful if people with disabilities happen to face an accident. ', 'Facial RecognitionWe use an existing library for implementing facial recognition of the user. This is used to verify and use pre saved thresholds unique to each user. For the blink, eyebrow raise and mouth open detection, we use a pre trained model that takes in a video frame and returns a list of 68 (x,y) coordinates of the facial landmarks detected. We then perform computations on this data to get the respective thresholds.Morse Code DecipherThe typing process consists of registering a blink as a dot and an eyebrow raise as a dash. Once the user is satisfied with the current pattern typed, they can open their mouth to enter the string into our decipher function.

And then other viewers would jump in on the pot saying they will add $3 per kill, and so on, and the streamer would accept the mission and put up notepad on OBS overlay and manually count their kills. Viewers who joined mid stream would not know what was going on. So we wanted to make an extension that not only helps organize this more visually.

', 'LeARn allows users to interact with physics simulations, plot 3D graphs, view MRIs, and watch the molecular structure of a chemical compound float before their very eyes. The user can move and manipulate these projections via an online client, affecting factors like scale, rotation, and position.

', 'LeARn was very difficult to build for a variety of reasons. Nobody on our team had worked in Unity before or even knew C#, so to call it a learning experience is an understatement. We used complex and highly detailed models, and optimising these such that they would render well on mobile presented a significant challenge in and of itself.

"ORB","A fun, arcade game that emphasizes fast-paced, mental arithmetic.","[5539, ""I was inspired by the lack of mathematics-based games that were fun. Before developing this game, I'd browsed the App Store for educational games that weren't only adding and multiplying problems with a fancy GUI, but games that could engage an audience.  "", ""Dash through colorful levels and bounce off numbered walls in ORB. Exercise strategy and fast mental arithmetic skills to progress and continuously beat levels to increase your high streak. Intuitively tilt your device to guide the ORB through the infinite amount of levels. Don't fly off the field, get caught in obstacles, or miss the goal! As part of the difficulty curve, the game gets harder as time goes by - slowly moving into new obstacles and adding multiplication, division, and subtraction obstacles over long periods of time. To try to engage a younger audience, I made the game start with simple addition. Of course, to keep the game entertaining, the task of controlling the ball - which, in itself, develops visual motor co-ordination skills - still makes the game addicting.   "", ""ORB was made using the Unity3D engine along with its C# libraries, and some custom Java frameworks I've made and exported to DLLs with IKVMC. As I'm familiar with Java, most of the statistics controllers and background game management controls were made in Java. However, to deal with input and GUI, I used Unity's built-in libraries. Personally, art is not my forte, hence the minimalistic and colorful design of the game. Still, I decided to go with Cinema4D to mock-up and make the 3D models for the cubes of various sizes. "", ""ORB was not my first app, but it was my first game and the first experience that I have really had using the Unity3D game engine. Nevertheless, I had some challenges in creating the algorithm and figuring out specific gameplay elements. In terms of gameplay, I had designed the game with Darts in mind. This game, which you have probably heard of, involves the player throwing a set of arrows, called 'darts,' onto a board. Certain areas are larger, and others are smaller. I decided to take inspiration from this game and create the numbered walls of different sizes so, for example, the wall which increases your score to 5, will be smaller, and thus harder to get to. Algorithm-wise, this was hard for me to create. The levels are all 'procedurally,' generated which calculates the difficulty that a level should be (by the score but the hidden time it takes to complete past levels); it's almost like a piecewise function which operates as either an exponential, logarithmic, or sigmoidal function. However, with the difficulty being calculated and with different walls put together, they wouldn't fit together like bricks. "", ""Overall, I’m proud of completing and creating my first 3D game. The entire experience of creating ORB was extremely enjoyable and was a really good project to begin and get used to the Unity3D workflow. I am really proud of this fact and I believe that I am now familiar with this workflow and can execute upon what was before, just a game idea, in multiple platforms. Additionally, I am pleased with being able to answer questions actively on the Unity3D forums and IRC channels. I'm also proud of getting a Twitch live streamer, GameDevCompany, to test out ORB on stream in front of an audience of about seventy people. "", 'I’ve learned a lot through simply experimenting and reading through Unity’s documentation. Generally speaking, I learned a lot about the development of gameplay mechanics and how to actually execute them using Unity, C#, and Java. The use of Java in itself was a completely new learning experience I’ve known Java for five years now, but I am completely new to the fact that you can convert Java source code and use IKVMC to convert it into a DLL, and make it run like a fully fledged library in Unity. Additionally, through ORB, I learned concepts of the functional programming paradigm, a particular type of declarative programming which focuses on using short, maintainable statements like algebraic expressions or functions. I used Java’s lambdas and C#’s LINQ to exercise some fundamental functional concepts (that are part of these mainly OOP languages), and also utilized the ideas of filters, sinks, and maps. ', ""The next release of ORB will involve an easier level system and also a store, which has already been completed. The store has all sorts of add-ons, such as the function of shapeshifting so the ORB can fit through crevices in between rocks. To purchase items in this store, there is a collection system and a streak system. Once you've tested it, you'll realise that I obviously plan to make the game easier - the difficulty curve is not perfect as yet!The latest build of the game (when uploaded to the App Store), will also have a checkpoint/milestone system. If you pass a streak of five (or any other multiple of five), you will always start at that checkpoint.

"ExplORer Surgical","Workflow management tool for the operating room that enhances communication, awareness, &amp; efficiency and reduces cost","[7071, 'Two surgeons performing the same operation at a given hospital will most certainly have individual preferences that differ based on technical operative steps, instruments, equipment and medications required for the case. If surgical staffing and human resource constraints were smaller and less complex, consistent teams could be formed, and any problems arising from this variability would be alleviated via team experience and subsequent familiarity. However, consistent teams are simply impractical, particularly at large academic and community hospitals. Although nurses are very well-trained and experienced, the the preferences of individual surgeons are very difficult to keep track of in the absence of a comprehensive and interactive technological solution.Delays and disruptions due to missing instruments and supplies are commonplace in surgery, and this is directly related to the lack of a clear and up-to-date guide to a given surgeon’s preferences. ExplORer was built to solve this problem, one which our clinician co-founder, Dr. Alex Langerman (an ENT surgeon and leading OR efficiency researcher), faced every day in his own operating room. Additionally, when the surgical case needs are unknown, the tendency is to open more instruments and equipment in an effort to provide for any possible needs. This is an inefficient strategy that leads to longer setup times and a substantial amount of waste (anything opened in the operating room needs to be discarded or resterilized); what’s even is the “open everything” strategy still does not guarantee that the needed supplies will be among the mass of materials that were opened. This misalignment of surgeon and case needs and staff activity is a pain point for both surgeons and nurses, and ExplORer directly addresses these overlapping team needs.Furthermore, by more accurately aligning surgeon preferences with operating room setup, we save hospitals money by decreasing OR time per case and preventing wasted supplies. More accurate setup and decreased delays can also lead to greater OR throughput, which may increase revenue for hospitals with high surgical demand.Surgeons’ preferences and what tools and supplies are used in which step of which cases is a treasure trove of data that can be leveraged for hospital clients as well as surgical device manufacturers and purchasing organizations. Knowing how surgeons perform procedures (which step in which order) has potential public health and surgical education applications. Additionally, the very act of using ExplORer during surgical cases generates granular data on procedure progress that can be used to streamline OR management and can fuel predictive analytics on surgical activity (e.g., anticipating when a surgical case will end so next steps can be planned). Currently, there is no commonly-used technology to capture this intraoperative data. ', ""ExplORer, a web-based, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) workflow management application, is an interactive surgical playbook that promotes optimal teamwork in the operating room. Best practices are built into a customized workflow for each case. Step-by-step instructions and diagrams help surgical team members follow along with the case and prepare for what's coming next; in doing so, we help deter delays and disruptions that can occur from missing or incorrect tools. We also aim to reduce the waste of disposable tools that are opened but go unused – a major component of the billions of dollars of surgical supply waste that occurs annually in the United States. Additionally, variability in cost has a negative impact on patient outcomes. The analytics component of our software allows hospital administrators to track surgical activities and costs to better manage their ORs and gain new insights for operational efficiency. "", 'ExplORer was built with MEAN stack (Angular.js, Express.js, Node.js, and Mongo DB), using Socket.io. The application is hosted on AWS with multiple EC2 application servers running Ubuntu OS. We also use HAProxy load balancers. ', 'We needed to have instantaneous synchronization of information between multiple team members in the Operating Room with separate browser sessions. We solved it with the use of WebSockets. ', ""We have built three generations of our program and currently have a commercial version of our software. Our preliminary pilot results show that with the use of ExplORer versus the baseline, setup time was reduced by 10%, tool-related disruptions were reduced by 42%, and cost of the case due to wasted items was reduced by 5%.  These results can be directly linked to team satisfaction and reduction in operating room time. These results suggest millions of dollars in annual savings potential, not just for large academic and community hospitals but even for smaller hospitals, simply by using our product. The potential for cost savings is heightened even further once we receive our next round of funding and are able to build out an aggregate data analytics dashboard for stakeholders to view the granular data that ExplORer collects during live surgical cases. As we prepare to make our first sales into hospitals, this dashboard delivers an integral aspect of ExplORer’s key value propositions.We have received several awards. We won $50,000 through the Pritzker Group Venture Fellows Program, were awarded 2nd place at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business’ New Venture Challenge, named one of four finalists in the Cleveland Clinic Innovations’ New Ventures Healthcare Challenge, and named one of the 150 Nominees for Chicago Inno's 50 on Fire competition.We have been funded by a Phase 1 and Phase 1B Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) grant from the National Science Foundation.

"Pinage","Leave Your Message, Lead Your Life","[6022, ""Let me tell you a simple story. Sometimes I leave notes for my family member at home or for my colleagues at my workplace, especially when they are not reachable. One day I leave an important document at my desk and leave a note for my colleague. But for an unknown reason my colleague does not get the notes, as a result he could not able to complete the task. I think almost all of us sometimes face this type of problem. From this incident, I and my team think that why we cannot make this an automatic process. i.e. we leave a message in a particular location and when someone enter that area that message will automatically popup. From that point of view, we come up with an idea Pinage, a simple location aware message service.How Pinage worksPeople sometime cannot reach their friends colleagues or someone to whom they want to notify something. Pinage is the simplest location based message tagging service to notify their contacts. Using Pinage you can just simply leave your message in a particular location for your friends or contacts. When your desired person enter that area the tagged message will automatically popped up. As a result, no one will ever miss your notes. In Pinage the message will store in the server for one day only, after that this message will be automatically deleted from the server.How we built itAt first we finalize our full project features and the needed tools and APIs. At the very beginning of the development process we focused on the simplest UX and UI design of Pinage. We used Google Design Sprint method to design the UX and UI of Pinage. During the UX design we design a couple of mockups. After finalizing the the UX we develop the server end of our app. We developed the server end by PHP and the mysql database to provide the service to the client app using Rest API.In Pinage client side is an native android application which is built with the ALOHAR location API. We developed the location aware messaging service in such a way that user can get the tagged message immediately after enter the specific area. We used the ALOHAR location service effectively and thus we successfully minimize the battery usage of device to detect the Geofencing event. We used the some external library such as android volley library for Rest API communication with the server. We also used other third party library in UI design of our app.Challenges we ran intoAt first when we started the Pinage development process, our main focus was to design the simplest UX. The UX design takes a lot of time to start our app development. Finally after a couple of mockups, we design the UX of Pinage application in such a way that user can easily put their message using just single tap. Now user can just type theirs message, select contact and a single tap will tagged in the user current location for their desired one.After that we faced a lot of problem in detection of user arrival or departure event with minimal usage of device battery. At first we did not read the ALOHAR documentation properly. But when carefully and thoroughly read and inspect the ALOHAR developer document, we saw that how easily we can detect any Geofencing event. After developing the Pinage the second most hurdle we faced during the app testing time, as we have to tag a message in a location and we have to wait until the ALHOR fires either arrival or departure event.Accomplishments that we are proud ofWe are tried how simply user can leave a message in a particular location and receiver can get the message as quickly as possible when the receiver enter a particular area. The main hardle was how to detect a Geofencing event, i.e. how we can determine when a user enters a place/area or leave that place. We successfully implement that feature with the help of ALOHAR location API. But the integration was not so smooth. We have to test that location based message popping feature several times to finalize that feature. But finally we successfully integrate this feature with the Pinage.We also design the UX of Pinage in such a way that user can simply pin a message without performing many unnecessary steps. In Pinage user can simply pin a message. Also receiver does not need to open the app to check whether there is any message; Pinage will automatically notify an user if there is a message for him/her.What we learnedOur team developed many locations aware application in which we try to provide some information when an user enter an area. But the main problem in those apps was, we have to periodically check whether user is in proximity of a particular location. This process drains the device battery a lot. In Pinage we used the ALOHAR with our wrapper library to reduce the battery drain in determination of any Geofencing event.What's next for PinageDuring this limited time we mainly implement the necessary features. But we have planned to add new features to smooth the user experience of Pinage. For example,  till now the message lifetime of Pinage in server is one day, but we have a plan to extend this so that user can have multiple option for the message lifetime such as one hour[for short message], one week[for long lasting message] or message with lifetime validity. We are also thinking to add message conversation for a particular topic in private or public mode.  We will also add the social network like facebook, google+ for signin or to allow user to  import their contact or share their public message.Built Withalohar-mobileandroidandroid-studiomysqlphp5Try it outplay.google.com      Submitted to    Create Context-Aware Applications with Alohar Mobile's SDK    Created by  I am the team leader of this project.

"Project Julius","Seizure Prevention Software","[6055, 'In 1997, an episode of Pokemon aired in 4.6 million homes in Japan. This episode had a scene with many quick flashes that caused 685 children to be hospitalized for photosensitive epileptic seizures.In 2008 an online community known as 4chan posted seizure-triggering images and videos on epilepsy related forums and websites.In 2012 a promotional video for the London Summer Olympics was reported to trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy.The threat posed to those with epilepsy in each of these incidences could have been significantly mitigated with software that detects when potentially hazardous elements are present on a screen, and blocks them.  This is what Project Julius does.The name comes from Julius Caesar, the roman emperor. Julius Caesar was an innovative leader who has been post-diagnosed with epilepsy. We aim to innovate the seizure prevention measures in place for video on computers.How it worksProject Julius monitors what is displayed on the computer\'s monitor and blocks quick image changes in order to prevent seizure triggers.Using CamTwist and OpenCV to capture the images on screen.  We then process them using a histogram analysis in broken-down regions of the screen to look for quick changes.  If high-frequency flashing is detected, a window is pushed above all other open windows, warning the user and covering the threat.In order to analyze the display to figure out if there are flashes that we should block, we perform a histogram analysis on the image. First, we take 2 consecutive frames and then divide them into a 10 by 10 grid of pixel regions. We then analyze the colour spectrum and create a histogram representing each region. Then, we evaluate the integral of the Hellinger Distance to find the Bhattacharyya Coefficient. This distance quantifies the similarities between the regions and allows to easily see major changes in the image such as a flash. If there is a 95% change in the image, determined with the Bhattacharyya Coefficient, then we declare it to be a ""flash event"". We then compare this result to the previous 10 results for each regions, if 60% of the frames contain ""flash events"" then the seizing guard is triggered and the window is minimized. We analyze  the display at 30fps, and require of 60% of the last 10 frames to contain dangerous flash events to declare a possible triggering event. This makes Project Julius able to catch possible seizure triggering events after only 0.2 seconds.Challenges we ran intoThe first challenge we ran into was being able to complete the capture, analysis, and blocking in real-time with zero lag.  We altered our algorithm and refactored most of our existing python code, ultimately accomplishing precise analysis with minimum resource consumption.The biggest challenge we ran into was being able to accurately detect when an image was flashing repeatedly, rather than an object moving or a scene changing. A lot of things seem like they could be flashes at first, but are clearly not when watched by a human. By comparing multiple frames one after another we were able to better analyze what is happening on the display.Accomplishments that we are proud ofOur proudest accomplishment is learning about epilepsy.  In order to understand the requirements of our project we had to learn a few things about epilepsy including triggers, effects, and number of people affected. However, we wanted to go further. Since one of our team members has had family experience with epilepsy we decided to learn more. We learned about multiple different kinds of epilepsy, triggers for different kinds, statistics, long-term effects, symptoms, and the demographic of affected persons. In our opinion, the coding may have taught us new ways to accomplish our tasks, but we think the knowledge we know have will have a greater impact on our lives. Epilepsy is something we have have to deal with first hand in our life be it friends, family, or anyone in public.What we learnedDuring the creation of Project Julius we learned a lot about Epilepsy and its causes. Using online resources we discovered how many people it affects, common triggers, long-term effects, and large incidents in public.We also learned a lot about how to process large images (upwards of 1080p) quickly and effectively using histograms of regions on the screen. The changes in the histogram values indicate a change in content, a large difference indicates a flash or scene change. We then had to further our analysis to compare multiple changes to detect the rate at which the image changes, and thus determine if we should block it.Our initial approach to capturing the screen was to use the low-level frame buffer built into Linux. We spent a few hours learning how to access and process the frame buffer but ended up deciding not to go with it. We felt that using something built into Linux would greatly decrease our potential reach so we changed our screen capturing method to be more portable and cross-platform by using OpenCV and native desktop capturing applications that can pipe into Python. We found multiple programs for the different operating systems such as CamTwist and ManyCam.What\'s next for Project JuliusProject Julius is in a state such that it can be applied in many situations, however it isn\'t ready to be released fully. We hope to continue development and create a fully refined and deployable application.

"StockAssist","Helping you invest.","[6834, 'Humans will invest in stocks they believe in and sell stocks they don’t believe in; it only makes sense to be logical when dealing with matters of money and finance. Thus, accurately predicting stock changes requires knowing which companies are currently trending in the public’s favor. What StockAssist brings to the table that is unique to our generation is generating predictions based on social media trends. Older generations may look to news sources to inform them of which stocks to invest in, but this implies a lag of possibly weeks as news sources need to gather their data and edit it before publishing. By the time the news reaches the crowd, its advice may already be outdated. With StockAssist, we cut out this lag entirely and give you the real-time general consensus of how a company stands by data mining and implementing machine learning on social media posts. This will give the most accurate prediction of how stocks will fare, and thus is revolutionary in advising people with their stock investment decisions.  ', 'This web application will take the stock in question and collect all the news, social media, and statistical data about that stock. It will then run this data through our machine learning algorithms to analyze how well the company is doing in the eyes of the public. With this application, the users will only need to check one place to find an aggregated analysis of their stocks from a diverse, real-time generated data set.  ', 'The first iteration of the application was written in Go. After discovering incompatibility issues with the Azure platform, the application was completely rewritten in javascript using Node.js. The application consists of two main parts the server and client, with each communicating with another through http requests.The server is where all of the heavy data manipulation is conducted. The server receives a query from the client via an HTTP GET request. The server then takes that query and using Twitter’s REST search api finds 1000 tweets that match that query. Then using regular expressions, the server strips and removes all the referenced URLs (in order to make the semantic analysis easier). After the data has been prepared, we perform an analysis of the tweets using semantic analysis tools hosted on Azure. The analysis tool then returns a score based the words used, and from that we generate a confidence statistic.The second part of the application consists of the client. As mentioned beforehand, the client sends a query to the server, and the server in turn returns a summary of the analysis it performed. The client then generates a stock recommendation based on a determining algorithm, displays a rough summary of that data using a pie chart, and gives a confidence statistic. The client was written in the standard HTML5/CSS/JavaScript while reference several other open source libraries for the visuals and the communications.      ', ""Developing a web application hosted on Microsoft Azure was our biggest challenge. Initially, our team used Go to develop the back-end of the application; however, Azure never seemed to be compatible with Go. Thus, we had to switch languages, and completely re-write the entire back-end in Node.js. Another challenge we faced along the lines of Microsoft Azure was figuring out the Machine Learning. It was difficult to create training models with the help of different statistics such as chi-squared. We attempted to create an optimal training model on twitter feeds based on binary sentiment analysis. Upon building the training models, it was another challenge to create a predictive experiment based on the optimized training model, and hosting the solution on the web. Although we couldn't get the machine learning algorithm to work, we made great headway in learning this sector of Microsoft Azure. AccomplishmentsDespite all the challenges present, we were able to finally implement Microsoft Azure as a web host for our application. Even though we did not completely figure out the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, we made great progress in learning how to utilize this tool to perform sentiment analysis on twitter feeds. In order to actually create the machine learning, we used a direct approach with sentiment analysis through node.js. On the front-end, we were able to coordinate all the back-end to co-exist with the front-end. The most important accomplishment was to develop the Azure hosting service, along with our web application.What I learnedThis hackathon was full of twists and turns and we definitely learned a lot from it. From how to use Azure to what web frameworks work best with our front end, our general takeaway for this hackathon was to remember to reach out for help. The Microsoft team was immensely effective in mentoring us and helping guide us to reach our goals; it’s been a game changer for us and it’s something we’ll be sure to do in future hackathons. What's next for STOCKASSISTWe’d love to expand on every aspect of our app. This means we’d love to include more and more social media outlets to better refine our data set, and thus use this to refine our machine learning algorithm as well.

The same approach applies to the Infrastructure solution.The solution supports multi-tenancy and we safely store the data to enrich the tickets (e.g. classify the object like the user, device or data of the c-level management).To elaborate on that, we gather information about security from the following sources:Graph API - Security AlertsSecure ScoreSecure Score Control Profiles (for recommendations on raising secure score)Graph API - Sign-InRetrieving the last sign-ins of a user to determine if authentication was with MFA enforced. If so automatically closing the security alert.Graph API - Directory AuditMonitor users for strange behavior, especially on sign-ins from an unfamiliar location.Next to the Graph API we also get information through Azure Resource REST API to gather: All Azure ResourcesWe get notified on resources that are not monitored by our SOC and therefore are a possible threat for breaches.

"Holdup","Send Gamified Messages to Your Friends!","[3896, 'Fun new ways to communicate with friends are growing in popularity, and we wanted to build a communication tool of our own. We took inspiration from the ""money maze"" toy, which locks a gift in a transparent cube maze. In order to unlock the cube and get the gift inside, the recipient must complete a complex puzzle. ', ""Holdup is an iMessage app that allows users to send secret messages and payments. The catch is that in order to read the message and accept the payment, the recipient must complete a challenging mini-game. The game uses the device's accelerometer, and is intended to frustrate users who want to read the message or receive their money. Senders can choose from three difficulty levels, and a unique game level is automatically generated. The communication is built directly into the iMessage platform, which allows users to send the mini-game to their friends, even if they don't have the app installed. "", 'The app is written in Swift and built with Xcode. It exists almost exclusively as an iMessage extension. The mini-game uses SpriteKit, a 2D game engine, to render sprites, simulate physics, and detect collisions. ', ""The iMessage platform has a lot of restrictions, many of which are undocumented. Because the app exists as an extension inside the Messages app, many normal app capabilities are unavailable. We ran into a dozen of such issues, and adapted the design of the app to fit into the given constraints. Although our final result had to undergo many unforeseen design revisions, we're happy that we were able to create a working and fun application. "", ""We're especially proud of our ability to iterate quickly. Our app design and vision experienced three major overhauls over the course of the weekend, and experienced many minor tweaks and adjustments. Some of these changes were prompted by an analysis of the app and consideration of how well it aligned with the user's goals. One quick example: We originally envisioned the ability to create custom mini-game levels via a drag-and-drop level builder. We thought that the sender would enjoy creating a custom experience for their friend, so they could be as nice or mean as they desired. As we considered the concept and talked with others, we discovered that the sender would rather be able to create a challenging mini-game quickly and generally finds more value in their recipient's reaction than the implementation of the actual game level. Since we structured the app well, we were able to react to these changes and make a better end product as a result. "", 'We learned a bunch about the Message extension iOS framework, but more generally learned about technical risk. When we committed to creating an iMessage app, we reaped many benefits, but also inherited some challenges. Because the technology and user experience are so tightly coupled, we had to make some tradeoffs that affected the end users. However, the additional constraints imposed by the framework forced us to ask tough questions and refine our idea more than we otherwise would have.

"Fonts Done Right","Font retrieval, generation, and manipulation","[6116, ' ', 'We aim to provide a toolkit for typographers to get the font right. We try to solve the above four challenges as follows in a ""deep learning mindset"":Hard to find existing fonts: nearest-neighbor retrieval in the latent space! Select two existing fonts, get the embedding of them, and you can retrieve an existing font with the taste of both.License issues: generate fonts with trouble-free data! We compiled a dataset of Google Fonts with the SIL Open Font License which ""permits the fonts to be used, modified, and distributed freely"" with ~2K fonts ~120K characters. We aim to learn a greater font manifold with the ""base fonts"" free of license issues.Font design is time-consuming: have fun searching for new fonts in the latent space! With latent vector arithmetics, you can achieve a style like ""get a bold Times font using a normal Times font and the bold-ness of Bold Helvetica without the Helvetica-ness"".Raster font images are not deployable: generate TTF vector files! With the generated raster image, you can train a model to trace the boundaries and obtain the vector font files (integration to the interface pending).Font generation is a field with huge potentials. A deployable font generation toolkit can change the entire workflow of a typographer and therefore reshape the design industry. ', 'We build all our models in PyTorch.Font retrieval model: we used the pre-trained model provided by [FIXME: add link] to retrieve fonts in the Google Fonts dataset.Raster font generation:1) Variational Autoencoder: we implemented our own autoencoder to learn the latent space of different characters and fonts.2) StarGAN: we modified the code of [FIXME: add link] to manipulate different attributes of a character, such as bold-ness and serif-ness.Vector font generation: we tried to reproduce the model proposed by A Learned Representation for Scalable Vector Graphics, implementing it from scratch. We first train a variational autoencoder on raster images and use gated recurrent units and a mixture density network to generate SVG commands and obtain vector font files. ', 'Attributes of a character can be hard to learn. For example, we tried to learn the serif-ness of a character with StarGAN, but it does not produce comparable results with simple latent space interpolation with VAE.The representation of a vector file is vastly different from that of an image. Even if we could get a correct base VAE model to generate raster images, the recurrent units to produce command tokens and numbers are hard to train and we could not get a reasonable result.Hooking up the back-end models with the front-end UI needs a lot of communication and engineering. ', 'Font retrieval modelCompiling the Google Fonts datasetInterpolation between two fontsManipulating the attributes of a fontGenerating SVG fonts ', 'In addition to providing a toolkit, this project provides a method overview for the task of Font Generation. We have a few observations during the development:Start from simple fonts. We observe that simple fonts such as sans serif are easier to generate and manipulate than highly stylized ones such as handwriting. However, in the typography market, these simple fonts are on the highest demand. Therefore instead of focusing on generating fonts with crazy styles, we can work on producing production-grade simple fonts that improve readability.Data is crucial. A utopian vision is to learn the font manifold and produce open-source industrial-grade fonts to everyone. However, to learn this model, it is always good to get more data, especially for the highly stylized fonts. With more typographers contributing to open-source fonts, we can achieve this goal earlier.Vector paths is a visual representation worth looking into. This is not only important for the task for Font Generation, but for a resolution-independent representation for computer vision in general, such as image segmentation, data annotation, and art creation. ', 'A better interface and clear functionalities. To make the interface friendly to the general public, we need to restructure the UI and list the functionalities more clearly.Get more data. Currently, we have the entire dataset of Google Fonts, but we need to get more data with valid licenses.Investigate the representation of vector paths.

Inadequate training and information has been  hindering the implementation of the new curriculum, as most teachers teachers have said. There has been criticism that  the Government has been focusing  on training only teachers employed by the Teachers Service Commission (TSC).The truth is that given the huge number of learners, most teachers in lower primary are employed by parents. This locks them out yet they are the ones to teach the new system. There has been much emphasis on digital learning yet there has been no adequate equipment to deliver  it. Taking an example as a teacher You teach for 10 minutes and you are told to play a video but you realize you have no decoder and or even the video itself. On the other hand In the private sector, school managers are forced to pay Sh7,000 per teacher for the training. They also buy books. The postponement of the new curriculum, means to financial losses. However there is a gap that Hamaisha platform comes in, according to the Deputy President William Ruto more than 700,000 Class One pupils out of 1.2 million have received tablet computers under the digital literacy programme. Inaddition to that , Jomo Kenyatta University of Science and Technology (JKUAT) had partnered with Kenya Private School Association (Kepsa) to ensure private institutions also benefit from the laptops project.The deal with JKUAT will see the university manufacture about four million devices for the next three years at a fixed price of Sh15, 000 per device.The devices will be distributed to over 11,000 private schools throughout the country and are expected to benefit over 1.8 million pupils.Irregardless of this tablets and laptops, there has not been a clear way to inculcate learning materials of the new curriculum into the tablets and laptops. Also there has been no proper, easier and cheaper way to train the teachers and also incorporate parents in implementing the new curriculum. Hamaisha is a swahili name meaning derived from the word Kuhamaisha meaning inspire with a goal to help solve these problems through a digital platform.

"Magnetic Fish Spectacular!","bigger, crazier, electronic version of an old childhood game","[6179, 'Was going toy shopping, as one does, when I walked by this old childhood game. A feeling of nostalgia swept over me as I remembered catching the little fishes with the tiny rod that is more fit for hamsters than humans. Suddenly I imagined what if this were more adult sized, how funny would that be? Now here we are, making it happen. Or at least trying to :) ', ""It's a wooden platform with holes containing fish inside that spins around inside a kid swimming pool via a motor. The fish have RFID cards inside with magnets. The rods use magnets to catch the fish. Each rod will have the ability to detect which fish was caught and how many points it was worth. "", 'THE FISH6 total that sit inside the holes of the wooden platform.Each fish was made out of 2 mixing bowls. One slightly bigger than the other, so that the top half bowl can swivel over the bottom bowl when the fish opens and closes its mouth. The top bowl is connected to the bottom with a wooden dowel and twisty ties. The top fin is made out of hard foam we found at AxMan. The hard foam fin was screwed in to the top half bowl and the googly eyes were glued on using E6000. We gave each fish a unique look with a sharpie marker and googly eyes. Inside the bottom bowl of the fish, we sanded the surface down and then used E6000 to attach two ceramic magnets, followed by an RFID card, and topped with another two ceramic magnets. The only piece inside the fish that is glued down is the first magnet since we wanted people to be able to easily remove the fish from the rod once caught.THE SMART FISHING RODThe tip of the rod contains an RFID sensor with two magnets in the middle (taped together) and that is wired all the way up the line and down the rod that will connect to the teensy inside the box located near the base of the rod. This wire is secured with zip ties along the way.The tip of the rod has the top half of a 3 inch diameter plastic Easter egg to hide the RFID sensor and was meant resemble the cartoonish design of the tiny rods from the original game. A positive side effect of this is that it makes the game a little more challenging because you have to angle the rod and have it timed just right in order to catch the fish.The fishing line is made out of colorful paracord that has its ends singed off with fire.Each rod is created using a wooden dowel attached to a foam sword handle.Towards the base of the rod will be a container holding all the circuitry and components of the smart fishing rod. We will be putting all the components together inside this container, the day of the hackathon. Each container will have the following: an RFID sensor board, an OLED screen, a 2 ohm speaker, an MPU (gyroscope/accelerometer), a teensy with prop shield, and a 5V battery pack.THE PLATFORMA circular wooden platform that is approximately 4 ft in diameter, that fits inside the kid swimming pool.There are 6 holes in the wooden platform for sitting the fish inside. The rim of the bottom bowl for each fish sits perfectly inside each hole.There are four wheels mounted to the bottom and located towards the outside of the platform, one in each quadrant of the circle if you were to divide it into four equal parts.The motor will drive a spinning wheel under the edge of the platform that will hopefully rotate the platform smoothly.There is a hinge installed going down the middle of the wooden platform to allow for folding up of the circular wooden platform into two halves. It is divided in such a way that 3 wheels are under one half of the platform and a single wheel is under the other half of the platform. This is to allow for easier transportation.THE MOTORA hole will be made on the side of the kid swimming pool to affix the spinning driver wheel on the inside and attach it to the motor on the outside. We will test out the motor for the first time, find the right speed to play the game at, and make a control station for the motor all on the the day of the hackathon. THE INCLINING BASEFour incline wood pieces attached to a wooden pegboard with nuts and bolts.Fits under the center of the pool, had to be elevated by 2 foam sheets underneath. This helps give the fish the extra height so their mouths will fall open wider, making them easier to catch when they are on the tallest part of the incline.We will need to affix the center of the inclining base to the center of the pool the day of the hackathon to keep the inclining base from sliding around and getting caught underneath the wheels.  ', ""The most challenging aspect was thinking up the whole design of the fish and the platform, as well as thinking of what is the catch a fish condition. We ended up sticking to the engineering design of the original fish game (inclines underneath the platform lining up under some of the holes), just bigger in size. The RFID sensor reads the RFID card even when it's 2 inches away, so we needed to think of another aspect we could test for in order to detect whether someone caught a fish. In the end, we decided the win condition should be a mixture of reading the RFID code while the rod position has changed significantly to show they are still holding onto the fish while it's up in the air.

"X-Terminator Drone","Reflecting UV light off of aluminum-coated propellers of an autonomous drone can inactivate deadly viruses.","[8228, 'Spurred by wanting to find a hack that bridged each of our specialties (optical sciences, biomedical engineering, and computer science) in addition to the recent Ebola outbreak and epidemics in general, the X-Terminator Drone was born. This hack aims to reduce the risk of healthcare workers and volunteers in the face of an epidemic by using drones to UV sterilize the field.  ', 'The X-Terminator Drone uses UV light that is reflected off of sputter-coated aluminum propeller blades to inactivate viruses (by irreversibly damaging its genetic material), making them no longer deadly and unable to replicate. The ultimate application of this hack is for healthcare facilities and patient clinics to be sterilized of harmful pathogenic diseases without need for human contact with deadly viruses and pathogens. High-risk areas can be first sanitized by a drone prior to human contact. ', 'To automate the Parrot AR Drone 2.0 Elite, an Arduino Uno connected to multiple ultrasonic distance sensors was connected to the drone. Each propeller blade was sputter-coated with aluminum metal (~50nm thick) to reflect UV light. A UV light source was mounted under each propeller blade at an ideal distance from the blade to best reflect the UV light below the drone (the physics is explained on our website). Finally, the drone itself was programmed to autonomously roam a room via feedback from its distance sensors mounted in each direction, at an altitude permitting UV inactivation of viruses and pathogens.  ', ""This was a very technical hack that involved many endless hours of troubleshooting, especially since none of us had done many of the technical hardware and software hacks involved. We were new to the Arduino and drones, as well as how to build the circuits we needed. This hack first involved identifying multiple UV light sources, of which we went through a couple LED light options before our final solution. Along the way, we encountered faulty hardware, and our procedure of soldering and connecting our initial ideal higher-powered UV LED lights resulted in their electrical failure. We then had to improvise and go with another set of different LED lights that were in the UV spectrum. Next, there is little documentation of hacking a Parrot Drone with an Arduino that combines all of the endpoints we included in our hack. Beginning with wiring the circuitry on breadboards to connect multiple distance sensors to the Arduino, we encountered issues with the readout and responses that we had to troubleshoot. Part of the issues were related to the voltage, and we eventually figured this out. Next, there were differences in Drone pinouts than what was posted online, we had to identify through voltage drops and differences the functions of the pinouts, and then connect the drone to the Arduino. For many hours, we were only able to connect successfully the computer to the Arduino and receive proper printouts from the sensors, and not from the Arduino to the drone. To solve this issue, we had to seek some advice on matching the voltages between our various types of hardware in order for all of our code, hardware and sensors to communicate. Based off of the advice and feedback we received, and online forums, we put together a level converter to divide voltage that allowed communication between the sensors, drone, and Arduino to finally happen (BUT, not before we faced a malfunctioning Arduino, and after using a fresh one we figured out that this had been the problem for a couple hours). Next, we had to weigh all the components and shave off any excess weight-- considering a second voltage divider to draw less energy. After that, we had to figure out the actual hardware and mechanical mounting of the LED lights. The next challenge was consolidating all of our multiple circuits into one small and lightweight board. Then finally, we wanted to command the flight of the drone to be similar to an iRoomba vacuum. We wrote javascript to automate the this type of room sweep via drone flight movements. This was one of the toughest hacks, as it was not clear in any instructional references we could find how to actually control the drone via the Arduino while using the sensors. We spent at least a full 16 hours on trying to get the communications between the devices working. Finally, we succeeded in reflecting UV light off our of drone propellers at the end, which allowed us to consider our hack a proof-of-concept for use during an epidemic. Accomplishments that we are proud ofThe amazing collaborative teamwork and the fact my team worked together non-stop to make this happen! What an incredible effort, especially given that none of us have done much of the things we had to figure out for this hackathon. We each learned how to integrate and utilize new hardware, software components and languages, and had to draw from past science classes as far back as high school for the scientific concepts.What we learnedMany many things, already alluded to in the challenges section... mostly along the lines of working with new hardware, circuits, writing Arduino code, working with Arduino libraries, interfacing multiple technologies, hacking a drone, new/unfamiliar coding languages, etc. What's next for X-Terminator DroneTrying to find the support to turn this drone into a reality where it can be utilized out in the field.

We wanted to make a real-time head-to-head soccer that worked well with multitouch controls. ', ""Astro League is a soccer game, where players attempt to score goals by firing projectiles into the footballs in order to knock them in the right direction. The game uses custom gestures to control the firing of projectiles and the placing of 'blocker' walls, which allow a player to temporary block the path of oncoming balls. Projectiles are constrained by an ammo counter that re-fills over time, encouraging accuracy over the bullet-spam approach, although depending on the situation sometimes both work. This is a desktop Windows app that integrates with the Lenovo Aura interface. "", ""The game was developed mainly in C# using the Unity 3D engine. Most of the effort went into the custom gesture recognition and visual effects. The gestures were coded based on the raw input data from Unity's API. Whilst Unity goes a long way to help with regards to rendering, we put quite a bit of time into the custom shaders: the burnup dissolve effect of the asteroids and the convolution pixel shader ripples. Unity's own physics and mesh colliders meant that the game object interactions were mostly fairly simple to implement, meaning we had time for some polish in the competition schedule. "", ""The two main challenges we faced were performance and the integration of a touch library. I had a fantastic old multitouch library I intended on re-using, but this was not compatible with Unity's window handle, so I had to re-create it based on Unity's API. It was the first time we've hit performance issues since learning Unity, so we had to familiarise ourselves with Unity's profiling tools and in particular how Unity batches draw calls. "", ""It's always good to hit a deadline. We had some unexpected things come up and get in the way of development, but we managed to compromise on some features as appropriate to balance both getting it done and to a good standard.We're especially proud of our first custom shaders in a Unity game. Modern devices have fantastic graphics capabilities, so it's great to be able to show them off. "", 'The major learning points on this project were convolution shaders, Unity performance optimisation and the Unity touch API. ', ""Right now we have a solid little game. The next step is to let people play it and get some feedback.

"Median ","A messaging app for centralized narrative communication in a dyanamic healthcare environment.","[3592, 'The medical care industry has lacked a homogenous system for patient data tracking since the dawn of the digital era. Patients are required to repetitively fill out paperwork that details their health status every single step of the way through patient care. Whether it be a health clinic, the hospital emergency room, or a healthcare specialist, data needs to be entered and re-entered into a new system; a system that is disconnected from its counterparts, leaving both patients and professionals at the mercy of these tedious practices, instead of focusing their attention and effort to patient care. Even within a single hospital unit, patient data needs to be communicated in real-time to multiple parties, especially in intensive-care situations. Median works to get everyone: the patient, doctors, nurses, specialists on the same page and allows for the documentation of patient data in a way that is focused and allows for optimal patient care.

"Speaking Email - voice reader for email","a mobile app that reads your email out loud, with low distraction UX","[3674, ""I get lots of email and need to be up to date. Commute time is not used as well as it could be. If I could listen to my email while driving or sitting in traffic I could think about what I need to do and formulate what I need to go back to people with. This is what started my search for an app that would read out my email for me that was distraction free and could be used safely while driving. My search resulted in a realisation there was a big hole waiting to be filled by Speaking Email. How it worksThis app is basically an email program combined with speech synthesis. The email technology used is Context.IO and Gmail REST API. We render inline images and scale down fixed width elements to a mobile form factor using javascript and css. The app is built using html5 with Cordova. Users can swipe between emails and perform limited actions (archive, flag, quick reply, pause), intended to be easy to use and distraction free while driving. Texting and driving is a big issue and we've placed a lot of emphasis on driving safety, making sure there are no complex interactions. Your emails can be continuously spoken, meaning you never need to look at or touch the phone.Challenges I ran intoWe tried doing voice recognition and I learned heaps about phonemes and how that all works, but we came to a dead end and realise we needed to rewrite and use a different library so had to pause on that. I'm keen to get back to it but need to pace ourselves due to too much to do. Mobile development on Cordova using Windows has been difficult due to debugging tools being a bit faky and general slow code-debug-run cycle that you get with the build process. Emails are difficult to process with the many complex formats in the wild.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofGetting hot swapping of cordova code working for super fast dev-run cycle was great - annoying that we had to spend so long on tooling but good to manage to get it working well. Layout of emails using css and javascript was much tricker and ultimately rewarding than we expected. Making a cordova plugin using objective C was a good accomplishment. Getting our first app in the App Store just over a month ago was an exciting moment!!What I learnedLearned a lot more about email. I thought I knew a lot already, like how inline attached emails and CIDs work, but turned out there was a bit more to it with iPhone emails being multipart mixed and still containing inline images. With gmail api you have to compose messages in raw format - base 64 with mime boundaries which I've never had to do in 20 years of programming! What's next for Speaking EmailWe've just pushed a new version to the App Store, now supporting Gmail, Outlook.com, Yahoo! Mail, iCloud, or any IMAP mail server. We've also built in more customisation of how you manage your email (eg mark as read or move to folder instead of archive).

This gives customers the ability to fine tune and learn from the cards that performed best and make adjustments to their cards in the future to get better results each time. ', 'I built RokkSalt using the Laravel PHP framework and using a MySQL database to store information. I used the Infusionsoft API and the oAuth authentication method to allow users to connect to their Infusionsoft Application.

Listen to music while commuting?We're guessing you have.

Everyday distractions like crying babies and noisy neighbors hinder your productivity, your patience, and the sick fiya you're dropping in your playlist -- but they no longer need to be sources of stress.What it DoesUsing the built in microphone on your Mac OS X device, f.low is able to detect how loud your environment is and dynamically adjust your volume on-the-fly, keeping your listening experience consistent.Mapping microphone input power to decibel values using our fitting algorithm, as well as letting you set a maximum and minimum volume for f.low to work with, we achieve the sound you want, all the time.How We Built Itf.low is currently available on Mac OS X, and it's just a quick and easy port away from iOS.

"ZenPRM","Making Healthcare administration amazingly simple","[4873, 'The idea was born because we’ve solved similar problems for Hospital Systems, IPAs, ACOs and HIEs over the years. We started to see a lot of commonality in what they we’re collecting. Then when we got involved in NYS DSRIP, TCPI grants, etc. and it became apparent that the number of requirements were growing and getting more complex. Most importantly, we started to see providers and organizations participating in overlapping programs that needed to collect a lot of the same things from a lot of the same people. It was clear there was an issue here, so we built ZenPRM to go after it.   ', 'ZenPRM starts with the Collaborative Profile. This represents the basic demographic information about your participants\u200a—\u200aWho are they? What do they do? Where do they do it? Who do they work with? Etc. These are facts about the resources and not competitive secrets\u200a—\u200astuff that you’ll painstakingly curate and then put on the provider search on your web site. All of our customers and the participants themselves will work together to keep this information up-to-date. It ends up being a complete directory of the healthcare community you’re operating in and it’s not all on you to keep it updated. For the purposes of this challenge, we’re using the advanced search capabilities to find referral paths for patients at discharge.  One of the top predictors for hospital readmissions is whether or not the patient had an appropriate follow-up with their physician after discharge.

"PowerGlove 2.0","Get your power back","[2385, ""The inspiration for this project started from an idea for a virtual reality glove. The glove was going to be able to give feedback by using servos and wires to stop the hand from closing. Because we weren't familiar with developing through the Oculus Rift, we ventured to find other uses for this technology. We took a health approach after we realized that the glove could be used to help people who suffer from arthritis. We modified our original idea so that instead of  stopping the user from closing their hand, it records data about the movement of each finger.How it worksThe PowerGlove works by using flex sensors to measure the deflection of each finger. The data gets wirelessly transmitted to a computer which will analyze the raw data, filter through the invalid measurements, and store the data on a database. A common method physicians and doctors recommend for patients with arthritis do deal with their pain is simple hand and finger exercises. We have created a web app that walks through these exercises with the patient and records if the user can complete them. Challenges we ran intoSome challenges we ran into were figuring out how to communicate between the glove and the web server; finding how to wire the glove so that each movement could intrusively be measured with maximum accuracy.What I learnedWe learned about arthritis and the research going on being the condition; how to read from a serial port, parse the data, and write to a MySql database; and advanced soldering techniques.

These suggestions act as probable topics of interests that potentially serve as valuable points of reference to the user. ', 'The web application relies primarily on the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to asynchronously transcribe audio to text while also storing the timestamp of each word. This data is stored in a Python Dictionary with the words acting as keys and a list of timestamps of the word’s occurrence as the value.. To construct the relevant suggestions that the program offers, the Google Cloud Natural Language Processing API is used to identify words from the audio with high levels of “salience.” Promoting words with higher salience over sheer frequency, we prevent the inclusion of filler or common words.APIs UsedGoogle Cloud SpeechGoogle Cloud StorageGoogle Cloud DatastoreGoogle Cloud Natural LanguageGoogle Cloud  App EngineThe front-end is two styled HTML pages, one where the user can upload a file and one where the user can see the results. When the user uploads a file, we store it in the Google Cloud Storage Datastore using an API call. A python endpoint on our Flask server (described below) then processes the audio file and returns a list of keywords and a dictionary mapping each word to a list of its start times in the audio. Next, when the user tries to search for a specific word in the audio, the program will retrieve a list containing the start times of that word in the audio and allow the user to toggle between each one, very similar to the “command-F” functionality. ', 'Although the NL API provides salience scores, some manipulations had to take place in order to make them useable. While working with the API, we were faced with the decision of whether or not to remove stopwords from the text. Stopwords are short words such as “the, at, on” which provide no real significance to the meaning of the sentence. Many NLP algorithms remove stop words to better analyze phrases.For our project, we run the NL API on two sets of the audio transcripts: one containing stopwords and one with stopwords removed. This is because, as we were testing our algorithm, we noticed the API produced significantly different results for keywords depending on whether stop words were included. Since we believed both runs had useful outputs, our final output for salience takes the top five salient words from both algorithms combined. ', 'We successfully built an application that solved a tangible issue we found. With little to no experience with APIs, we were proud to be able to create a working product using three of the Google Cloud APIs.Flask server and connectQuery Cloud datastoreDeploy first Google App Engine ', 'Over the course of 36 hours, our skills improved dramatically. We learned how to build the entire pipeline starting with creating a Google Cloud account to deploying the finished product on the Google App Engine. We also learned how to build a full stack application and integrate the front-end and back-end into a working application. Additionally, we learned how to implement control flow in HTML using Jinja2. ', 'One functionality we wanted to implement but didn’t have time for was built-in sound file conversion. Currently, our program only works with .flac files and we have to run two shell commands on any other sound type file to get it to fit our requirements. Our goal for the future is to be able to call these shell commands from within the program after the user uploads a file before it is sent to the cloud storage.We are also hoping for embedded YouTube video functionality. Instead of uploading a sound file, the user can paste a link to a YouTube video. Our software would extract the audio and process it and allow the user to essentially search the video for the word they want.Finally, our current implementation only allows for single-word search in the audio file. A relatively simple but largely helpful update would be to allow the user to search for phrases within the audio.

"WiFi Helper","Share WiFi Credentials with your guests via Alexa by showing a QR Code on Echo Show or dictating it by an Echo (dot).","[9825, 'I wrote an iOS App to share the WiFi Credentials via QR Code back in the Days of iOS 10 when it was not build-in. It does not only scan those QR Codes, it creates them and managed multiple credentials. After incorporating different technologies inside the Apple ecosystem for sharing (NFC, AirPlay, iMessage, AppleWatch), it was natural for me to build a companion skill to share the WiFi settings via Alexa. Especially the Echo Show is predestined to show the QR Code to guests. The device is always hat the location of the WiFi, while I might be away with my iPhone, when my wife wants to share your wifi with guests.But a problem e.g. on parties is, that the shown QR Code disappears after a short time - this updates brings infinite displaying the Credentials. ', 'First of all, the Skill stores the WiFi credentials.There a three options to accomplish this:I) Voice OnlyBy invoking the e.g. ""set credentials"" the skill asks for the length of the WiFi Name. Then it ask for each character separately. After the last character for the WiFi Name ii asks for the length of the WiFi Passwort and then again asks for each character separately. A character answer could be:XS: only character (this might be error-prone think about m vs. n etc.) and will be interpreted as a capital characterS: the numberM: a word and the beginning character will be used as a capital characterL: ""small"" followed by a character (same as 1, but the character will be used small)L: ""large"" followed by a character (same as 1)XL: ""small"" followed by a word (same as 3, but the character will be used small)XL: ""large"" followed by a word (same as 3)XXL: ""digit"" followed by a number (same as 2)XXXL: ""special character"" followed by the name of the special character, which should be used.II) Webpage SupportIf you ask for ""connection code"" three options bring you to a website:voice only: Alexa tells you the link ""alexa.wifi.properties"" and a user specific 6 digit code, which is valid for 15 minutes. The URL leads to a webpage, where the user enters the 6 digits and if correct, a page is presented, with two fields (name and password).card: The URL (""alexa.wifi.properties"") and 6 digits are noted on a card in the Alexa App. The card also presents a qr code, wich is a link. This link directs the user directly (skipping the page for the digit code) to the page to enter the credentials .display: On an Echo Show the QR Code, URL (""alexa.wifi.properties"") and the 6 digits are also presented on the screen.III) iOS AppAs described in ""Inspiration"" I have a companion App. This app manages WiFi Credentials. If you ask the skill for the ""iPhone App"" it will give you the URL ""http://wifi.properties"" where you can find the link to the App in the Apple App Store. On the card and an Echo Show or. Spot Display it also presents a QR Code wich will directly open the App in the App Store App.If you have the App installed, you can send any stored credentials directly to the skill. Therefore the app needs to know the Alexa UserID for invoking my Webservice - like the website (see II above). So the app extends the functionality of the ""connection code"" intent and offers different ways of integrating it:You can enter the 6 digit code in a special form inside the app, the app receives the Alexa UserID from a web service and stores it locally. You can scan the QR Code inside a special form inside the app and the app extracts the Alexa UserID directly.Both forms are special, because the user gets a special hint how to invoke the skill via a speech bubble image.The Link coded in the QR Code is registered as Universal link, if it is scanned by the iOS Camera App or the URL is entered in the Safari App, my App gets invoked and directly extract the Alexa UserID.After the Skill backend has stored the WiFi Credentials for a User, it can present thoseThe user can ask for the credential set or for a specific attribute:SSID and Password (""Alexa ask Wifi Helper for the credentials"")SSID (""Alexa ask WiFi Helper for the WiFi Name"")Password (""Alexa ask WiFi Helper for the password"")The skill spells every character in detail (like small a large b special character Dollar Digit one ...). Additionally they are also shown on a Card in the Alexa App. In the credential case, the card also includes a QR Code with the WiFi Credentials, so that it can be scanned directly.On an Echo Show and an Echo Spot the Display is used, to present the written representation of the Card and in the credential case also the QR Code.On an Echo Show or an Echo Spot the skill ask to present the QR Code infinite. If yes, an audio directive starts a silent audio stream and presents the QR Code as cover image, and the credentials as meta data text. The stream restarts after 2 1/2 minutes by adding those data to the play list. The skill uses a unique toke each time, so that it will reload the credentials if they are changed in-between. The user can directly invoke this infinite presentation by asking alexa to ""... start WiFi Helper and show credentials permanently"". The best user experience of this skill is using an Echo Show, connecting the skill to the iOS App for easy credential input and showing the credentials to guest on the Echo Show, which then uses their Smart phone (even without my App) to scan the wifi credentials QR Code and automatically get access to the WiFi. ', ""The skill Backend runs on a php server. The script uses the Alexa UserID (hashed) to create an entry in a MySQL database to store the WiFi's SSID and Password. There are different kind of scripts running on the server processing those data:Skill (plain JSON parsing and creating via PHP - just minimal code, no framework, yet)QR Code Generating (using the PHP QR Code lib) used by Skill for displaying WiFi Credentials on Display / Card or the (deep)link to the webpage.Website (just some HTML,CSS and PHP code) for browser use (also supporting universal links to deep-link into the iOS app if installed).WebServices (just some PHP code) to communicate with the AppThe iOS App is written in Swift an only uses default Frameworks of apple. For the Skill this app is extended by an upper top-left skill button in the navigation bar. This invokes an menu with the options:Enabling the skill: If Alexa app is installed, a deep link is called. Otherwise a link to the amazon skill store is invoked).Connecting via QR: Start scanner for Connection Code. On the camera image, there is a speech bubble overlay, which shows the phrase how to get the connection code from an echo show.Connection via PIN: Speech bubble, which shows the phrase how to get the PIN from an echo and a form to enter itDelete connection (if there is an active one).If an Alexa UserID is linked by QR Code or PIN, the credential detail view presents a switch. If the switch gets activated, the credentials are transferred to the WebService. On the Overview View, the credential wich is stored on the skill is marked by a grey Alexa Skill icon. "", 'The Display of the Spot created some challenges:The Display is round, so the normal QR Code would lose the corners and so the scanner could not recognize it. Solution: Added an additional boarder to avoid losing the three orientation squares.The shown text is presented over the QR Code on the Spot, so some informations are lost and the scanner sometimes cannot read the data. Solution: While generating the QR Code I use the highest quality which added redundancy so that the lose of some information can be restored. Additionally I shortend the shown text to the minimum, so less information is lost. Both solutions reduces the comeliness on an Echo Show. But it is not possible to distinguish both devices, neither by the Intent request nor by the HTTP Request of the image itself.Adapting the audio player interface to the infinity image presentation hack. This means, only using it, when display is present and some additional intents to handle stoping etc. correctly. ', 'Multiple ways for the user to enter the credentials, so that he can chose the one wich suits best for her/him.VoiceOnly option for dictation of the SSID and Passwords, which usually mix small and capital letters as well as special characters and digits.The idea to quickly adapt the new audio player meta to make infinite presentation of the QR Code by presenting it as a cover image of a silent audio file. ', 'How to build an easy dialog with short interactions while offering options to handle more specific options (like the any character / word for small characters). There fore you need to handle the context, otherwise you can not distinguish a single digit as an intent to specify the length of the SSID or Password or a Digit within those (not handling this well, lead to a bad review in the beginning of the skill).

However, without the specific street knowledge gained from experience living in Boston, safety can be an issue not just for us but for the general populace as well.Our VisionWe hope to create an app that gathers data from police databases and utilizes historical data to display a heatmap of criminal activity in Boston. This app will then recommend safer areas for foot traffic and provide actual navigation instructions, avoiding areas of highly concentrated violent crime and drug related activities.Our ProcessWe scraped Boston Police arrest databases and gathered a dataset. Then, we utilized a deep neural network to create a model for geospatial crime frequency data, learning to predict the relative safety of a given area. The neutral network then evaluated the data on a variety of different locations in Boston and created a custom heatmap, which we then turned into a custom Google Maps overlay.ChallengesOur initial problem was the lack of uniformity in data structure between the variety of databases we scraped, forcing us to fallback on an amount of manual re-formatting and sorting. While there were optimization issues with the machine learning model, those were related to simple hyperparameter tuning and were overcome. The primary stumbling point was properly overlaying the crime data on the Maps rendering.

"Augmented Decision Making ","A platform that offers a fair framework for decision making process by empowering individuals ","[3571, ""Social choice has received considerable attention in AI and computer science in recent years, due to technological advances that have facilitated an explosion in the availability of ranking or preference data.Despite a great degree of personalization in recommendations and information provision, tailoring alternatives presented to specific users can be difficult for a number of reasons, including infeasibility of complete personalization. Most decisions force the choice of a single option , usually from a range of choices that maximise customer satisfaction across a target market. In such settings, a single “consensus” recommendation is made for the population as a whole.In social choice theory, the Arrow's theorem states that when voters have three or more distinct alternatives , no ranked voting electoral system can convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide ranking while also meeting a specified set of criteria: unrestricted domain, non-dictatorship, Pareto efficiency, and independence of irrelevant alternativesThe proposed alternative is using a modern voting system so as to satisfy as many criteria as possible, while considering the participatory democracy concept: involving users in the decision making process and focusing on their participation and collaboration "", 'Our platform offers users a middle ground between fully personalised choices and pure consensus recommendations in the process of decision making.The platform is an integrated part of the Mirro product and aims to benefit organisations by empowering individual employees in the fair-decision making process implied by a participatory democracy: problem identificationdebate , ideation and co-creationdrafting proposalsvoting checking that the solution has been properly deployed and actually solves the identified problem.The process aims to determine a collection of candidates that best represent the “collective interests” of the voters, by using a modern voting system, selectable by problem authors when defining the problem.

"LiveBus","Crowd-Sourced location sharing platform to provide accurate public transport location data to users","[4187, 'Public transport systems have many struggles. But for most, the biggest struggle is the uncertainty behind not having accurate information location on how far their next bus is. While some systems do implement their own GPS tracking systems, this would need a different bus app to be downloaded for each system and most systems do not even have GPS tracking. As students we use buses to get around campus all the time and need accurate location data to know whether it will come in time for class. Hence we created LiveBus to solve a widespread struggle for all Public Transport users. ', ""LiveBus utilised the powerful here.com api to load the map as well as automatically fetch the bus routes in the city based on the user's current location. The app then allows the user to select a specific bus route and see the next bus based on crowd sourced data. They will also see the path that the bus is taking to reach the user. When the bus finally arrives, the user can instantly board the bus and act as a tracker for others to see until they get off their next stop. The app checks for clusters of trackers so that the user waiting at the bus station can understand the reliability of the location data. The trackers can also indicate how crowded the bus is. Lastly the app acts sets up a medium of communication between those on the bus and those waiting to allow those waiting on the bus to get information about the status of the bus in case it has broken down or is stuck in a traffic jam.  "", ""The core of the app powerfully uses the here.com api to power the map as well as all the routes and bus stations. Then, using the web-geolocation api, we added the user's live location to the map gotten from here.com. Google cloud was used for data storage and vue.js was used to implement material design to make the UI look good and simple the use. Many web services then complemented the app to power the backend to connect the trackers with those waiting for the bus station.  "", 'One of the conceptual challenges was in whether the users would track the bus for others.

A virtual dance pad sits at your feet, and vive trackers help bring your feet into the virtual world to dance. Keeping to the tried and true DDR style, the steps the player must take come from the bottom of a virtual screen and mark the timing needed for each move.

We used two vive trackers along with custom built straps to securely fasten the trackers to the feet.

Finally, we used Unity's UI system to create the visuals and built our own parsers to read in our song data and present the visual steps to our players. "", ""Since we needed to make a song data encoding system from scratch, there needed to be a lot of prior design work to be done before any code could be written. A significant issue was figuring out how to take in the song data, and then put out the steps at the correct time, and then taking in the player's inputs to hit the spawned steps. It ended up being a very complex system that took hours to debug at one point. In addition, we used Unity Collaborate as a version control and repository system, which sometimes would overwrite one of our changes, forcing us to do the same changes again. "", ""We're very proud that the game we made ended up very much like the DDR feeling we were going for.

From the start we came up with a plan to divide work, but as parts started to come together, the pace slowed down, and we needed to keep going to finish our game.

Each template card bears the name of the list it is associated with.Why use checklist templates?For users:Checklists are added only when needed as the card moves in the processNew checklists are added on top and clearly show the required actionsFor process designers:Templates can be stored in the board or grouped in a separate boardIt is a great way to setup and document your processChanges are available immediatelyWhy automate actions when an item is checked?For users:It is simpler than using the move or archive card buttonsNo need to think about what to do nextFor process designers:You can easily embed some process logic in the cards and avoid using Zapier integrationsIt works when items are checked via the APIScreenshot 2: When a card is created in the Inbox list, the bot automatically adds the Inbox checklist. Actions such as move, archive card or add label are availableWhy call it a bot?Automatic actions are performed by the Trello user who authorized the Checklist bot power-up.Once properly configured, the ""bot"" acts in the background until desactived.How do templates work?A checklist template is simply a card bearing the name of a list and containing one or more checklists.Card templates are usually stored in a list containing all the templates associated a board.Once you\'ve told Checklist Bot where to look for the template you are all set.How do you program the bot actions?Checklist Bot detects actions after the keyword -> in text associated to checklist items.The following actions can be detected and launched:ActionDescriptionSyntaxlistMove the card to a list-> list(listName, position)listName: name of the target listposition (optional): location in the list the card will move.

Any unauthorized access to a board or an action will simply be discarded.When the user grants the authorization, the token is stored in the private settings of the power-up and is not available to other users on the client side.An open-source projectChecklist Bot Power-Up  is an internship project of Louis Jeckel.The code is open-source and available on Github and GlitchWe have chosen to open-source it for many reasons:use it as a source of education for other students and prosgive visibility to Louis (who\'s looking for an internship next summer in Southern California) and to OCTO Technologyhelp detect and solve potential security leaksWe welcome future contributors.

The glasses vibrate when your eyes close for too long, and also causes your Pebble watch to vibrate. How it was builtDigitalCoffee was built with an arduino, photon, pebble, and android phone. The arduino processes all of the information, and the photon uploads the information to a server. The server sends data to your phone, which in turn forwards the data via bluetooth to the pebble. The IR sensors detect eye movement - blink frequency and duration. There is also a tilt sensor to detect head motion. The vibration motors trigger as long as the sensors detect signs of sleeping. The blink information is forwarded to the phone app for analytics; one can see when he/she is most sleepy. Lastly, the pebble app displays raw values and alerts you via vibration/notification.The glasses were designed and 3d printed. We used multiple breadboards, wires, and parts to do everything. Also included: a button to calibrate the IR sensors.Challenges we ran intoGetting all the hardware to work properly. The biggest challenge was getting the photon to accept and transmit data from the Arduino Uno. We ran into some serious problems with transmission using RX and TX pins, but we were able to use I2C instead. It would have been much harder without Pennapps' great mentors. The hardware was also hard to calibrate as there were multiple issues with sensitivity. What's next?Minimizing the cables, making the entire module more wireless/light, more analytics and information, various smart options controlled via blinking.

"Tunnel Comet","pass through like comet goes","[6118, ""The Hsuehshan Tunnel is the main artery between Taipei and Yilan, but it can be severely clogged. After researching, our team found there are two main reasons that cause the traffic congestion in Hsuehshan Tunnel. One is there's no tool for drivers to measure interval from the front vehicle objectively. Drivers usually keep too long interval to avoid breaking the laws. It lead to decrease of car flow in Hsuehshan Tunnel. The other is some drivers driving at improper speed results in clogging up traffic behind them and decrease average driving speed. Hence, we try to design a system that can solve the problems and increase car flow and average driving speed in Hsuehshan Tunnel.雪山隧道是連結台北與宜蘭的主要幹道，但令人煩惱的是它常常有嚴重塞車的情形。經過研究後我們發現有兩個主要原因造成雪山隧道的交通壅塞，第一個是因為駕駛沒有客觀工具可以判斷和前車的車距，因此駕駛很容易為了不要觸法而拉長車距，而導致雪山隧道的單位時間車流量減少，另一個原因是有些駕駛會開在不適當的速度(烏龜車)，堵住了後方的車輛，導致後方所有車輛的平均車速降低。因此，我們想要設計一套系統來解決這些問題，提升雪山隧道內的單位時間車流量和平均車速。 "", 'Tunnel Comet provide visualized guides for drivers in Hsuehshan Tunnel to drive properly. It would base on the conditions around the vehicle and show appropriate visualized guide in front of the vehicle to suggest driver to accelerate, decelerate or maintain current speed. By guiding drivers driving at optimal speed and interval, Tunnel Comet leads to significant improvement in traffic. The efficiency is proved in simulation system.Since all vehicle would pass through the tunnel with visualized guide in front just like comet goes. Hence we named this system “Tunnel Comet”.雪隧彗星提供駕駛視覺導航，來幫助駕駛能更適當的行車。它會根據車輛附近的情況，在車輛前方提示出適當的視覺引導，來建議駕駛加速、減速或維持目前速度。藉由引導駕駛在最佳的速度和車距行車，雪隧彗星大幅改善了交通狀況，它的效益已在模擬系統中證實。由於所有的車輛在穿過隧道時，都會有視覺導航一直在前方，就像彗星要離去的樣貌，因此我們把這套系統命名為—雪隧彗星。 ', 'Simulation System:In the beginning, we try to prove the efficiency of Tunnel Comet. We built a simulation system in unity which has two-lane traffic in the tunnel. Both lane is simulated with AI cars running on it, while one lane is normal road and the other lane is Tunnel Comet road. Tunnel Comet road is setting up sensors to detect car pass through and light patterns to serve as visualized guides. By this design, user can carry out the comparison between normal road and Tunnel Comet road. Furthermore, the simulation system has two mode – God mode and player mode. In God mode, user can observe whole tunnel in god view and see the objective traffic statistics of each lane. In player mode, user can experience the driving in first person view and even VR(virtual reality) view if user has VR glasses. These two mode also allow us to make sure the strategy of Tunnel Comet is appropriate and the driving experience is comfortable.Prototype:After proving the efficiency of Tunnel Comet, we built a prototype of Tunnel Comet road. It contains four ultrasonic ranging modules and three LED lights to form a segment of road. We used an Arduino board to connect all components and implement same strategy algorithm as simulation system on it.模擬系統:首先，我們為了驗證雪隧彗星的效益，我們用Unity製作了一套模擬系統，裡面的隧道有雙線道，兩個線道都會人工智慧車輛在上面行駛，而兩個線道一個分別為普通道路，一個被製作為雪隧彗星道路，雪隧彗星道路設置了很多感測器來偵測通過車輛和特殊圖案來做為視覺導航，藉由這個設計，使用者可以清楚地對普通道路和雪隧彗星道路進行比較，此外，模擬系統有兩種模式，分別為上帝模式和玩家模式，在上帝模式，使用者可以以上帝視角觀察整個隧道，並且有兩個線道客觀的交通數據供審視，在玩家模式，使用者可以以第一人稱視角體驗行車，甚至若使用者有虛擬實境眼鏡，甚至可以虛擬實境視角體驗行車，這兩個模式讓我們可以確保雪隧彗星的策略是適當的，並且行車體驗是舒適的。硬體雛型:在驗證雪隧彗星的效益之後，我們製作了雪隧彗星道路的雛型，它由四個超音波測距模組和三個LED燈構成一段道路，我們用Arduino電路板統合這些組件，並在上面實作和模擬系統一樣的策略演算法。 ', ""Although the concept of Tunnel Comet is simple, but the appropriate guiding strategy must be well-designed. At first we found that too simple or sensitive design could cause Bullwhip effect in traffic. The guiding strategy must avoid providing improper acceleration and deceleration guides and should be capable of absorb Bullwhip effect. While designing the guiding strategy, we have to consider not only the interval but also the relative speed of the vehicles. Another challenge is how to design appropriate visualized guide patterns. Improper guide patterns design like not intuitive, too complicated or flashing would not only cause misunderstanding, but also lead to distraction and even dizziness.雖然雪隧彗星的概念很簡單，但實際上適當的導航策略需要很完善的設計，起初我們發現太簡單的設計或太敏感的設計都會造成交通狀況上的長鞭效應，導航策略必須避免不適當的引導加速和減速，並且要有能力吸收長鞭效應，因此在設計導航策略的時候，我們不只需要考量車距問題，還需要考量車輛彼此的相對速度。另一個挑戰是對於視覺導航圖形的設計，不適當的設計，例如不直覺、太複雜或閃爍等，除了可能造成誤解，還可能造成分心甚至暈眩。Accomplishments that we’re proud of1.Think up an excellent solution to improve the traffic in Hsuehshan Tunnel.2.Build a powerful simulation system which prove the efficiency of Tunnel Comet, and also serve as a perfect platform for us to test the guiding strategy and driving experience.3.Build a prototype with complete function by hardware component.4.Give this system a cool name – “Tunnel Comet”5.Work as perfect team and have a lot of fun1.發想出一個出色的解決方案來改善雪山隧道內的交通狀況。2.製作一套強大的模擬系統，驗證了雪隧彗星的效應，同時也作為一個完美的平台讓我們可以測試導航策略和行車體驗。3.製作一個功能齊全的硬體雛型。4.為這個系統取一個很酷的名字—“雪隧彗星”5.做為一個完美的團隊一起完成這項作品，並得到很多樂趣。What we learned1.Designing an excellent system requires comprehensive consideration in every detail.2.Knowledge about traffic congestion.3.Technique in developing system with Unity and Arduino1.設計一個出色的系統，需要在每個細節上的周全考量。2.關於交通壅塞的知識3.使用Unity和Arduino開發系統的技術What's next for Tunnel Comet1.Keep improving guiding strategy and visualized guide patterns design of Tunnel Comet.2.Apply the concept to urban traffic and develop other vehicle locating and guiding technology that can cooperate with current system.

"wells","Wells is a smart bottle cap that tracks your water intake, boosting your well-being one drop at a time.","[2742, 'wells is a brainchild of a group of friends from Imperial College London and UCL. Being passionate about innovations in health tech and quantified self, we were surprised by how little our increasingly health-conscious society knows about one of the key parts of lifestyle - water intake. Drinking enough water is essential for maintaining our health and overall well-being. However, many people either do not realize the importance of water intake or simply do not know how much they should drink. Dehydration can contribute to an array of medical complications. Drinking enough water helps a balanced body and mind, making hydration equally important for athletes, scholars and patients alike. ', 'wells consists of two components: the smart bottle cap fitting every standard PET bottle and a smartphone app. Using the wells app, user is provided with a recommended water intake for the day based on their personal metrics and current activity levels. The autonomous cap measures the amount of water that flows out through its seal and data is collected and displayed via the app. The user can see their progress and receive push notifications reminding them to follow the recommended intake.  ', ""The measurement is compromised by a specifically developed cap to suit every PET plastic bottle. In its inner canal an adapted mechanical turbine is located to provide data about speed of flow of liquid. The signal is being processed by a special System on a Chip that is able to track the speed of rotation of the turbine and thus the liquid and provide the output data via Bluetooth to a smartphone with a wells application. The whole system is powered by a battery that is wirelessly charged via Qi standards, that enables to store data in case of application and the cap being disconnected. The measurement is thus reliable, energy efficient and comfortable for the user.The wells website is available here and supporting code for the app can be found in the links below.What's next for wellsOur mission with wells is to improve your hydration via a simple, smart experience.

"SAN - Soil Analyzer Network","Simple, extendable, scalable monitoring solution","[6281, ""California is the largest economy in the United States, it accounts for more than 13% of its gross state product (GSP) and by itself it's comparable to the many countries of the world. Its agriculture is a very important, multibillion dollar sector that consists of more than 75 000 farms and ranches that have been hurt by the recent droughts. To help fight the droughts modern day farms use large irrigation systems with vast water requirements. Smart management of this precious resource is a must.Luckily, with today’s technologies we can hack the solution. "", 'The challenge is to help mitigate California\'s water crisis by using smart interconnected devices or with what is commonly known as Internet of Things. We have come up with a solution that optimizes water consumption of the irrigation systems with the goal to reduce overall strain on this precious resource.Our solution consists of two parts, low power soil moisture sensor probes that are scattered across the field, and cloud computing. By using a simple wireless communication protocol, probes aggregate information about certain sectors of the farm\'s soil and propagate information to Samsung Artik. There, the data is analyzed and used to control the irrigation system, while offering the farmer complete control and overview. Additionally, nodes are based on low power microcontroller that collects the data from capacitive moisture sensor. They are solar powered with battery backup. Data can be propagated from the farthest to the closets node by using a mesh networking algorithm. This setup allows us to build scalable solution which can be custom fitted for a wide range of cases.Our user interface is implemented by using Web 2.0 technologies.

"Smart Floating Farm","Cultivate the future, start from the sea","[9971, 'We want to help peopleWe see that local people in Coastal area and Remote Islands having difficulty in planting horticulture because they face the problem of land limitations. We have an idea about making floating platform so people can grow their vegetables at coastal area.We inspired by GROASIS, Seawater Greenhouse, and Hamster Ball-Shaped Solarball. They can grow plants at desert area and have a pure water using desalination process.Hopefully this platform can help local people to reduce their dependence on supply from mainland, help them make their own food independence and also help to make more money from selling the harvest vegetables. We also can manage these process with supllying seed, provide consultation to user, and preparing the market to sell the vegetables. ', 'SMART FLOATING FARM (SFF) PLATFORM BUILD TO RECORD, MONITOR, AND MAKE DECISION BASED ON THE RECORD.Initialize sensors and outputThis platform will initialize serial, lcd, RTC (real time clock), sensors, and motor. If RTC cannot be detected, LCD will display error and user must fix it. After RTC is ok, Arduino101 will check communication with ESP8266. Arduino101 send ""AT"" and wait ""OK"" from ESP8266.Get threshold from ServerAfter receiving ""OK"", Arduino will command ESP8266 as station mode and get parameter threshold from Server.  These threshold value used to ensure plants are in the range that has been determined by the user. SFF send GET method to server (This link used to receive sensors threshold). Parameter threshold will be saved as variable.Sensor MeasurementThis platform record these parameters : soil moisture & temperature, greenhouse temperature & humidity, greenhouse smoke detection, vibration, plant height, time, and light intensity.Sending Data to ServerData from sensor compiled as String and send it to Web by ESP8266 using POST method (Go to this link to send data to WebServer; Visit this link to see data that received by WebServer from Platform).Output ActionArduino101 check data measurement with threshold received from Server. Based on these threshold, platform will give command automatically to activate LED indicator, water pump, exhaust fan and LED lamps based on sensors reading. After 10 seconds, platform will delay few minutes before the next measurement. While waiting, Arduino101 measure gyro value.Smart Floating Farm DashboardUser can see data send to Server using this dashboard. This dashboard will give all information from sensor graphically. All data can be found at irwanrudy github repo.Smart Floating Farm Dashboard/GUI ', 'Google SketchUpGoogle SketchUp used to make the platform 3D design. We have made 3D model of Smart Floating Farm. We simplify our model for Intel hackathon.Smart Floating Farm 3D DesignWe make dashboard with HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. To add style we use Bootstrap and make interactive chart use Highcharts. We make it eye-catching for everyone that using the dashboard. FritzingFritzing used for the design of electronics hardware to support us in sensors configuration with Arduino101. We used internal and external libraries to make this visualization.Smart Floating Farm Sensors and Outputs Configuration-Fritzing designArduino IDEWe use Arduino IDE to built the firmware. We use libraries from internal Arduino IDE and from internet. For external library, we used  SEEED RGB LCD , Adafruit DHT11 , Adafruit RTC , Adafruit ADS1115 , MQ02 Gas Sensor, Dallas DS18B20 , Rotation from Gyro & Accelerometer, Time Alarm , and Time Lib . For internal library, we used Wire, pitches.h, CurieIMU and Software Serial. We used Mario Bros Tune developed by Dipto Pratyaksa to play sound at the beginning. IMU rotation angle we got from Erikyo. SFF Arduino sketch can be found at MANTIS GITHUB.Eagle LayoutWe build our own shield to make easier in pin connection. We used Eagle Software to build the schematic and board..Smart Floating Farm Custom Shield ', ""When we start submit our idea to Intel, we decide to use SIM900 GSM Module because we have some problem with ESP8266. As time goes by, we facing problem with Software Serial communication between SIM900 and Arduino101. SIM900 using 5 volt in communication and Arduino101 using 3.3 volt. We thought this difference in voltage maybe the main problem why Software Serial wasn't work. After that, we decide switch to ESP8266. We used Custom ESp8266 module from GeraiCerdas named MCCloud. ESP8266 using 3.3 volt as main voltage, same with Arduino101. But Unfortunately, we still facing the same problem. We tried to solve this problem by searching in the internet but no luck. Suddenly, we tried switch the keyword from Arduino101 to Arduino Due. Voila, we got the solution. We add pinMode (rx, INPUT) and pinMode (tx, OUTPUT) to ensure Software Serial works.We also encountered problem with relay. We used this relay. The problem is relay must powered by 5 volt so relay can switch from OFF to ON. we come with solution using pinMode (relay_pin, INPUT) and connect one relay pin to 5 volt and the other to Arduino101 Digital Pin. With pinMode we ensure that the voltage through relay will 5 volt.Sometimes, we connect sensor wrong so we must soldered again. We tried to write down in a paper the wire color and the pin, so we can remember and not wrong soldering the sensor.Arduino101 have problem when we upload the firmware. We often press MASTER_RESET button to upload the firmware. Arduino101 also must powered by adapter before connect it to computer. We experience our Arduino101 died and cannot recognized by computer. We dont know the fault because we never did something wrong to Arduino101. We think it is because the board. Board getting hot when we connect it to adapter. But, after we have another Arduino101, it is OK until right now.We encountered challenge to understand AT Command from ESP8266. Article from luciorocha, alselectro, fuho, Electrodragon, and ReiLabs very helpfull to make us understand how to use ESP8266. Before we connect ESP8266 with Arduino101, we tried AT Command using UART to TTL adapter.UART to TTLTrying GET and POST method was very challenging because we must communicate between Arduino division and IT division to decide the link for getting threshold and sending data.Arduino101 cannot use every external exist library in the internet. We came with problem when we use custom/indie library such as DS1307 library and I2C LCD 16x2.IMU Arduino101 must be updated all time. When we tried to make delay about five minutes, Arduino101 cant get the gyro real value. So we decide to read gyro value in the delay time to ensure we get the right gyro value.For dashboard challenge is make live chart using Highcharts. Because the technology is new for us, so we need to learn deeply to make it live. It can be see at SFF dashboard. "", 'We able to understand and using ESP AT Command using GET and POST method.We able to use Arduino101 Internal IMU.

"Fish-o-Tron","An end-to end solution for easily measuring &amp; tracking fish!","[3060, ""After reading the problem statement and chatting to Harry yesterday, who has worked in Fisheries for several years, we realised that there was a pressing need for a faster way to measure and record information about fish. The current procedure involves manually measuring several properties, recording the data offline, and then manually transcribing it into a spreadsheet for data analysis. We knew there had to be a better way.How it worksBy using state of the art computer vision technology, we are able to measure the length of a fish placed on our special board by using an overhead camera. Using this technique, and by averaging multiple readings and rejecting anomalies, we can obtain an average accuracy of +-5mm, which much better than the vast majority of manual readings, and significantly faster [approximately 1 second measurement time per fish]. We automatically upload this information to a public website which we have developed (visible here: http://fishotron.fyquah.me/ ) , where people can see information about the fish, as well as edit it. This enables simple, real-time auditing from interested organisations, as well as an easy way to increase engagement with the public, as they can discover just where their fish came from, using uploaded GPS data.Challenges and solutionsComputer vision is difficult! We initally tried to create tracking points (known as 'fiducial markers') by hand, and then identify them. However this was extremely challenging, and did not allow us to differentiate separate tracking points. By switching to using an external library, integrated into our code, we can very precisely track the location, rotation, ID and skew of multiple points in real time - allowing our software to work, even when the camera is not precisely positioned over the paper.Accomplishments that we are proud ofLearning to use OpenCV was great fun - it's a beautifully designed library, with a host of awesome features.

"LSDai","Earn Compound interest with your rDai collateral, while providing liquidity for hedges against variable Compound interest. Get high on interest! ","[6098, 'In a world of roller-coaster crypto volatility, we turned to Dai for stability. With the emergence of interest generating instruments born through layers of collateralization on crypto native synthetic assets, we are entering a phase of interest rate volatility. Introducing LSDai, for your escape to a peace of mind: earn Compound interest on your collateral with rDai, while providing liquidity for hedges against variable Compound interest.  Empirical studies from traditional finance have shown the adverse impact of variability in interest rates (the “price” of money) on the real economy. Accordingly, interest rate swap, used by non-financial firms in the management of the interest rate risk of their debt, is one of the most important fixed-income instrument in the trading and hedging of interest rate risk. An alternative to interest rate swap, Eurodollar futures, is the biggest and most liquid futures market traded in the US by volume. We have seen recent wild swings of Compound interest on Dai, going from 5% to peaking over 16% within a month. With the emergence of DeFi stack, more synthetic crypto assets composed of native assets are created and then rebundled on the Ethereum tech stack, enabling new possibilities while introducing complex interdependencies into the system. This is why we are creating LSDai.market, for hedgers and speculators to take leveraged long and short positions on Dai interest rates without borrowing by simply buying and selling LongDi and ShortDi tokens. ', 'LSDai creates a Euro-dollar like construct, that is a future on the Compound Dai lending rate over the duration of the contract. By leveraging Market Protocol which takes on the approach of constructing index futures via ""iron-cross options"" approach, LSDai de-couples the risk of the two sides via long and short position tokens.It enables three different types of users to gain the kind of exposure to the interest rate fluctuation that fits their profile, while aligns incentives.Hedgers: Hedgers are lending out their Dai on Compound and earn interest, but fear that the interest rate — thus, their passive revenue — will drop. LSDai’s Market Makers mint and sell them short Dai interest tokens for Dai, in the amount that will completely hedge their interest-earning position. This means they will experience no fluctuation: if the interest rate drops, the profit from the short will make them even, and if the rate goes up, the extra interest makes up for their loss. Hedgers can insure themselves against loss of income.Speculators: These players have no stake in the lending business, they just want to speculate on the changes in the interest rate. Bettors expect Dai’s lending interest rate on Compound to go up or down, and buy long or short Dai interest tokens from the LSDai Market Makers for Dai. They either gain or lose money, depending on where the interest rate goes… and how clear their mind was when they made their bet.Market makers: Market makers manage the minting and selling of the long or short Dai interest tokens ', 'We took a decentralized approach, adopting Market Protocol in decoupling the interest rate swap positions into margin-embedded Long and Short position tokens. We used Airswap to find the price of the Long ad Short position tokens. Given the importance of liquidity in the model, we programmed a bot to arbitrage away the spread across the Market Makers (Minters) of the token pairs and the Hedgers/Speculators.Lastly, in order to create virtuous loop to further incentivize the Market Makers, we implemented rDai as the collateral in Market Protocol in Minting of the position pair. Thus, Market Makers will be able to earn interest from the rDai collateral, in addition to earning the spread.For this hackathon, we are able to start from scratch and launch our LSDai on Ethereum Main Net. Since we are the first Market Maker in this product, we have decided to donate the interest accrued from rDai in the collateral to EthBerlin.  ', 'Figure out how to take a contract that is written to provide assets priced in dollars and invent a pricing structure for the interest rate swap, and how the pricing structure may fit into the existing Market Protocol smart contract that we have already deployed on Kovan.

"DeFake","Automatic DeepFake detection: protecting democracy from the next wave of misinformation. Uses machine learning to detect whether videos are authentic or deepfakes.","[5737, ""The upcoming election season is predicted to be drowned out by mass influx of fake news. Deepfakes are a new method to impersonate famous figures saying fictional things, and could be particularly influential in the outcome of this and future elections. With international misinformation becoming more common, we wanted to develop a level of protection and reality for users. Facebook's Deepfake Detection Challenge, which aims to crowdsource ideas, inspired us to approach this issue. "", 'Our Chrome extension processes the current video the user is watching. The video is first scanned using AWS to identify the politician/celebrity in subject. Knowing the public figure allows the app to choose the model trained by machine learning to identify Deepfakes targeting that specific celebrity. The result of the deep fake analysis are then shown to the user through the chrome extension, allowing the user to see in the moment whether a video might be authentic or forged.Our Web app offers the same service, and includes a prompt that describes this issue to users. Users are able to upload a link to any video they are concerned may be tampered with, and receive a result regarding the authenticity of the video. ', ""We used the PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to build the model by hand, and broke down the video into one second frames. Previous research has evaluated the mouths of the deepfake videos, and noticed that these are altered, as are the general facial movements of a person. For example, previous algorithms have looked at mannerisms of politicians and detected when these mannerisms differed in a deepfake video. However, this is computationally a very costly process, and current methods are only utilized in a research settings.Each frame is then analyzed with six different concavity values that train the model. Testing data is then used to try the model, which was trained in a Linear Kernel (Support Vector Machine). The Chrome extension is done in JS and HTML, and the other algorithms are in Python.The testing data set is comprised from the user's current browser video, and the training set is composed of Google Images of the celebrity.

', 'We are proud to have created our own model and make the ML algorithm work! It was very satisfying to see the PCA clusters, and graph the values into groups within the Support Vector Machine. Furthermore, getting each of the components ie, Flask and Chrome extension to work was gratifying, as we had little prior experience in regards to transferring data between applications. We are able to successfully determine if a video is a deep fake, and notify the person in real time if they may be viewing tampered content!

"", 'Train the model with more celebrities and get the chrome extension to output whether the videos in your feed are DeepFakes or not as you scroll. Specifically, this would be done by decreasing the run time of the machine learning algorithm in the background. Although the algorithm is not as computationally costly as conventional algorithms created by experts, the run time barrs exact real-time feedback within seconds. We would also like to use the Facebooks DeepFake datasets when they are released.Specifically, deepfakes are more likely to become a potent tool of cyber-stalking and bullying in the short term, says Henry Ajder, an analyst at Deeptrace.

I've always built webapps and I just finished an ML class so I wanted to try it out. Plus, now we can see if art can be scientifically generated? "", 'Sonata in Python reads in a series of MIDI files, mostly piano sonatas by Mozart or Beethoven. This acts as the training set for the neural network. The input nodes for the network take the duration and frequency of the preceding 5 notes as well as the current note, the preceding 3 chord progressions, and the corresponding note on the other clef. The output nodes produce the duration and frequency of the next note in the sequence, which is fed back as an input for the subsequent note. ', ""There is one neural network for the treble clef (right hand) and one for the bass clef (left hand). This is because the higher right hand notes often play a unique melody, while the lower left hand notes are often repeated, slower chords. I wanted to make sure these two very separate styles of music didn't confuse the neural network.  "", 'The biggest challenge is that feeding outputs back into the neural network will cause the network to converge. In the beginning, my compositions often converged to a single, repeating note. This produced extremely boring music. I fixed this by introducing mutations to the network. First I tried to sample a Gaussian distribution based on the mean and standard deviation of the error vectors. Then, I switched to a small percentage of changing the note by a perfect fifth or a perfect octave, both of which do not affect the flow of the music much. Furthermore, both the treble and bass clefs converged to the same note. I fixed this problem by splitting the the network in two, as mentioned earlier. Finally, neural networks do not give very exact predictions. Unfortunately, in music, even the slightest deviation will cause the music to sound out of tune. I often had quarter tones and random durations of notes. I fixed this by rounding the pitch and duration, which significantly increased the quality of the music. ', ""I'm proud of having done this project alone. I've been to a lot of hackathons in past years, but always under the tutelage of upperclassmen. Now that they've graduated, I'm sort of wondering on my own. I'm glad I was able to accomplish this project without others directing me. I'm also proud of how far I came with this project. I compared my first generated sonata to my most recent one and I was really impressed with how good the latter one sounded. Perhaps not yet at the level of Mozart, but it's certainly come a long way.  "", ""Music is hard! 36 hours is not enough to create an algorithm that can generate music that has been endeared for centuries.

Technically, I already knew this, but to be able to produce this quality of a music generating, machine learning algorithm in under 250 lines is incredible. Yes, I only wrote 250 [very well thought out and tested via trial and error!] lines. Python is life.I was also introduced to pybrain and music21, Python libraries used for neural networks and analyzing music, respectively. Both of these are very well made and I hope I have an opportunity to explore more of their features in future projects.Also, I had to learn a lot of stat. It was pretty uncomfortable, and I'm not a fan... "", ""Obviously, more fine tuning of parameters in order to produce even more beautiful music. While I did consider chords in the neural network, harmony is probably the most important missing feature. Harmony analysis is a 36 hour project on its own, and would greatly improve the project. In addition, I'm hoping to expand to concertos and contemporary music. Sonatas are fairly easier because they are generally piano only, with only a left and right hand. Opening to more types of music would be very fun.PS. Unfortunately, I have no pictures! There's not much to show about a neural network...

From his own experience, and from countless interviews with highly successful people, Nick understood the many benefits of keeping a personal record of one\'s daily life and experiences.  Unfortunately, after testing every well-known journaling product available, Nick struggled to find a platform that fit his needs.  Specifically, he wanted a solution that was:   Portable (available for both Web and mobile)   Easy to use   Easy to manage   Flexible (supporting multiple platforms, email integrations, etc.)   Designed to handle both public and private journal types   Built with features to simplify collaboration and sharing of public entries   Capable of exporting content or publishing to a hardbound bookWhat is JRNL?At JRNL, we believe that Life is Worth Recording, and that by keeping and reflecting upon past experiences, we can better address future challenges.

To date, it has registered just over 65,000 users who, in turn, have created over one million unique posts.  It\'s important to note that the product is ""in the wild"" and we are iterating and making improvements based upon user feedback.The platform is supported by an experienced team of developers and operators, with multiple successful ventures, numerous industry awards (over 40 combined), and well over $4 Billion in value created.Key members include:Nick Jones - Founder, Lead Visionary   16+ Years Management, Marketing & Operations Experience    Brand Consultant to Wrangler, Special Olympics & Mandalay ResortsSteve Reed - Co-Founder, Lead Designer   13+ Years Branding and Graphic / Web Design Experience   Past work recognized by Wired and MSNBCJay Goodwin - Chief Architect   16+ Years Senior Software Development Experience    Previous teams have won dozens of industry awardsGlenn Argenbright - Advisor & Board Member   19+ Years Executive Experience   Six High Value Exits as Founder or CEO – 3 IPOs / 3 AcquisitionsHow it was builtOur product team consists of seven designers and developers working out of two distinct locations, separated by a two hour time differential.  Fortunately, the team was broken into two groups, each with a unique set of skills and responsibilities.  One team focused on backend processes and all Web application development, while the other team focused on Mobile development and front-end UI design.  This allowed us to minimize the impact of working with two remote development teams. The remote nature of the team also impacted certain design decisions.  Realizing that we wanted multi-platform compatibility and a consistent user experience, we decided to go with a microservices based architecture.  The Web platform was originally built as a single page application, using the React Javascript Framework.  The app communicates with the Web Server via http and https calls, to a Django based backend.  For mobile, we originally used Xamarin Forms, communicating via http and https to the same backend as our Web application.  We will likely move away from Xamarin in the future.For data storage, we use a mix of three technologies.  Specifically, MariaDB, Elasticsearch, and Redis.  We opted to use a cloud based hosting provider, so that we could rapidly scale resources as needed, and to reduce ongoing operational overhead.Challenges We EncounteredTeam:  Operating remote teams presents numerous challenges.  We’ve had to work hard to avoid or minimize communication breakdowns, scheduling misunderstandings (due to time zones), unclear design requirements, poor prioritization, faulty expectations, focus drift, feature creep, and overall clarity of the product vision.  Additionally, team members varied significantly in terms of both overall experience and technical knowledge, which was only amplified by the remote nature of our work environments.  This necessitated additional time for training and education, as well as a more structured communication methodology.Tech:  On the Web app side, the choice of React was a risk due to its relative lack of maturity as a platform, combined with our own learning curve and an associated lack of available documentation, best practices, and other materials relating to the platform.  As an example, we initially chose to use the React Flux framework provided by Facebook, combined with datastore and API abstraction libraries with which we were already familiar.  This proved challenging, because the tools lacked maturity, and because we were attempting to use old methodologies (depending on old libraries), rather than leveraging the various benefits inherent in React.  After a few false starts, we settled on Redux as a full replacement for all existing datastores, which proved prescient given that the React community has now, for the most part, settled on Redux as a best practices approach.Product:  Initially, we designed the product as a single-user private journaling tool but, as the product progressed, we recognized a real need for private, semi-public and public journals, offering the ability to share content and collaborate with others, in order to create a more complete record.  However, through this process, we soon learned that sharing and collaboration, at least in terms of journaling, is not nearly as simple and obvious as initially thought.  One obvious challenge revolves around content ownership.  In a private journal, it is quite obvious who owns the content, but that understanding breaks down as soon as you share the content with others and allow them to contribute to the journal.  As an example, if I invite Sally to collaborate on a specific event or entry, who then owns the content - both of us, neither, me, or Sally?  Taking this even further, if I invite her to collaborate on my journal, can she then invite others to collaborate as well?  When we first started talking about sharing, we found that each person looked at it differently, depending on their experience.  Some focused on social sharing (Facebook and other social networks), some focused on permission-based sharing (Dropbox), and still others focused on email or other legacy-based sharing options (forums, listservs, etc.).  In fact, it’s become clear to us that journaling presents its own challenges with respect to both sharing and collaboration, and we had to create rules and functionality to account for each of the three paradigms mentioned above, while at the same time making sure that our users understand the implications of such actions with regards to their content.Accomplishments We\'re Proud OfThere are many things that we’re proud of as a team.  For the most part, such items can be broken out into two categories - inward facing, “operational” issues, and outward facing, “product” issues.Operational items include:   The successful management of remote development teams   The ability to attract “top tier” talent on a limited budget   The ability to address and account for complex sharing issues far beyond other offerings   That we’ve remained true to our core principals.  We always respect user privacy, even when looking at concepts such as sharing and collaboration.  This is very different from Facebook and other well-known social platformsProduct items include:   The knowledge that we’ve helped many families capture their history and produce books creating a generational link for the future   The creation of unique habit building tools, and their impact on journaling (as evidenced by the total volume of posts created)   The many ways we’ve simplified and made journaling more accessibleWhat We LearnedMost of what we’ve learned thus far is the direct result of user feedback.  Through research, surveys, and unsolicited user comments, we know there is a great demand for reminders, prompts and other tools to maximize the journaling experience.  In fact, habit creation tools and other prompts to battle writer’s block, and to encourage daily activity, are among the most often requested items from our users. We’ve also learned that this is a complex problem.  This explains why existing solutions continue to struggle when it comes to addressing key areas of concern.  This fact is further complicated by the reality that any associated product must be easy to use - otherwise, users won’t journal on a regular basis.  However, as one might expect, building simple solutions for complex problems is no small task.  We believe that current rates of user adoption (65k+ beta users) and high levels of daily engagement (1M+ posts), show that we’re on the right path.What\'s Next For JRNL?As noted above, we are currently expanding our sharing and collaboration toolsets.  In addition, we plan to greatly expand our current “habit building tools,” offering specialized categories and subcategories so that users can customize the prompts they are likely to see.  This work will also tie in to customized journaling types and templates (camping, cooking, travel, fitness, diet, etc.).  We are also looking at ways that people might contribute to journals through voice / text transcription through the mobile app (or via a microphone).  We also plan to add various legacy components in 2016, allowing users to send individual messages (or complete journals) to friends and family members at some predetermined date in the future (or upon the completion of certain triggering events).Built Withdjangoelasticsearchmariadbnode.jsreactredisreduxxamarinTry it outwww.jrnl.com      Submitted to    RootsTech Innovator Showdown    Created by  Brand, project creation, fund raising, team building, management, and every other hat that goes with a startup.Nick JonesBranding, web design, UX/UI, front-end development, and marketing materials for JRNL.Steve ReedJay GoodwinAmy VelozJay Goodwin ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['react', 'django', 'node.js', 'mariadb', 'elasticsearch', 'redis', 'xamarin', 'redux']","False","10","['jrnl', 'nickjones', 'notjay', 'amyveloz', 'stev3reed']","https://firefly-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/usercontent/fill/242/161/cGhvdG9zL3Byb2R1Y3Rpb24vc29mdHdhcmVfdGh1bWJuYWlsX3Bob3Rvcy8wMDAvMzI4Lzc5MC9kYXRhcy9vcmlnaW5hbC5qcGc=/devpost-thumb.jpg?signature=7aca8e550bf590288db032e58e7858d8c89c2fff","True","2"
"Pigeon Point","Summarizes flooded and nasty group chats into topics with clean bullet points of key events.","[4030, ""Everyone has those friends who just add you to their group chats, and then you get incessantly flooded with notifications. After muting conversations, you'll miss invitations and key messages, mainly because you didn't see them. Now there's a way to manage your notifications and be sure that you miss out.It was especially helpful for the TreeHacks Slack group. Especially since we're hacking, we preferred not to be notified much, or spend time just to see where lunch is. It also helped us find out that a guy just dropped off an Echo in the hardware booth, and we promptly intercepted it from another team. :DWe also built this for accessibility. Most people with vision disorders or physical disabilities have a hard time talking to their friends (since most of us use instant messaging, not calls). Our project would allow these people to have the Echo talk to them and basically act as their social assistant. "", ""To summarize group messages from GroupMe, you could tell Alexa to summarize whichever group you want. She'll then tell you what topics were discussed, and the main points said in each topic. She'll even tell you about what certain people were feeling. If you don't fully understand the messages, you could ask her for the context, and she'll tell you what was said before and after. The same functions work if you want your Slack messages summarized.For Slack specifically, we built a Slackbot, which you could enter your commands to select which group to summarize. All the other functions above apply here too!  "", ""For the summarization itself, we implemented Jolo Balbin's thesis on summarizing a single topic text block. It involved finding the most common ideas, and ranking the sentences based on how similar they were to other sentences. This was coded in Python, and lives inside an AWS Lambda function. Most group chats have many conversations going on though, so we also built a classifier function using IBM Alchemy's concept extractor and clustered similar words together using NLTK. We then ran the summarization script on each of the specific conversation topics and got out key points.The Slack Bot was hosted using a Python flask image running on Microsoft Azure, that's where all the API calls and data lived. This was called on by the Lambda function on AWS. We then used our Lambda function and Azure backend to link functionality to the Echo. "", ""We had a hard time when we first ran our summarizer on the Slack conversations, because it wasn't optimized for multiple topics. We fixed this by splitting the conversation.It was hard to get our hands on an Echo, so we developed most of it without being able to see results on the go. Our Slack summarization backend saved us though. Also, we had a hard time deploying packages on AWS because it needed us to make special versions of NLTK and other packages to run. "", ""We're particularly proud about implementing one of NLP's hardest problems, and how we worked around the limitations of the thesis by classifying messages.Also, we're proud of building something that would help us and almost everyone, and how it helps a certain segment greatly. "", 'All of us were well versed in Python and backend, but not so much on web development. We had a fun time learning about deployment and learning about how servers communicate with each other. ', ""Link our backend to Facebook Messenger, text messages, and even news sites. Then we can get acquired by Microsoft's GroupMe or Facebook.

"Neighborhood Airport Noise Monitor","Continuously monitor and complain to Metro Airports Commission about elevated aircraft noise in your neighborhood.","[2622, 'This year (2015) people living in South Minneapolis have filed a record-amount of complaints of aircraft noise. Each complaint requires a phone call. As an engineer working in the IoT industry, I believe the residents of any neighborhood near an Airport could benefit from a small, cheap solution that can identify when an aircraft flies over their house and files a complaint for them.  ', ""Powered by a microprocessor with a Python interpreter, an audio input and an internet connection, the device will continuously sample the Sound Pressure Level (SPL) in decibels as well as analyze the timbre of the sampled audio to determine if the sound heard was a commercial aircraft. The device will continuously report the SPL to Exosite, but will make its best effort to report an aircraft event when its native algorithm makes an appropriate determination. The reason for the analysis of the audio timbre processing on the device is to keep a large portion of the signal processing performed on the gear the user/community has already paid for. It makes no sense to do processing in the cloud when a cheap device is capable of it as well. This will keep the cost of the IoT solution down.MAC currently has 39 listening towers. From this picture one can easily see there are underserved neighborhoods. The aim of this project is to crowd-source the datacollection and provide another means of accountability for airport noise. In engineering, it is good practice to have someone besides the developer test the code / hardware. It's a system of checks and balances just like the American system of government. Currently, MAC seems to monitor, police and regulate itself. With a democratic monitoring system, we might find that some neighborhoods' complaints will now be backed by evidence.Other useful linksWikipedia on how noise affects stressNeat article on SPL and healthStar Tribune article on S.
