As your cryptographic power increases during the game, you would be able to decrypt more and more of your opponent's parts of the file, to eventually locate them and destroy them.  This game would use a save file to store the game state at varying levels of encryption.  Anyone who runs the game with that file would be able to join into that round of the game, as long as they can send the file back to the other participants (with their moves added to the mix).  I actually see this file sharing mechanism as a big strength for flexibility and interesting concepts in the game (security risks aside lol).  It also allows people without a strong or stable internet connection to participate.  You just need to be able to send a single file (and it doesn't have to be transmitted fast either, as long as it arrives in one piece).  The branching file mechanism, whereby anyone who has a file can play in that world, but the people who originally were playing there may just be participating on a different branch, or instance, of the same file, is very interesting to me.

This is helpful before a natural disaster -- if a house is flooded, for example, there will be no record of what the user owned, how much it was worth, et cetera.

However it is not that convenient to log in every time to check, for example, todo list for today. It would be nice to have a Slack bot that can push notifications and provide some manual query functions that can integrate Canvas into Slack. ', 'So far, it is simply a demo. The user can add the app into their Slack workspace, then follow the setup process to connect with their own Canvas account, then they would be able to fetch the current course list from Canvas. ', 'We used the transposit for transferring data from Canvas to Slack. By default, transposit has native support for Slack, so that can be used. However, it does not have support for Canvas. So we used SwaggerHub to create an (incomplete) OpenAPI 3.0 compatible definition of the Canvas LMS REST API. With API definition we created a Canvas Connector on transposit. Then it is possible to use SQL to query items from Canvas. ', 'In the Canvas API, the way they implement the parameter serialization is weird. Instead of the normal way of doing like ""list=item0&list=item1"", ""list=item0,item1""or ""list[0]=item0&list[1]=item1"", they decided to implement it as ""list[]=item0&list[]=item1"". This way of doing serialization is not supported in OpenAPI. This is fine, it can still be described with OpenAPI. Just rename the parameter from list to list[], then use the normal explode serialization. However this is acceptable when calling in the SQL, or probably from many other languages, as item[] is not a legal parameter name. So far we had to leave it out for now.Another challenge is the key expiration. Token from Canvas can have a expiration duration. Manually generated token never expires, so that\'s fine. However, token requested by third-party applications such as this bot via OAuth 2.0 would expire in 1 hour. The application need to refresh the token at least every hour. Transposit uses a ""managed authentication"" flow, where the token is managed by the transposit. Luckily it provided a ""runtime"" authentication method, allowing the application script to fetch the token. Though the application is unable to store the new refreshed token back, it may just use the token for the first time, then store all new tokens to user settings as a setting. However this is not perfect, runtime authentication cannot be used in conjunction with OAuth 2 managed authentication, making it rather hard for user to setup their account for the first time. ', ""It actually works, though Canvas and Transposit doesn't really fit together (as we found out later) "", 'Do thorough investigation before choosing the platform or framework.

Like sync all announcements from Canvas to Slack, or being able to watch activities within a Course, subscribe changes for a single file (some professors like to put a 'news.pdf' and update that file for communication), etc.The idea of transposit is great. But their are certain quirks in Canvas that doesn't well translate to transposit's expected interface. Unless Transposit has workarounds for these quirks, we might actually need to move out from Transposit, and implement the bot purely in JavaScript or Python, so all the proposed functions can be implemented.

A water bottle that does it for you. "", 'The SmartBottle tracks how much water you are drinking from the bottle by sensing how much you tilt the bottle. The amount of water recorded is based on your own drinking speed. When you first get the bottle, you can train a machine learning model simply by drinking water while pressing down the recording button and inputting how much you drank in each swig into an app. This way, the model is completely personalized and can accurately estimate how much you are drinking. The app also lets you input your weight and tells you how much water you should drink a day based on that. There is a progress bar on the home screen to visualize just how far you are getting each day with your water intake. There is also a feature in the app that allows you to input the foods you eat and adds the water from those foods into your daily hydration, since much of the water we get each day is from foods. ', 'We used an Adafruit 9-DOF gyro and accelerometer to read in the tilt of the bottle using the magnetic field of the Earth.

Because we still wanted to be able to access wifi or bluetooth in order to connect the bottle to an app, we had to continue using the Raspberry Pi, so we found a way to transfer data from the Arduino to the Pi. Another challenge we ran into was getting the data from a python script on the Pi onto the app. The gyro data had to be read in through Python, and the machine learning script was also in Python, but we were unable to find a way to transfer the data through bluetooth unless it was in javascript on the Pi which it was not.

"Project Grizzly ","Project Grizzly is a forest fire prediction and locating network utilizing smart devices. We gather data along with wildlife travel patterns to better predict and locate possible forest fires.","[5039, ""We were inspired and motivated by the countless forest fires in California. The number of forest fires has been increasing consistently every year in California. Most solutions so far are off ground solutions. These projects don't gather data from the ground where fires actually take place. Our goal is to use environmental data and animal behavior to predict and locate potential areas where forest fires can start. The name Project Grizzly comes from California's state animal, which is a grizzly bear. California is an example location of where our network could work.  "", 'Project Grizzly is not a single IoT device, it is a network of data gathered by smart devices and then processed by machine learning algorithms. Here is how everything is connected: Project Grizzley uses wildlife behavior to track patterns in movement to locate potential fires starting. Large mammals such as elk, deer, and grizzly bears are known to not only act quickly but also act before fires become largely detectable. Inserting GPS tracking systems into animals allows us to view when a change in their behavior occurs. For example, elk and deer run towards bodies of water when fires break out. If Project Grizzley’s algorithm sees a large population of deer and elk moving towards bodies of water, then there is a strong change a certain portion of the forest is engulfed in fire.  Project Grizzly uses five foot tall rod to detect biomass density and environmental changes to assess potential outbreaks of fire. Forest fires feed off of dense leaf and plantae coverage. Knowing which portions of the forest have a growing collection of dead leaves and thick moss allows us to know where to be wary of forest fires. The ROD gathers this data using… It then sends this data via satellite using satellite networking solutions such as Abela by Inmarsat. This data gets processed by Project Grizzly and then is determined to be potentially dangerous or not. Data acquisition and analysis is what makes Project Grizzley so powerful. The use of various data sets along with machine learning algorithms, allows Project Grizzley to predict and locate potential forest fires in continuously changing ecosystem. Project Grizzley uses MongoDB to store data from the ROD and GPS tracking systems. This data is then processed through IBM Watson to get probability values of forest fires occurring in specific locations. Project Grizzly adjusts and gathers data for unique environments. Every ROD and tracking group gathers data for a specific location, which allows us to monitor precise areas.   ', 'Essentially our data from our GPS tracking system and ROD device is sent to our MongoDB server using the satellite technology, Abela by Inmersat. This data is then processed by our model in IBM - Watson.

We spent a lot of time trying to figure out was Project Grizzly is and what exactly it does.  ', 'Going off of the challenges we faced, we are very proud of the vision of Project Grizzly and what it is designed to do. We think our network design is unique and well thought out. Our intended network is complex but solves its intended problem with sensible solutions. Tracking animals and having a biomass and local environment sensor makes a lot of sense.  ', 'We learned a decent amount of MongoDB and IBM Watson technology. We realized a new, at least for us, usage for both of these technologies. It was also the first time a couple of us tied together data acquisition with machine learning.  ', 'The next step immediate step for Project Grizzly would be to use a prototype ROD to gather biomass and weather data from a local environment. We want to then process this data and see what we can model from data processing. We would also like to gather GPS data for animal patterns and run it into machine learning algorithms like IBM Watson. Though, this animal tracking step is a little more resource heavy than a prototype ROD. If we were to carry out this project down the road, we believe that a sufficient prototype network consists of tracking systems in a small population of grizzly bears, elk, and deer along with dozens of ROD devices placed in different parts of forests.

At the opening ceremony, we were all a bit shocked after the video about IBM\'s top hackathon winner, project OWL. Our idea, to a tee. Back to the drawing board. First, we looked a little deeper into what project OWL does exactly. We learned that each of their networks are client-server models, with ""PapaDucks"" acting as servers, and individual ducks as clients. Additionally, we realized that their product is mainly the physical network, not software on that network for disaster survivors.We decided that our goal was to help survivors in the event of internet and cellular service loss maintain their ability to stay informed and communicate with the people around them with already-existing technology in their pockets. ', 'SafetyNET is a communications service run over a custom-built decentralized peer-to-peer network. Main functionality so far includes: network-wide chat and disaster relief information spreading.Our chatroom is quite simple. Since every node in the network can connect directly to every other node, whenever the user enters a chat message, every other user receives it. This allows quick, scalable chatting. Through an IBM cloud object storage resource, we set up a ""bucket"" in which we, or in the future first responders, news outlets, and disaster alert services, can store the most relevant data to disaster survivors. Then, when a machine running our p2p network detects that it can connect to the internet, it downloads this data, reconnects to the network, and sends it to all the other machines on the network. This way, even just one person getting access to the internet allows many people to receive potentially life-saving information. ', ""We wrote everything in python. The P2P network files run a built-in module 'socket', which acts as a door to send and receive data packets between computers.The communication between the IBM Cloud and our network goes through a module 'ibm_boto3' which allows python to extract data from the Cloud and return a string with the contents of the chosen file in the bucket. "", 'Multiprocessing: A large goal of our project was allowing the P2P network to multiprocess, i.e. giving each node in the network the ability to send and receive packets simultaneously. This concept is the epitome of peer-to-peer networking, making it the largest difference from a client-server network. ', ""Our peer to peer network had to be custom-built due to some of the requirements we had for it and the lack of high-quality modules available on python for peer to peer networking. This was quite a challenge, very enjoyable, and something we are very proud of being successful with.Using the ibm_boto3 python module, we built a program to connect to our IBM Cloud Object Storage Resource, read off the list of buckets, go into a bucket and extract the file(s), and parse the body of the files into a string.

', ""Waterspout uses a 1-meter resolution digital elevation model (DEM) from the New York state GIS Clearinghouse centered on Troy, NY. A mosaic of several DEMs was stitched together and preprocessed with the sink-filling algorithm of Wang and Liu.

People are condemned and burdened by the work, and feel that they are not getting a fair say in their company decisions, and are not being recognized for their work. To increase employee engagement and satisfaction, we felt that an app that allows executives to interact with the views of their employees would be a great solution. Thus, we created ManagE. It is envisioned to be a platform which considers employees and executives as equals, and fabricates an open environment for all employees to discuss their issues on recent company decisions, current events, and issues. ', 'Our web app is a platform where employees and employers can communicate regarding specific company decisions. While promoting discussion, the app also keeps the anonymity of those who are conveying their opinions. In many companies, discussions sometimes turn into debates and criticisms. In fact, some employees are fired just because they voice their opinion. This situation can be observed in the newest of startups, to successfully established businesses such as Google. Similar to how votes are measured without collecting the name of a voter, our app displays the opinions of employees within a company while keeping the anonymity and privacy of those employees. Each employee has a username and password that they register for authentication purposes. The username is kept private to that employee himself/herself and the employer does not know whether that employee is registered or not. The purpose and main functionality of this app is to promote honest discussions and, at the same time, prevent conflict, criticism, or other unfavorable consequences for those voicing their opinions. Though free speech is a basic natural right provided to us by the U.S. Constitution, our app is one of several developments that assist in protecting that free speech. ', ""ManagE used a variety of aspects, including a dynamic back-end and a multitude of static pages. For the back-end, we used Django, due to our expertise in Python. The front-end was mainly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however, to create the different features of our website, we required more than the simple JavaScript. We needed a place to store every employee's messages. This is why we used ScaleDrone, a javascript API for messaging. It has a built-in database, and dynamic storage. "", 'The two main aspects of programming this app were programming the front-end and the back-end of our website. Some technical difficulties we faced while programming this web app were issues with javascript and jQuery, along with accessing our ScaleDrone messages database. As these were new programs and tools for us, we struggled to smoothly implement them into our web app. Being able to minimize the amount of files and increasing efficiency with these tools was also quite a struggle, due to their differing characteristics. We also faced technical difficulties programming the back-end. Link routing and database implementation were some of the issues. However, the greatest issue was understanding the framework we implemented for back-end and configuring the back-end to suit our purposes. We tackled these difficulties by surfing online resources along with implementing our own troubleshooting skills.

For example, a feature that counts the amount of pro/con keywords in the employees’ discussions, and formulates a bar graph based on the occurrences of the keywords, proving whether or not the common consensus of a decision is positive or negative.

"QuickCards","Learn quick with QuickCards, we provide a new and more efficient way to study for tests by self generating QuickCards from your own personal notes to a traditional flash card. ","[4226, ""Being passionate about academics, it frustrated us to see many students struggle academically due to inefficient study techniques. We observed many of our peers spend their limited study time before their exams, on tasks such as flashcard creation. Flashcards have proven to be one of the most effective ways to study, utilizing many metacognitive faculties and engaging active recall, which is crucial for memorization and studying. However, because of the laborious nature of re-writing one's entire course material on flashcards just to be able to review from them, many find it not worthwhile to spend time creating them. We came to UB Hacking to solve this issue for students by utilizing computer vision on students' notes to automate the process of flashcard creation. "", ""Quick Cards allows a student to scan their notes, and uses Google's Cloud Vision API for handwriting detection and OCR to process their notes, and generate flashcards based on them. It currently features a web-based interface which allows its users to upload a picture of their notes, typically taken by their phone. It then makes an API call to Google Cloud Vision service, which captures the location of the elements on the notes and parses the handwriting into text. "", ' ', 'One of the challenges we ran into was first with the detection of the boxes of text. The boxes formed around areas of words with high word density were overlapping with other paragraphs which made it hard to distinguish between the block and this caused the algorithm to ineffectively distinguish between the key (i.e the title) and value (i.e the explantation). Due to this, it would be hard to insert the word/question on one side of the flashcard and the answer/definition on the other side.  ', 'We managed to detect text from images and converted that into flashcards. We managed to stay awake for the whole night and worked on our project. On a serious note, we managed to understand the Google Cloud vision API, implement our own techniques to optimize the detection.

"ecoShopper","Shop the green way","[4871, ""What inspired us to create this product? Apathy is the word!Data from Climate Change in the American Mind surveys show that around 73% of Americans think global warming is happening and almost 69% say that they are worried about climate change. Seems like a promising number right? But, according to Nielsen, in the U.S. sales of products with sustainable attributes make up to only 22% of the total store, with organic, sustainable and clean attributes driving the majority of the sustainable category’s growth.Thus we can observe, there is a vast gap between awareness and the percentage of people who are actually taking the extra steps to act on it. However, all’s not lost; here’s the silver lining. Nielsen also points out that around 75% of millennials are willing to change their purchase/consumption habits in order to reduce the impact of the environment. This is where ecoShopper comes in. We make use of the positive willingness of the millennials and the consumers in them and try to influence them, by giving the right impetus, towards greener steps. Our chrome extension and web application aims to play on the users' tendencies and make it more convenient for them to notice and buy Eco-friendly products.Action: What ecoShopper does?ecoShopper is a Chrome Extension that offers alternative Eco-friendly products as suggested products when a customer adds any product to his/her shopping cart. It includes a web dashboard, which keeps track of user data and presents various metrics of how their shopping activity affects the environment. Thus making the user aware of his/her contributions and keeping him/her motivated about helping the environment.Creation:The initial phase of the project involved the creation of a Chrome extension. For the chrome extension, we had to use javascript primarily for all the functionalities and JSON for the manifest. The main focus of the extension was to search for similar eco-friendly products as to ones enlisted in the cart of an eCommerce site. We achieve that by using an API along with our NLP - RAKE model which extracts keywords from the cart's products and feeds it to the API to get similar eco-friendly products. Beyond this, we have also created a web dashboard that would help the user keep track of his changes. In that, we measure various metrics like savings in terms of emission, materials ( plastic, etc. ) and also showcasing overall contribution of all users to motivate each user to do better. Challenges:There were various challenges we encountered, few of which were related to the extension development which none of us had done before. Few were related to the google cloud app engine since it is meant for a proper Production environment. Hence, we had to apply appropriate techniques to get it set for our application. It consumed a lot of time, but was worth developing since dealing with issues was easier once it was set up since it was a prod environment and debugging was cleaner. Accomplishments:Created a chrome extension from scratch with minimal external assistanceBypassed various hurdles in terms of unavailability of Amazon API( only available for associates ) which was our basic framework when we were planning it. Developed a flask web app in a Prod environment to be pushed into the Google Cloud App EngineTakeaways: What we learnedLearnt how to build an extensionLearnt how to build web applications in a Production environment In the process of learning about our target audience, we realized how many people actually want to make changes for the environment, but don't have enough information to act on it in their busy livesUsed NLP-RAKE model and analysis of various other models for short sized keyword extractionScope:  What's next for ecoShopperEcoShopper can have varied applications in the real-world.

"Autism Speaks","""if you've met an individual with autism ,you've met one individual with autism "". Approximately 1% (7.5 billion) of the global population is affected by autism and we are here to help them .  ","[5894, 'Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment condition associated with significant healthcare costs, and early diagnosis can significantly reduce these. The economic impact of autism and the increase in the number of ASD cases across the world reveals an urgent need for the development of easily implemented and effective screening methods. Therefore, a time-efficient and accessible ASD screening is imminent to help health professionals and inform individuals whether they should pursue formal clinical diagnosis. The rapid growth in the number of ASD cases worldwide necessitates datasets related to behaviour traits. However, such datasets are rare making it difficult to perform thorough analyses to improve the efficiency, sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of the ASD screening process. Presently, very limited autism datasets associated with clinical or screening are available and most of them are genetic in nature.  ', 'Hence, we propose a new dataset related to autism screening of adults that contained 20 features to be utilised for further analysis especially in determining influential autistic traits and improving the classification of ASD cases.With just the help of these features - including sample questionnaires and some birth facts, we have provided a Machine Learning model that can evaluate the chances of a person being diagnosed with autism with an accuracy of around 80%.  ', 'We took Autism Screening Questionnaires and developed a set of features with the output being in a binary format of 0 or 1 evaluating or NO or a YES.Some of these Questions were as follows:. has a deviant style of communication with a formal, fussy, old-fashioned or “robotlike” language          invents idiosyncratic words and expressionshas a different voice or speechexpresses sounds involuntarily; clears throat, grunts, smacks, cries or screamsis surprisingly good at some things and surprisingly poor at othersuses language freely but fails to make adjustment to fit social contexts or the needs of different listenerslacks empathymakes naïve and embarrassing remarkshas a deviant style of gazewishes to be sociable but fails to make relationships with peerscan be with other children but only on his/her termslacks best friendlacks common senseis poor at games: no idea of cooperating in a team, scores “own goals”.We also had other features such as ethnicity, gender etc.The dataset was then refined in order to reduce the features by cutting down the ones that weighted a lot less by having very little significance on the output classification.We deployed the model in 2 phases: Used several distinct classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest and an Ensemble Classifier to get the best possible trained model and evaluate it based on past models used. Ran the model on Google Colab.Used IBM Watson to generate a model for the refined data we had. It made it easier since it showed 4 pipelines with different hyper-parameters tuning. We created a model and deployed the same to be used on our mobile devices as a service. ', 'Overfitting was the most serious problem we had. Finding the correct ratio of bias vs variance was really difficult to find as some features were being overweighed by our models thereby making the other features redundant.This was more prominently happening on IBM Watson as it tries to derive the best possible model by running huge number of epochs and iterations over the model thereby overfitting it.As far as manual running was concerned, we reduced overfitting by tuning the hyper-parameters such as reducing the number of epochs, using different models to come up with a better fit for unseen inputs, etc.For IBM Watson, we observed that the testing data was very less as it automatically uses only 5% of the data for testing and 95% for training. So the model is overtrained on a number of examples it observes. We increased the amount of testing data to 30%.After that, we had to make altercations with the data, as it was not consistent with data types, thereby causing problems in giving a better result.So we made the data consistent with data types and the model started giving way better results.We saved this model and deployed it for using it as a service. ', 'Waiting times for an ASD diagnosis are lengthy and procedures are not cost effective. By using our methodology of incorporating Machine Learning with probable screening questionnaires, we will be able to cull out these problems and it will be viable for everyone to use. This is a model created with keeping people in mind. We want to make sure that everyone is given an equal and proper chance to diagnose their child with autism. ', 'We were able to learn the AutoAI feature of IBM Cloud and how using it can save considerable time and space. Apart from that, we were able to effectively run and train the model on Google Colab which was furthermore a big advantage for us. ', 'We want to improve the accuracy of our model and improve the dataset further. There is a lot of variance in screening questions from place to place and we want to try incorporating all those with dependencies on the place the person being diagnosed is from.

"SafeZone","Save lives with the touch of a button","[5289, 'The City of Ottawa is currently upgrading their hospitals to a new electronic health record system, and rather than speeding up the process, the slow learning curve for the system has drastically increased wait times for emergency response teams. One of our team-mates hosted a tournament where a player tore their achilles, when 911 was called it was estimated that the ambulance would come in 1 hour. When a victim is in an emergency situation, receiving immediate first aid could save their life. For example, a non-breathing victim who receives CPR immediately has a much higher chance of survival than someone who waited for an ambulance to arrive. Our team member Hari, who is certified in First Aid and CPR, realized that there are many people who are certified to be able to provide basic First Aid and perhaps minor treatment for a person in need. So he came up with the idea of an app that can instantly connect a person in need to nearby First Responders.  ', 'Using SafeZone, a user can call for help after which they will immediately connected to a nearby First Responder. Depending on the severity of the situation, the user will be advised to still call 911. Once the Responder is on the way, he/she will be able to contact the user who requested help to provide helpful instructions or get to know the situation before arriving. In an ideal scenario, the Responder reaches the user and provides First Aid until EMS arrives. In order for a user to be recognized as a First Responder on SafeZone, they must upload certification and wait for approval.  ', ""SafeZone was built as an Android application using Kotlin and Android Studio. We wanted the app to be clean in terms of design and for the user experience to be easy. So we made a very detailed design on Figma with all the views and app-flows before starting the development of the app. Google Firebase is powering our authentication, database, storage, and backend functions. We're using Google Cloud Platform/Google Maps API to get user location, calculating routes and distances. "", 'During the course of the hackathon we ran into a few challenges. The most prominent ones included some aspect of troubleshooting the google maps API. It was challenging to retrieve the location of the user, along with calculating the location of the closest first responder. In order for the google maps API to function properly, the user must provide some permissions that enable services. Setting these permission also brought up some challenges such as what happens if a user rejects the permission request.  ', 'We were able to produce a full minimum viable product over this 37 hour hackathon, from building a thorough design flow to implementing the basic functions of SafeZone. Though we ran into many technical road blocks along the way, we were able to overcome them all by making use of the expertise of each of our team members and staying organized throughout our design and build process. We established a clear work flow which focused the direction of our project and created a clean foundation for SafeZone.  ', ""Each member of our team has a different strength which was super cool because we were all able to learn so much from each other. For example, we all learned a lot about good design principles from Aarthi who is an amazing designer. With regards to the app itself, we chose to code in Kotlin which we knew almost nothing about. We literally learned a completely new language and built a working application with it which is awesome. Towards the half-way point, we decided that at a hackathon it's not worth it to nit-pick on minor details/issues, we could have saved a lot of time if we kept pushing forward to work on the main features - definitely something we learned for next time. "", ""Our team is really passionate about the idea which sparked SafeZone. We will finish the app, clean it up, add all the basic features it needs, and try to launch it in a city (probably Ottawa our hometown).

"PharmaFly","Get your prescriptions delivered by drone.","[4762, ' ', 'After registering, we automatically connect you to our service using NCRs payment API. When you get a prescription medication from your doctor we will automatically add it to our list!Our application color codes your prescription items so its easy to find information when you need it. When you need to pick up a new prescription, or are running low on your current order, we deliver! Using our app you can have a drone from your local pharmacy drop your medication securely to your location. ', ""PharmaFly is a platform composed of three distinct applications: A mobile app for consumers, a web-based integration platform, and a flying Linux box :) Our mobile application aims to be a centralized portal which allows consumers to manage all of their medication-related needs, including but not limited to: prescription drop-off, delivery and refills. Our web platform not only enables us to relay catalog and transaction information between our database and our mobile app, it also facilitates drone communications over HTTP for on demand deliveries! Both of these applications rely heavily on different web technologies such as: HTML 5, CSS, Javascript ES6, Python Flask, Gunicorn, and a multitude of NCR's REST API's.Finally, our drone is the centerpiece for our platform. Utilizing a Navio2 Raspberry Pi shield, our drone is a fully functional Linux box (WITH WINGS!!!). Our current software stack of: Raspbian, Mavproxy, INAV, Ardupilot, and ROS offers the freedom to connect with virtually any API or cloud service. Our current automation process allows a consumer to order their prescription medicine, have their information looked up and parsed from NCR's databases, and then uses Google Maps Geocoding API to automatically generate precise mission plans that allow any Ardupilot-based drone to fly waypoint to waypoint without a human pilot! "", ""The biggest challenge we faced during this hackathon was due to our flight controller short circuiting on Saturday night. A large amount of time went into attempting to repair the drone, but when it seemed our hardware may have been damaged beyond a Saturday night's repair, we had to push back the development of our automated delivery system. "", 'We believe that one of our biggest accomplishments is that we recognized how much it costs for a person to get out of their house and get their groceries, medicine supplements. etc. And from that view, we see the importance that a drone would save a lot of commuting time for a person in a day. We overcame our comfort-zone in many aspects. The group has a diverse skill from web development to data science, etc. We had a chance to share the skills and learned from each other what we were uncomfortable with before. We had several challenges during the process in the last 2 days. However, we were flexible and in-cooperated well enough to overcome those obstacles. And finally, we have the demo reflects well with our ideas. ', ""Not only did we learn new technical skills, we also were forced to improvise when our drone delivery platform no longer was able to utilize drones for delivery... We were able to establish a large portion of our back end services so that most other Ardupilot drones can quickly utilize our platform and deliver a plethora of goods. This process taught us how to debug hardware, and how to overcome the challenges associated with failed hardware, which wouldn't have been possible with a purely software stack. "", 'We\'ve only scratched the surface of our platforms capabilities... Not only can we eventually automate pharmaceutical deliveries, we also strive to create a peer-to-peer drone delivery market where individuals can ""rent"" their drones by downloading our software, picking up, and delivering virtually any good that NCR can provide information on! Machine vision is also another possible application in the consumer world. An idea we initially had was to use machine vision to automate food delivery and drink refills inside of large restaurants, resulting in savings for businesses and customers alike!

"PETA virus","A malicious Windows encryptor","[5197, 'The PETA virus is inspired by and shares many characteristics with the infamous Petya ransomware that infected many Windows PCs just three years ago. The issue is that this ransomware will allow you to recover your files that it encrypts, albeit at a cost, and in addition, it has been cracked and a master key is available that will decrypt most versions of the ransomware. So, for this project, we decided to turn Petya, an infuriating but recoverable ransomware into a completely irreversible and malicious piece of code that causes fatal damage to Windows PCs. And it can all happen simply by plugging in a flash drive. ', ""The PETA virus is a portable piece of malware injected onto a flash drive that can be started by simply opening a malicious executable disguised as a convincing PDF persuading the user to open it. Once a gullible victim opens the file, the executable launches, enabling another one to cause the MBR to be overwritten and the Windows system encrypted. While the payload operates, performance of your PC will drastically drop and applications will run slower. Shortly after, the PC will crash and a Blue Screen of Death will open. When the computer is reset, Windows will no longer boot. Once this happens, the malware's work is complete. And to think all of this can be prevented by simply refusing to open a PDF just adds insult to injury. "", 'We built our app originally off of just batch code, but we quickly realized this was not a permanent or lethal enough solution. We quickly turned to online repositories, and came across a 2016 trojan that did not require any administrator prompts to run or be detected by most anti-virus software.In fact, the main executable used to start the malicious code was only detected as dangerous by 10% of anti-virus software, as shown in this free online virus tester:https://bit.ly/2qdz46SWe then built our deployment method around that, disguised as a PDF. The moment the PDF is opened, malicious code wipes the Master Boot Record, rendering your computer a high-tech paperweight. ', 'User Account Control was the bane of our existence. No matter what payload we loaded, it would always demand an administrator password, not ideal for most standard users. Another problem was executing the PDF. We would have liked to have it execute the moment the USB mounts, but sadly Windows fixed that back in Windows ME. ', 'We managed to create a mass-distributive virus with relatively simple code that would destroy the computer of any of those unfortunate to open the PDFs. That alone gives us an immense sense of accomplishment. ', 'We learned that the User Account Control is one of the most useful barricades for simple malware.

We had realized that this trend was heavily influenced by posture while sitting down, especially when using electronics. With technology becoming a ubiquitous utility in our lives, our poor posture needs to be corrected before it becomes permanent and harmful to our health. That’s why we created PoseRight, a tool to monitor and encourage proper posture while sitting at a computer. ', ""PoseRight uses a camera to analyze the user's posture using the pre-trained PoseNet model. from Tensorflow. The camera is connected to a Google Coral development board, which analyzes the data from the camera to give a rating on their posture. The resulting data is sent to a server and database where it’s later retrieved by a Google Chrome extension and the website. If the extension starts to detect the user’s position is worsening, the screen will blur the tabs that the user is using. It unblurs if their posture improves. With the Coral development board, we are able to process all the data client side. This serves two main purposes, the first is that it classifies in approximately 2 milliseconds since network latency is eliminated. This speed is important when working with real time data. Secondly, it eliminates any privacy concerns as the live video feed is never stored or exposed to the internet, ensuring that you are in control of your own data. In the end, the data stored in the database is graphed in two charts, allowing the user to see their posture over time.Challenges we ran intoThere was a more accurate network architecture (ResNet50) available for Tensorflow.js, but we were unable to convert the model to conform to the Edge TPU standard. At first, we were unsure of how to interface between the three points in the project; however, in the end, we opted to use a solution where the extension and Coral board used the server as an intermediary to communicate with each other by pulling and pushing data. To link everything together, we used a Docker container, but many of our dependencies were not available on Alpine Linux which forced us to find alternatives.Accomplishments that we're proud ofWe are proud of creating a working final product that was both consistent and helpful.

"FireVision","A modern approach to forest fire detection and containment using computer vision and machine learning.","[5158, 'Fire detection systems are essential safety devices that have been around for some time now. Of these, traditional particulate-based smoke-detection devices are the most common, yet unfortunately, these are not always suitable for use in certain areas. Namely, large open areas such as national parks require staffers in fire lookout towers to observe the surrounding landscape for signs of smoke or fire throughout the year; however, it costs money and time to hire these staffers and build fire lookout towers. ', ""In response to this issue, we have used computer vision and machine learning algorithms to automate the process of surveying these kinds of areas for signs of fire. This way, only a few cameras placed sparsely apart are needed to monitor the surrounding wilderness, drastically reducing the cost of this operation. Whenever a camera sees an image that the algorithm recognizes as a fire, it notifies the central system immediately with information about the fire's coordinates, allowing rangers to respond quickly and efficiently. "", 'We tried to recognize smoke as our main part of a project, since the first indicator of a forest fire is the smoke rising from the ground. The main processing part of the project was built using Google Cloud. We used the Auto-ML machine vision library to recognize and supply the bounding boxes for any smoke that was detected. Our model was a custom trained one, which required us to upload large numbers of sample images, and manually mark them. After that was done, we simply sent a request to the Google Cloud server based on each frame of our video feed and parsed the results to display the video on our website in real-time. Another significant part of our project was the real time tracking of data that had been identified by Auto-ML. Since each camera is fixed, we know the GPS coordinate of that camera. When the camera detects smoke, a notification pops up on our website, indicating that a certain number of fires were found, as well as a detailed Google Maps panel pointing to the fires. This makes monitoring the system extremely easy.  ', 'One major challenge we faced was how our model was incorrectly recognizing background clouds as smoke. We tried a few things. First, we converted the image into binary black/white, and only recognize parts where the whiteness of the smoke was seen over the black background. This however, proved to be too unreliable due to the varying thicknesses of the smoke involved. Second, since smoke starts from the ground, we attempted to filter out results based on whether it crossed the horizon in our image, but we realized smoke that was already far up in the air would be classified as clouds in this process. We finally decided to train another model, based upon only the starting location of the smoke, intentionally capturing some of the surrounding ground in the process. This proved to be the most reliable model throughout our tests. ', 'Although we did not accomplish all of the goals we set out to do, we are still glad that we were able to get pretty far. This was the first time that both of us worked with Google Cloud, computer vision, and web development, let alone all three in the same project. We learned many new skills, such as interacting with servers, building websites, and training and optimizing machine learning models, all within a span of 24 hours. Lastly, both of us had trouble before integrating our separate parts into one coherent project, but this time, we collaborated more efficiently, and were able to do this more seamlessly due to long term planning, and preventative coding.

For the former, we had to code in three new languages, Javascript, CSS, and HTML, and we learned how data is kept secure when interacting with a server. For the latter, this hackathon was the first real exposure both of us had to computer vision, and we learned how images were represented, how to perform operations on them, image editing within python, and simple algorithms. We also had to deal with some advanced material, such as training and optimizing machine learning models, which required us to do some research into both the theory and the accepted practices that people use. ', 'Currently, the main limitation of our project is how we rely on visual data to detect smoke. This means that our ability to detect smoke during the night is severely restricted. A possible solution to this would be to incorporate not only just visual data into our algorithm, but also infrared data based on the temperature gradient between rising smoke and the air around it.

I saw my own coursemates under depression and severe anxiety. To solve this problem, I had to achieve two main things, Make sure that the people are managing their time extremely well and efficiently. Provide them a boost charge, i.e. some kind of portable therapy on the phone to keep them positive and refreshed. This inspired the creation of Project Uplift, an app to solve the most basic need for a ton of people - better time management and pressure handling.  ', 'Project Uplift allows the user to very easily write a task for themselves, complete it, and check it off! The app also includes 50 of the most authentic relaxing sounds that will calm anyone down. All this has been combined with a beautiful user interface theme to make it a powerful beast for its look and feel. There is a time constraint associated with each task that the user has to complete. This will give them the motivation to keep going and fulfill their personal deadlines on time. What if they get stressed during work? The app will remind them to take a break where they can sit back, relax, and enjoy our custom selected sounds designed for ultimate relaxation.  ', 'I built Uplift using the Swift programming language for the iOS ecosystem. Using catalyst (introduced with Xcode 11), the same app can be used to power the iPad, and even the Mac! I used UIKit framework for the User Interface and AVFoundation for the sounds. To keep track of the tasks and completion, I used the native framework Core Data. To design the entire prototype, I used Sketch.  ', ""A lot of challenges! But it's great, because I learned a lot from them. A great feature I wanted in Uplift was the ability to keep track of user's task completions. After a lot of tries, it still wasn't showing any signs of success for the implementation of the feature. But finally, going through the entire code, debugging, following the tracking functions, and a lot of web searching, I was able to get it working perfectly fine. Another User Interface problem was to figure out the best way to combine task and sound controllers. To achieve this, I had to design prototypes and wireframe on Sketch, and then convert it to the final product. In the end, I was very satisfied with the transition.

"Condo22","Improving social connections between young people virtually. Help those who are lonely to regain a sense of community.","[4178, ""The two of us were inspired by the mobile game, Tsuki's Adventures, in which the player logs in periodically to see what the rabbit Tsuki is doing. We realized that the game had a hidden allure - the game play is very simple, barely any, but it worked its way to become one of our favourites of all time. Upon reflection we realized that we loved it because the game maintained Tsuki's independence, that it is not a pet but an independent individual capable of many surprises. Our original idea was to create an app for busy families with a child living away for school. The child would update a virtual character -- like Tsuki -- to reflect their own happenings in life, and their parents would be able to peek in whenever they are free. This would be useful for busy families who would otherwise not have the time to update each other on each of their lives. In the end, however, we chose to do a different but related project that aims to connect peers. The activities people share need to be less sensitive, hence we narrowed it down to  a few categories including studying, gaming, sleeping, out of the house, and secret mode. The significance of this project is that it allows people to join a community of friends, to feel that they are not alone, even while they choose to stay home. Many of our peers tend to stay home for long periods of time, and we have felt for ourselves the sense of isolation that it can bring. Additional benefits of this project include that it allows people to form instant study groups and gaming teams, helping them further their own ventures. We chose the name Condo22 to illustrate the paradoxical reality faced by people who turn to technology for a sense of camaraderie.     "", ""We were not able to finish implementing a functional prototype. Our plan was for the app to show a user what their friends are doing at any time during the day, as long as their friends give them permission to see. We designed the UI to be centered around the Condo, in which each of a user's friends take up one floor. Each friend is represented by a doodle character, and the floors are animated to show what they are currently doing. There are settings that allow each user to customize separately what every one of their friends is allowed to see from them. One other major landmark we hoped to implement was the School, where people can be seen taking classes and exams. Our university provided us with an iCalendar export containing our timetables at the beginning of the year, and we wanted to integrate that to allow for some automatic activity updates.

"LANdmark","Simple LAN file sharing using Node.js, turning your laptop into a local file-hub.","[6525, 'In my high school, the internet connection speed is terribly slow, but the LAN connection is acceptable. This is the case for a lot of places, of OK LAN but poor Wi-fi coverage. Node.js allows a file server to be hosted on a PC/Mac/Linux machine. I have made a simple file server before, so when people all need to download some large files at the same time, they can download from my laptop at speeds higher than normal after I download it. I put installers of apps required by the school in that folder so that they can be easily accessible in my vicinity.However, this is not enough. Not only did the old program support no more than file download, but the user would also actually have to remember and input a super-long tedious URL. This project is building another platform independent of the previous one to achieve higher capacity, allowing file directory browsing (with folder collapse), file download, file upload, and a file hub function called ""peripheral"" (in beta, explained later). ', 'Download server –\xa0sharing is always welcomeHosts a server on port 3000 to serve dynamic contents from an internal directory in which the user can store his/her own files.Allows directory browsing with collapsible folders and file download links (two types, open in a new tab and direct download, for previewing files and download, respectively).Serves files from the internal directory, so that they can be downloaded by computers on the same LAN.Upload server –\xa0complementary file transfer in the other directionAllows single file uploads via an HTML form.

Its primary goal is ""one installation, multi-direction transfer"" –\xa0that is to say, turning the host\'s computer into a file hub for temporary file storage and limited and directed sharing. I named it Peripheral because it goes around the filter and folder separation at the center.With peripheral, once I launch my LANdmark, other people will be able to perform high-speed file sharing over the LAN through my machine, with the files deleted from the host after a certain delay or after a specific number of downloads (both specified, whichever occurs earlier). This would certainly lower the security measures by a limited amount, but the host will greatly help other people in the area to perform direct file sharing.As a temporary file hub, all files in Peripheral will be deleted on relaunching the server.Peripheral is currently under beta.

"ASC Protocol","Make smart contracts/blockchains able to execute themselves and automatically do things for a user that is offline","[6205, ""Inspired by GSN, which enables one to pay for another's transactions, we decided to generalize the concept of mutually beneficial transactions further. The impetus behind this is two-fold:  1. Requiring people to either be online or run bots in order to manage their blockchain accounts poses a major barrier to adoption. And 2. Remaining silo'd within our own accounts leaves a tremendous amount of value on the table that we could otherwise all benefit from.  "", ""ASC Protocol  = Active Smart Contract/Active State Change (for Cosmos) Protocol. At a high level, ASC allows you to specify conditions under which transactions can be made on your behalf, and economically incentivizes others to fund these transactions when these conditions are met. This opens up a new paradigm of possibility within blockchains. With it, in a decentralized and 100% trustless way, you can do things like:Run scheduled subscription payments that just workStop monitoring DeFi products for changes in rates. Specify your criteria and leave the rest to the bots.Regain the power to use stop-limit/stop-loss orders. There's no reason these financial instruments should be relegated to the world of centralized exchanges. Cause autonomous DAO payments, either to users such as in the case of insurance or UBI, or to oracles and other necessary public goods. We have implemented/designed this functionality in 3 ways:A1) Used ASC Protocol to add stop loss functionality to the new Cosmos DEX (link for the PR is below).A2) Aside: We have also added 2 PRs to Cosmos that should hopefully resurrect their fallen tutorials (links also below).B) Created a ManagedLendingService ASC for AAVE that removes the pressure from users to keep an eye on lending rates. C) Used ASC Protocol to design stop loss functionality for the Waves DEX## How we built it#A1)We used the Cosmos SDK and golang to create a module that allows an application to use a new stop loss order type. We also created a nice UI to show how a user would get their transaction to a relayer (described below).Transaction flow:The user finds a relayer, ideally through a web-market of relayers that have each publicly stated they are willing to hold onto transactions for competing fee rates, such as a stop loss, and watch the relevant price data until they are able to fulfill the condition of the tradeThe user signs a Stop transaction but does not broadcast it to the wider networkThe user privately sends the signed transaction in raw hex format to the chosen relayer through their chosen channel, who then stores the tx locallyThe relayer watches the relevant priceWhen the market price goes above or below the stop price (depending on initPrice), the transaction is able to be executed, so the relayer broadcasts the tx to the wider networkThe tx is executed successfully. The user has bought or sold around their desired price. Cancer is cured. There is peace in the Middle East. World hunger is no more.#B)We created solidity smart contracts that wrap the AAVE money markets to provide a ManagedLendingService. One of the problems with money markets is that they contain technical, economic, and security risk. People are interested in the high yields offered by stablecoins, but don't want to spend their days monitoring the markets for changes. The ManagedLendingService allows you to specify conditions under which your token balance can be deposited or withdrawn from the AAVE money markets, and provides an economic incentive to relayers who cause these state transitions to occur. This results in a specialization of labor that is to the benefit of everyone. More technical users are happy to build bots to watch the blockchain for profit, while more lay users benefit from the ease of use and profit margins that come from automation, causing gains in efficiency and creating value that would otherwise be lost. In addition to the deployed smart contracts, we created a nice UI that we modeled after the current AAVE UI, but with extra fields for specifying the risk tolerance of the user. We then hooked up that UI to the Kovan Ethereum testnet and integrated with MetaMask and the deployed smart contracts. It's an actual working product, end-to-end!#C)We applied the ASC Protocol to Waves to design a stop loss mechanism for their DEX, similar to Cosmos above. More advanced functionalities can also be discussed.## Challenges we ran intoUsing the web3.js library to hook up MetaMask was a challenge as it was highly finnicky. Bad practices abound on stack overflow for web3.js, such as inlining private keys in code and re-inventing the wheel for signing. Understanding Cosmos well enough to start writing code and know how it would fit into the overall architecture of a real application such as the Cosmos DEX was difficult. The tutorials for doing so had many bugs which made it take much longer than it should've, which is why we decided to submit a PR (which has been already merged!) to help others in the future. ## Accomplishments that we're proud ofMainly extending a promising protocol that unlocks functionality within the blockchain space and reduces friction, but also:Understanding Cosmos...kind of....lolBecoming an official Cosmos contributor by getting a PR mergedGetting MetaMask to successfully workCreating a really clean git repo for a hackathon :)## What we learnedThe architecture of Cosmos, how to build modules, and how those modules fit togetherMore detailed Web3.jsHow AAVE works internally## What's next for ASC ProtocolDepends if we have the funds to continue ;)Built WithgolangjavascriptreactsolidityTry it outgithub.comgithub.comgithub.comgithub.com      Submitted to    DeFi HackathonWinner                Money Legos with AAVE - AAVE                  Created by  I developed the front end and helped integrating it with the smart contracts.Hans Paul PizzininiI developed the AAVE ManagedLoanService smart contracts we deployed, and wrote the web backend in web3js to interface with them.

Currently, many small lotteries in the market are restricted by different countries or areas because transactions are hard to be tracked in a different location. Super Lottery might be able to improve this situation with its highly transparent and back-trackable features.In the future, we also want to use computer vision to register candidates' information which can significantly reduce the opportunities of typo compared with entering all the information manually.

Virtual Workshop is a tool for those who want to get introduced to robotics and are afraid to waste parts in real life. In Virtual Workshop, anything can be created and destroyed effortlessly without any worry.

"MLTonin","A productivity app to keep track of, evaluate and improve sleep cycles for those with sleep-deprivation","[5028, ' ', ' ', 'We built MLTonin in two main parts, the web interface and the background machine learning processes. The machine learning is done through an ensemble network, composed of a  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We first use a CNN as well as OpenCV to detect a user\'s facial contours and produce a predicted value for drowsiness at any given point in a session. We then pipe that information into a RNN to extrapolate user behavior for more complex analysis on patterns overtime. The data is normalized using the Wolfram api. These values are weighted and compounded into one value that describes the user\'s current energy level (from 0-10). That energy level value is sent to our firebase realtime database (which communicates this data with out front-end UI), as well as a windows-api (which automatically adjusts screen-brightness of the user\'s workspace).The web interface also has an additional CNN, built using tensorflow.js and face-api.js. This model provides expression analysis, which is used for outlier detection in comparison to the other firebase values. The web interface displays an ""Aggregated Sleep Metric"" (ASM), which is calculated by weighing the various inputs (the energy level obtained from firebase and expression analysis values from tensorflow.js) and running them through a consensus algorithm. The consensus algorithm checks relative differences and returns the most appropriate energy value with the given inputs. ', 'One of the most major difficulties we encountered is that our models was over-fitting due to the limited size of our datasets. We solved this by using different metrics (e.g., image pixel data, image contour patterns .etc) and therefore diversifying our training data.Another challenge that we ran into was getting the windows-api working. We encountered bugs interfacing the high-level python scripts with the low-level system apis. We solved the problem by finding third party libraries that skip over the low-level work and using them instead of directly accessing the system apis.What we learnedWe learned so much.

To tackle this issue, we wanted to use machine learning to help the government and farmers predict their yield at the end of each season depending on various factors such as area, season, weather conditions, Methane levels, soil quality etc. ', ""Using Machine learning, we have trained the Random Forest Regressor model on the yield that was produced in previous years as a result of input parameters such as area and season.

The concept has been demonstrated through mobile application graphics.We do wish to delve deeper than the top level prediction approach we have used.

"Emotional-Password-Protection","Real-time emotion recognition for password creation","[3952, ""We wanted to look at using machine learning for data security but couldn't pinpoint a specific area/project we wanted to attempt due to time constraints. We were cautious that we might not have enough time to design, implement, and train a classifier in 24 hours, meaning we wouldn't be able to complete the project. We thought about using facial detection as some sort of safeguard for data. We then found a pre-trained facial emotion classifier here. This model and classifier were freely available through the MIT license. We decided to look at using these detected emotions to create a unique password to protect important files. This password is unique to the emotions shown, the number of emotions, and even the duration specified for each emotion.What we learned:Through this project we learned to be patient and not give up on an idea if it seems hard at first. Initially we were dismissing a lot of projects due to their complexity. We learned that planning is vital to a project like this with a very limited time frame. Coding isn't the biggest problem in a project like this since we can look up documentation easily. The hardest part is finding a project that we can complete in 24 hours, and enjoy doing. We also learned how to allocate work appropriately and consider how difficult each task was. We had to communicate a lot during the project to keep each other updated on progress of different modules. We also did a lot of pair programming for some of the harder parts of the project, as a second pair of eyes allows us to spot errors and issues more easily.How we built it:We based the foundation of the projection on a pre-trained model and classifier found here. We used the classifier itself to detect the emotion of the user a lot better than we may have been able to do on our own. We decided to use this model because creating the model and classifier from scratch would have been incredibly challenging. We used the model to average the users emotions over a period of time, for the specified number of emotions. These averaged emotions were then double hashed using SHA-2 256 bit hashing. This generates a secure password for the user.Challenges:The biggest challenge we faced was to understand the forked work since neither of us were experienced with image classification to that level, especially since only learned a small part of classification for text. The emotional recognition was an entire level of challenge on top of the facial recognition. Finding a pre-trained model was also incredibly difficult.

"GCC Repair Utilities","small suite of software for analyzing,modding,and repairing gamecube controllers","[5469, 'I like playing video games, sometimes my controllers break so I fixed them, then people asked me to fix their controllers and add mods onto them and now I like to repair and mod controllers ', ""This is homebrew for the Wii, this software can run on a modded Wii. First piece of software allows the Wii to act as an oscilloscope reading the voltage values of the main joystick. This is used to  help identify potentiometer drift, which is when the potentiometer no longer reads accurately and the controller moves on it's own in a game. It can also be used for identifying Snapback, which is when you quickly flick a joystick and on its way back it moved to the other size and can cause an input in the opposite direction. If you were to hook up some kind of low voltage low frequency signal you could use it as a oscilloscope for other electronics, not sure why you would want to but the option is there. The next piece of software has the user flick the joystick and calculates what value of capacitor you need to remove snapback. the Snapback is essentially a short voltage spike, and using a correctly valued capacitor can bring this below the deadzone of a controller, a deadzone being the area where the values are not read. It calculates a value between .22uf to 1uf, with a good controller being listed and not needing the mod. This takes out the guesswork and expensive equipment needed to find the correct capacitor.the Third piece of software gives a graphical indication of where shield drop values are compared to the controllers values. Shield drop is a technique in smash melee but to do it consistently you need a controller with angles that let you easily hit the float values needed to do it, they few controllers have it so people can file at the plastic to make it for their controllers. This software helps people more accurately file away their controllers without messing up and wasting a controller shell.The last piece of software is a button tester, it tests most of the button inputs and shows that they are all working correctly, not much to say about this one.I also designed a pcb meant to have user adjustable capacitors with dip switches, as well as a reactive led mod to show that the information you get from my program are applicable to the modification or repair of the hardware. "", 'I spent the whole day before setting up my IDE and getting my one library that i could get to load. It took me a long time to figure out how to make a graph without any libraries or functions to help me, i ended up using a draw rectangle to make pixels, and I have those pixels map out the potentiometer values on the y axis, and 60 times a second it moves the x value to a different position so it can write there allowing for a 10 second sample with a resolution of 60hz.the capacitor mod i took a large amount of controllers and gathered the snapback values before hand and found what capacitor it needed to reduce these to under 20. The user is instructed to flick the controller left 10 times and then down 10 times, it finds the worst spike in value and it will check the data i collected as to what capacitor value should resolve the snapback and tells the user to use that value capacitor.The third one was made using sprites and drawRectangle and drawCircle functions included with the library i was using, it has one large sprite representing the gate of the controller, it has two drawCircles and a Rectangle representing the area of values needed to get a shield drop, and a circle showing where the users joystick is currently, you can compare your location to where it has to be for consistent shield drops and indicates which way to file to react that value. I have a controller i shield drop notched using an older method so i was able to gather what value it had to be and map it to my sprite+circle and rectangle.Last one I had to read through example files as there was no documentation online for how to read all the buttons.

"Hail Yeah!","The main objective of this project is to maximize efficiency in taking preventive measure for mitigating the effects of hail on airplanes on ground and mid-flight.","[6925, 'According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Severe Storms database, there were 4,610 major hail storms in 2018. The depot repair expenses of airliners caused by collisions of foreign matters are up to USD 3-4 billion each year all over the world, leading to flight delay and aviation accidents which further create immeasurable economic losses. Current preventative measures require nearly 10-15 people and approximately 3 hours to deploy covers on the airplane. Humans are exposed to severe weather during these operations. However, in-flight prevention is based around pilot procedure, “When deviating around storms, maneuver on the upwind side so wind is not carrying the storm toward you, and to avoid hail that might spew from the anvil top.” Pilots rely on weather forecast information from air traffic controller (ATC) but hailstorms can not be predicted until last minute with good accuracy. The main motivation behind this study is to maximize efficiency in taking preventive measure to mitigate the effects of hail on airplanes on ground and mid-flight. ', 'This problem is studied in two perspectives, the first case includes the preventive measures for on-ground airplanes and the second case includes risk mitigation for in flight airplanes. The on ground operations require development of infrastructure for building temporary shelters for airplanes during hailstorm. Risk mitigation for mid-air airplanes is achieved by reinforcing the critical structural components by using advanced materials. ', ""We propose a semi-autonomous rover based system which can be deployed to construct a shelter around the plane in advance once the critical weather information is received. Polypropylene material is slippery, moisture resistant and  polypropylene tarps can be used for this application. Our application requires approximately 8100 sq m material based on Boeing-747 dimensions. This material costs  $ 1.20 sq m and the tarp will cost approximately  $9700 for one shelter. The system consists of two sets of rovers on either side of the airplane. The rovers tracks a predefined way-point trajectory. The speed of the rover system is approximately 0.2 m/s, comparable to NASA's Crawler-Transporter which travels at 0.44 m/s in loaded condition. Each rover is equipped with proximity sensors for emergency braking and warning system during operation. This is a semi-autonomous system and the operator can take decisions for deployment and retraction of the system based on the weather. We have created a simulation in SolidWorks to demonstrate the basic functionality of the system and we have developed a hardware prototype of the rover too.  Risk mitigation from hailstorms during flight is proposed to be achieved by using advanced materials which can reinforce the critical components of the aircraft. The primary critical components affected by hail storms are wing leading edges, control surfaces such as ailerons, flaps, slats, elevator and rudder, fuselage nose, engine cowlings and nacelle. Graphene is the strongest material ever tested and it can provide enhanced aerodynamics capabilities. We have created some CAD designs to show this application on actual aircraft components. Graphene based aircraft has already been flight tested on a RC-plane by researchers from University of Central Lancaster in England and the system showed improved flight performance. This material definitely shows better physical and aerodynamic properties as compared to the conventional aircraft materials.  "", 'Identify the problem and define the scope of our proposed solution because we had to address on ground as well as in-flight airplanes. Coming up with a design of the shelter around the plane and operating mechanism due to large and variable dimensions of the planes. Researching a suitable material for creating tarps was also a challenge. We faced challenges in creating the CAD model animations and during preparation of our poster due to some coding issues.  The scope of risk mitigation in-flight was very large and we had to deal with trade-offs in terms of aerodynamic performance and safety of the aircraft. Researching a suitable reinforcement material was also challenging as we had to compare various physical properties wit respect to the conventional aircraft materials.

Current solutions such as hand sanitizer, antimicrobial bins, and nanotechnology mats are not systematic and miss other important areas of contamination within the airport.  With the increase in emerging infections of epidemic and pandemic status as well as increased travel due to economic development, new aircraft, and new routes added, international airports should take precautions in order to reduce the spread of deadly infections.  Public health is a field that concerns the health of all individuals and innovative solutions should be created in aviation in order to influence one of the main forms of transportation around the world. With increased security and threats of bioterrorism, international airports can be the next hub for catastrophic health crisis. We wanted to do something about it.

At the moment, we've set up the system not as an interface with any specific software, but as a demonstration of its ability to differentiate gestures. By virtue of that, we hope that its usability as a universal user interface is acknowledged.In our application, the user starts at a simple menu and can choose to define a new set of gestures or test recognition of their existing gestures. *If they choose to define new gestures, they will be asked how many gestures they want as well as what they should be called.

We wanted to be able to advocate for the LGBTQ+ and non-binary community while also building them a platform to meet new, likeminded people. In addition, to combat the fear of travelling, we generated a way for individuals to travel with other individuals to increase their comfort levels and decrease their travel anxiety. ', 'Essentially, we created a travelling website for non-binary and LGBTQ+ individuals to use and travel the world together, forming new friendships and also establishing a safe and more comforting environment for them. When first accessing the website, users will be able to enter their information (name, birthday, what they identify as, and their Facebook username), three cities they wish to travel to, and what they enjoy doing. After they input this information, their information is stored into a database where our matchmaking takes place. Our matchmaker pairs users up based on age and dream destinations. After the dream destination is set, we coded a web-scraper to find the top things to do in that dream destination. We then reach back out to the matched users with a document, showing their Facebook information so they can reach out and chat through FB messenger, and also a document depicting the top things they can explore and experience together. ', 'Half of our team worked on the front-end web development while the other half worked on the back-end. The front-end team used HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP to develop the website. HTML was used to provide the basic layout of the website, by allowing us to create input fields so that we may take in necessary user information that would be crucial for matching people up. But because HTML is just essentially a markup language we had to add some features that allowed us to actually manipulate the data in a manner that would allow the back-end team to use said data, that’s where JS and PHP came in where JS is where we performed much of the formatting and error checking for inputs, and PHP is what would create the output file that the backend team would end up using. Once we had a bit more free time or whenever we felt stuck we took the time to try and make the website more presentable through the use of CSS and it’s styling features. The back-end team used a variety of programs to create the matchmaking and web-scraping software. We coded primarily in Python and used several libraries such as Selenium and Beautiful-Soup.  ', 'Many of us had to learn a bunch of items in a short period of time. The front-end team had to learn how to write to an adjacent file in order to communicate with our back-end. This ate a lot of our time because we had to learn PHP and AJAX, which neither one of our front-end developers had used before. The back-end team had to figure out how to use Selenium to be able to find a list of the top things to do in a certain location, according to the users’ interests. Our toughest challenge however, was finding a way to integrate front-end and back-end.

', ""We learned how to use a variety of languages, including HTML, CSS, JS, and libraries, including Selenium and beautiful-soup. This was a very meaningful learning experience as we can see ourselves utilizing the languages and libraries we learned in this hackathon to future projects. In addition, we also experienced personal growth in regards to overcoming challenges. What's nextIn the future, we hope to work on making our website global. Currently, it only serves those residing in the US, however, the scalability of our project is very plausible, and with just a little more research and time, we will be able to make it accessible worldwide. To add to the user experience, we will incorporate a calendar API to help our users plan out their travel days easier and get more advanced travel matches based on compatible schedules.

"FireWatch","A realtime wildfire visual recognition tool to facilitate fast and accurate response times","[3557, ""Every year, there are tens of thousands of wildfires in the United States destroying homes, displacing populations, and leaving acres of land in ruin. Efficient and accurate wildfire detection could detect these fires before they grow to uncontrollable levels. Wildfire detection largely relies on interaction to confirm or track the existence of the fire. This leads to inefficient, low coverage detection that isn't fast enough to get a response in a timely manner. We wanted to combine visual recognition machine learning to detect fires quickly, sending an alert to our custom built web application for first responders. This continuous, smart surveillance would be cheaper and provide higher coverage than the traditional alternatives. "", 'A visual recognition AI on the Google Coral uses machine learning to classify the image it reads off the device camera. When the devices detects a wildfire, it will communicate its presence to a database. A web application reads from the database and will alert users of the wildfire.

', 'The base of our technology is the Google Coral, a machine learning, single board computer that is able to run AI algorithm to classify images remotely. We created our algorithm using TensorFlow. The Coral is outfitted with a camera to take in realtime data of its visual surroundings and send out an alert to our Azure database when it detects a fire. The database is linked to the Coral using RedNode and Watson IOT to establish the data connections, format the Coral output, and send it to database. Once it reaches the database, the information connects to a .NET MVC web application. This UI will alert users of the fire and the location, facilitating a response.

"PetGet","As of today, there are numerous concepts for rescuing people from the wake of natural disasters, but no proposals have been made on how to rescue innocent pets. It's time to stand up for the underdog.","[3977, 'Our inspiration for this project stemmed from the various ideas on disaster relief.  After taking note on previous hackathon solutions as well as other various natural disaster relief applications, we noticed a common ground: every natural disaster mitigation proposal focused on rescuing the people, but nothing on rescuing the animals.  This is where our research began, and our findings were stunning.  According to California newsletter SF Gate, a small nonprofit called Kincade Fire Pet Rescue Reunification Group has been overseeing the rescue of pets from the recent California wildfires.  In order to make their efforts as efficient as possible, they report spending roughly 18 hours a day combing through numerous social media posts, calling missing pet owners, collecting photos, and more in order to even get an idea of where a missing pet may belong.  Other similar examples include Hurricane Katrina, where nearly 16,000 pets went missing, and only 15% ever made it home.  This is a very preventable problem, and by drawing more attention to the significance of pet loss by creating an innovative solution seemed more than necessary.  ', ""It starts with the owner.  If the owner finds their pet is missing due to a natural disaster or any other reason, they would use PetGet to fill out a description of their pet, an image, as well as their last known location.  After this form is completed, local law enforcement is notified, and a post to PetGet's website is created.  Then, other PetGet users can see the listings of missing pets, sorted by the proximity between the user and the pet's last known location.  If someone believes they have found a missing pet, they can look through the local posts and find the pet(s) that best match the description of the pet they found.  They would then notify the poster about the finding, and say the pet's current location after the pet was found, whether it be a shelter, a house, a veterinary hospital, etc.  The poster would go to this location and claim their pet.  The applications of this concept are especially useful for relief agencies/nonprofits, as they can find pets in distress at a much faster rate and they can locate the pet's owner quickly and easily, allowing for more pets to be saved and more owners to be reunited with their pets.  Even everyday bystanders or pedestrians can find missing pets, allowing for a broad network of people helping the cause of caring for the pets.

"SanAir","Fly Clean!","[6264, 'Cabin Cleanliness is the 6th most common area of concern for airline customers. Some of the preceding concerns are not within the scope of the airline to address, but the airlines have full responsibility when it comes to recognizing and correcting cleanliness concerns on-flight. Airplanes also serve as an unfortunate but effective means of spreading communicable disease from either passenger to passenger or from departure location to destination. ', ""UV-C light is used to destroy 99.999% of pathogens on tray tables when they are placed in the upright position between flights. UV-C light is also used to destroy 99.999% of pathogens in the on-flight water prior to dispensation before going through a final particulate filter to provide clean water for on-flight services. An app is also available for download where the customer can track information regarding the flight's water and air quality maintenance logs, with additional information pertaining to specific technologies implemented by SanAir on-flight and other general hygiene practices for the customer to consider. "", ""The app was designed using Swift and a model of the UV-C light was created in AutoDesk Fusion360. The 3D CAD model was designed with the intention to be realistic and practical for an airline while retaining the ability to be easily manufactured and readily implemented into new aircraft. A realistic 3D model of an aircraft seat demonstrating the function of the technology was established using both stock and custom parts. The CAD model has a fully animated worm gear system that is driven by a Nema 11 stepper motor. This allows an array of custom, short-beam UV-C LED's to shine over the entire surface of the tray as it is turned into the upright position. The purpose of the array's capacity to rotate is two-fold. It allows for a smaller amount of LED's to be required to reach the entire surface of the tray, and it also hides the surface of the lenses when the tray is in the open position. The latter prevents the passenger from tampering with  or accidentally damaging the UV-C lights during flight. A worm gear was chosen for mechanical advantage in the system. Worm gears provide improved torque and accuracy while being driven, and prevent the array from being rotated by an external force from a passenger. A limit switch was also included in the design that only allows the UV-C LED's to activate if the tray is in the upright position. After assessing the difficulties in maintaining clean water on an aircraft, lack of intervention in the water filtration system was noted to be a choke point in securing potable water on-flight. New filters will be instituted to aid current UV-C technology used by newer aircraft that kill pathogens along the water feed line. There is no current mechanism in place to ensure that the water remains potable after being deposited into the plane's water reserve once it passes through the first phase of UV-C technology in place. A UV-C system will be placed into the water system between storage and access of the water. Older planes without the current UV-C technology can also be retrofitted with the UV-C light at dispensation as well. An additional particulate filter using activated carbon will be added as an additional measure to remove other organic molecules and contaminants that pose health risks to passengers. "", 'A potential concern was discovered involving an untoward effect of UV-C light in which plastic degrades over time with UV-C exposure. Ionized/Vaporized Hydrogen Peroxide were also looked at for creating an automatic sterilization system in between flights, but the procedure with the current technology at the fastest takes 75 minutes to complete.

Therefore, we decided to combine them together - giving birth to Insight. "", '10 million acres of land a year is burnt due to forest fires, and this amount is increasing yearly by 15%. Which causes a downwards spiral of higher temperatures and dry condition for even more forest fires.And the only prevention or monitoring system for forest fires are fire lookouts and satellites. Lookouts are based around human eye sight which is unreliable because only after the fire spread to a degree where it can not be stopped can they see the fire. And satellites are updated on a weekly bases due to orbits and images may be distorted due to weather and cloud cover. These two options are unreliable and only usable when the fire is so large it can be seen over a large area.

"Bio-Inspired Multi-UAV for Wildlife Control on Runways","Developing an autonomous system for a safe and efficient dispersal of animals from runway using multiple UAVs which follow a novel bio-inspired algorithm","[5009, 'Wildlife strikes in airports are increasing year over year. Current precautionary methods involve a lot of human involvement and shooting of wildlife as a safety precautionary method. We felt a need for bringing autonomy to current methods in this field. The fact that the problem was very challenging inspired us more to work on this problem. ', 'We developed an algorithm for using Multiple UAVs for surveillance of the area and animal dispersal on and near airport runways. Higher-level control of decentralized multiple UAVs will cover the entire airport area by dividing the area into segments. During surveillance, if there is any animal movement, the UAVs detect that by using computer vision techniques. This information is sent into the network. Three of UAVs nearest to the animal collaborate and form a pattern such that they scares away animals and makes them disperse in the direction away from the runway and towards a specific trap. This logic is developed from wolves hunting patterns.  ', 'We divided the whole problem into two sub-problems. Detection of animals and Deterrence of animals post detection. Detection: The area of inspection needs to be covered periodically during the patrolling. Therefore, the entire area is divided into segments and we followed the sweep algorithm for area coverage in which one UAV monitors each segment. The algorithm is designed such that each point is inspected once in time, T. During its surveillance operation, if a UAV camera detects any animal movement it tags it and follows it. Deterrence: The second part of the problem is dispersing animals away from the runway. One method that is prevailing currently is shooting the animals that get on runways but this will not preserve wildlife. Therefore, in addressing this problem, we came up with a novel technique which is inspired by wolves hunting pattern. Cristina Muro in his paper on ""Wolf-pack (Canis lupus) hunting strategies emerge from simple rules in computational simulations"" mentioned how wolves form a pattern surrounding their prey animals for chasing them down. However, our technique is designed to disperse them away from the runway. UAVs form a shape around animals within a safe distance in such a manner that animals will have only one direction to escape.  These UAVs use high-frequency sounds or flashlights to disperse animals away from the runway. We simulated this behavior using MATLAB in which results are satisfying. ', 'Initially, the problem we choose looked simple, but when we went into details we came across many problems. The main challenge is finding logic for dispersing animals without having the need to shot them. Later, while coding the developed algorithm. It is hard to incorporate all the mechanisms of UAV after further literature review we came across behavior-based robotics which can be used for this scenario.

"A for Accessibility","Keep your lectures and seminars accessible and student-friendly with this educational application!","[5768, 'There is an increasing recognition of the need to make education more accessible to students with diverse needs. The government of Ontario, for example, passed the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act in 2005 [1]. Ontario’s universities have produced a set of guidelines to help instructors make their classes more accessible [2]. Recognizing this as a step in the right direction, we were inspired to make a tool that would give feedback to instructors about their lectures, allowing them to modify it to make sure their students’ needs are being met. ', 'A for Accessibility records the audio of an educator’s lectures and analyzes it using Google’s powerful Speech-To-Text and Natural Language APIs. This analysis includes a whole bunch of important metrics carefully crafted by leading educators in order to help teachers understand the impact of their lectures on students of all types [3]. These metrics focus on tracking things like WPM [4,5], phrase complexity [6,7], and topic focus. Once the analysis is complete, the metrics are returned to the educator along with helpful tips explaining why tracking things like WPM is important, and how they can improve future lectures to make their content more accessible. In addition to this, a transcript of the lecture is returned, with questions highlighted to help the educator track common questions and address them more permanently through email or a Learning Management System. ', 'A for Accessibility is a full-stack application with the frontend made with Nuxt.js and Vuetify.js, and the backend made with Flask in Python. For our database we chose to use MongoDB Atlas. Our backend is enhanced with Google’s Speech-To-Text and Natural Language APIs to provide the analysis of audio that is passed back from the frontend, with all the computation being performed in Python. Our system was deployed through Google’s App Engine service. ', 'Constructing a full-stack application with so many moving parts is never easy. Our biggest challenge was making sure all the individual components of our application worked together properly. Another big challenge was choosing the most important indicators for accessible lectures. The solution to this problem was just extensive research! After a lot of work we were able to establish a common baseline for the most important indicators, and craft thresholds and tips to actively help educators to meet these baselines. ', 'We are very proud of our seamless end-to-end processing of audio. From recording audio on the frontend, we can pass that audio to the backend, store it, and run a variety of analysis on the audio and resultant transcript.

', 'We have addressed the aural component of accessible teaching but any lecture can be made accessible along other dimensions as well. In the future we intend to implement a video recording of the lecture. By using machine learning tools we will analyze the video and provide feedback to the lecturer about how often they were facing students, how much they moved around in class, as well as other metrics that correspond to an accessible teaching style. Additionally, we plan on implementing a student facing service where they can submit written questions to the instructor during the lecture. The timing and topics of these questions would allow the lecturer to determine difficult areas in the lecture they need to revisit. This feature will be particularly helpful for larger classes where every student may not have the opportunity to ask questions.Repetition of the core themes of a lecture and contextualizing concepts with examples are key features of more accessible teaching. We plan to implement more rigorous content analysis of the lecture to allow us to automatically detect when a lecturer repeats a theme from the lecture or provides an example.References[1] https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/05a11[2] http://www.accessiblecampus.ca/tools-resources/educators-tool-kit/teaching-tips/creating-accessible-lectures/[3] Centre for Teaching Excellence, University of Waterloo, ""Lecturing Effectively in the University Classroom.""[4] Dale, Edgar, and Jeanne S.

', 'An increased number of passengers especially during the peak time period is a serious problem for airports because not all airports are designed to serve passengers beyond the threshold point which causes congestion and the number is expected to be on the rise over the coming years. Our goal is to explore ways to improve Customer Experience (CX) but still be profitable for both the airport and the airlines. Our focus areas are to enhance the travel experience from the moment the passenger booked his/her flight. This can be achieved by monitoring human behavior and communicating it in the right way to reduce congestion by using Machine Learning techniques. ', 'Better communication, accommodation, and compassion will greatly improve the Customer Experience. We aim to achieve this by equipping the airline company with a fleet of semi-autonomous vehicles that have the capability to scan the baggage and weigh it while kept in the boot of the car. This way, the passenger is alerted about the presence of banned stuff like more than 100ml of liquid, sharp objects which otherwise have to be thrown away by the TSA while screening. This might be heartbreaking when passengers have to throw away valuables when unknowingly packed into the luggage. With these semi-autonomous vehicles, the presence of these substances can give the passenger an option to return it to their pickup location.A multi-vehicle path planning algorithm schedules the order of pickup for multiple customers A MATLAB algorithm is used to schedule the pickup time for each passenger so that not all the passengers arrive at the same time to the airport This is achievable by a fee that a user can pay to arrive at a time closer to their flight departure time to avoid waiting at the airport for about 3 hours The airline personnel then sends a text to the passenger and the pickup time by the airline owned vehicle The passenger then loads their baggage into the trunk. Now, the passenger has the option to either check-in their baggage by themselves which has no fee or to opt for the enhanced passenger experience by paying a fee which speeds up their wait time at the airport cause the check-in would be done by the airline personnel as the weigh-in and baggage screening is done at the car itself Another solution to reduce congestion that we have implemented is by using a neural network to train the algorithm using a data set that has the data for ~20 hours of passenger entry and exit for every time period throughout the day. Once the algorithm is trained, it can predict the number of passengers at each time step for the next day.

"Flock","Hurricane Dorian took over sixty lives in the first two weeks. Our project will help these people when they need it the most and no one else can by quickly restoring communications following disasters","[4740, ""When doing research for already implemented solutions to solve communication restoration challenges for disaster sites we came across Google's solution, Project Loon, which restores LTE to large areas using weather balloons and satellite communications; however, it comes with a two week delay in response time. After further research, we realized that the first two weeks are the critical response window where matters are life and death for victims of the disaster. For example, during Hurricane Dorian over 60 people passed away in the first two weeks. It was incredibly apparent a tool for first responders needed to be created to aid people in need immediately after a disaster. "", ""Our solution will serve as the bridge between the disaster and when Project Loom can be deployed by providing a communication solution for the disaster site with at most a latency of 1 hour from flock deployment to when first responders get notified. This enables first responders to know exactly where the victims are, as well as, providing a message describing their current condition and how to get to them allowing responders to provide the critical life saving aid the victim's need. Furthermore, this solution will forward any text message out of the effected areas that a victim would want to send. "", ""We built this by creating a cross platform mobile app that anyone with WiFi can utilize. A victim can queue messages to be sent in this app stating whether or not the message is an emergency notification to responders or just a normal text message. When the first responders arrive on scene they select the effected area on a map and deploy a flock of completely autonomous drones that fly in a grid like pattern to collect these messages from the victims. Next, when a communication drone flies over the affected area the queued messages are automatically transmitted to the drone via it's wireless access point and stored on the drone's internal cache. Once the drones finish their patrol they fly back to the first responder who loads the messages onto their computer using our custom made application where messages are parsed dropping pings onto a map so first responders know the state of the victim and their precise location, and forwards the text messages to the given phone number via a satellite internet connection on the first responders computer. "", ""Developing the algorithm the autonomous drone flock uses to patrol an effected area making sure to keep the distance to the patrol site, the size of the patrol site, the current battery percentage, the speed they need to fly at in order to collect the messages, etc in mind. Developing the application that sits on a Raspberry Pi, as well as, configuring a Raspberry Pi to automatically pick up messages from the mobile application on the WiFi enabled devices.

However, after getting started, we realized that there wasn't much documentation online for generating (or detecting) haikus from Javascript code, so one of our biggest challenges was creating that algorithm from the ground up. On the front end, our main challenge was fine-tuning the Web Speech API to work exactly as we wanted, and creating a great UI that isn't too over-the-top or overwhelming for the user.

"D.O.O.M.B.A.","An open source flexible robot arm for the development and implementation on various platforms. From robots that spread butter to minimally invasive surgical devices, the D.O.O.M.B.A. has many uses!","[5003, 'Today, most robot arms operate with several rigid linkages and servos moving them. What if they were not limited by these inflexible linkages and could move more similarly to a tentacle? They could be used for a number of novel applications, from fishing clogs out of drains to saving lives by assisting surgeons in minimally invasive surgery. The idea behind the D.O.O.M.B.A. is to develop an extremely flexible open source robot arm that can eventually become applicable in these situations. ', 'D.O.O.M.B.A. uses three servo motors with strings attached to pull a central spring to the desired position. Commands are sent from a computer to the system to control the speed and position of the arm. ', 'To start, the electrical system was assembled and the motors were tested. A laptop power supply was purchased to provide power to the motors and modified such that it could connect to the Arduino CNC shield. Wood for the frame was marked, cut, drilled and assembled. Next, the electronics were attached to the frame, spools were cut from a dowel rod, and affixed them to the servos. Nylon washers were drilled such that the string would pass through them and that they would fit tightly on the spring. Finally these washers were put onto the spring, string was run through them, and the spring was set in place. ', 'We ran into many challenges making this robot arm, but the main ones involved some interesting design limitations and hardware problems. The first of which was the need for a spool for the string, which was something we overlooked. We fixed this by building spools from scratch using a wooden dowel. Furthermore, we ran into some programming errors which were especially hard to debug because the software had almost no error information other than an error existed. To solve this, we went through the start up operation and checked the settings, making sure each bit was the value we needed and did some internet digging to make sure we had the right values to achieve our goal. Another problem was that we had no power supply that would fit our CNC shield. We solved this issue by buying a computer power supply and using a paperclip as the new prongs to connect the supply to the shield. We added heat shrink to give some insulation and keep the paperclip from touching itself, which when tested worked perfectly. The last big problem we had was not being able to hold the servos in a single position so that we could get the arm to hold its position. To solve this we had to set a specific field to all 1’s, which allowed the servos to be constantly fed power so that they could hold their position. ', 'At the end of this, we are happy to say we have achieved our goal of creating a truly flexible robot arm from open-source parts. It may not be quite ready for surgery, but it is a significant step in the right direction! The interface is intuitive, all parts are easily replaceable, and the arm works as intended which is wonderful. ', 'Over the weekend we learned about and improved our skills in a variety of areas including arduino, circuits, gcode, and the physical side of building the frame, arm, and joints. The kit we used was an arduino cnc kit, which used gcode an all new language that allows the programmer to give instructions to the three servos to go in three directions, X, Y, and Z. In order to work with the hardware we needed to learn more and brush up on our embedded systems skills when we had to deal with setting flags for certain pieces of functionality we wanted. Some group members also got some new experience working with hardware and circuits for the first time by helping wire everything up. ', 'The next steps for D.O.O.M.B.A. would be adding in a more natural way of controlling it our initial ideas were with potentiometers or a joystick. We would also need a better cooling system so we can go for longer periods of time before we have to cool off the board, and a more improved hardware control scheme to give more range of motion/precision to the arm.

"I'm Hungry!!","Restaurant recommendations using Collaborative Filtering with Fast.ai","[3402, ""We started off the hackathon weekend by taking a look at NCR's APIs available. We were particularly interested in NCR's Site APIs and Silver POS APIs, which is able to give us data such as nearby restaurants, restaurant items, etc. We also came to this hackathon with the intent of incorporating some aspect of Machine Learning into our project.  "", ""I'm Hungry is an app which primarily recommends suitable restaurants for users in their proximity. We trained a model using collaborative filtering built with neural networks that allowed us to make predictions of ratings based on all users' past reviews. Using this model, we can make accurate predictions about the user's preferences for restaurants. After receiving a recommendation, a user is then able to easily make reservations at the specified restaurant in his/her proximity.  "", 'The web frontend was built using ReactJS. It is hosted on Google Cloud App Engine with a custom domain.com domain. Collaborative filtering models were built with Fast.ai. We decided to host our model on an online RESTful API hosted on Microsoft Azure running on Flask using Python. ', ""We wanted to base our model on features obtained from user written reviews for the various restaurants. However, NCR's Site APIs only gave us a small sample of these restaurants, we thought that it would not be as interesting to run our model just on those few samples. Upon consulting one of the NCR staff, we were told that we could base our data on what would be obtained from NCR's APIs, and not necessarily have to use them. With this, we decided to use data from yelp.com which had tons of restaurant and review data for us to work on. Another challenge was the fact that all of us were not familiar with collaborative filtering (one reason why we wanted to involve Machine Learning in our project was to learn more about it!). We spent many hours just reading articles and trying to figure out how it works before we were even able to start coding. "", ""Training and implementing the model was not an easy task for us. We spent many hours just trying to configure the code and getting it to run and train properly. Furthermore with the large dataset, it took some time to clean and process the data before we can even start training the model.

"Liqui3D (Game of DEXes)","FOMO3D x Liquidity Mining","[5169, 'Inspired by the ""War of Attrition"" game behind FOMO3D, we built Liqui3D to allow for the bottom-up emergence of liquidity, particularly among less popular cryptoasset pairs that fall in the long-tail of all traded cryptoasset pairs on a DEX.ProtocolGame startMultiple players place trades of a given trading pair (like ETH-BTC, DOGE-ETH). The transaction fees - typically a percentage of the traded amount - associated with their trades are collected in the pot. In the beginning, the POT contains the sum of all transaction fees from all players who have placed trades of this specific trading pair. Depending on how big is your order and how liquid this trading pair is, there will be some transaction fees.The transaction fees is directly proportional to the amount being tradedThe transaction fees is inversely proportional to the liquidity of the trading pair. For example, the initial transaction fee is 1%, if only 10 trades happened in the last 5 mins, we are going to increase the transaction fee, because traders would be willing to pay a little more to make the trade happen faster.If the trading pair is very popular, like ETH/BTC, the transaction fee will be very low, because there is no need to increase liquidity at this point. The POT smart contract details the amount of transaction fees that belongs to each player. A portion of the Amount in POT continuously remains in the POT, and the remaining portion of it is given as a contribution to the global lottery pool. Game TimerThe countdown will start after a certain pot size. The init countdown is 1 minute. When any trade happens, the countdown timer will accumulate a little more time. The max countdown time is 1 hour. If there is no trade happen when the countdown comes to 0, this round ends.24 hour periodic redistribution: Local weighted lotteryThe trading transaction fees collected from all players is pooled into the local_lottery_pool. 10% of the cumulative amount from the pot gets assigned as the lottery_prize. Every 24 hours, one player out of all the existing players is randomly chosen. The chosen player wins the lottery_prize. The likelihood of winning is proportional to the player’s relative contributions to the pot. i.e. the amount of transaction fees they contributed to the pot cumulatively.P(Player1 wins) = (Player1\'s total contributions to the POT) / (Total amount in POT)Justification for local lottery vs. global lotteryA global lottery would motivate players to create new esoteric shitcoins, just so they would have a greater likelihood of winning the global lottery. By protocol, esoteric shitcoin pairs would be assigned higher transaction fees, thus building a larger pot relative to the amount being traded. A larger pot would mean the probability of winning the global lottery is higher too. Thus, global lotteries indirectly encourage the creation of new esoteric shitcoins.Justification for allocating portion of cumulative amount in POT vs. portion of trades placed in the last 24 hoursIntroducing such temporal nuances may give room for the development of attack vectors related to time of order placement. One such scenario would be when multiple players agree via an external side contract to all place their orders on the same day, such that they pump up the local_lottery_pool for the upcoming lottery. A player would agree to such a contract with the incentive being saving on opportunity cost, or effort (i.e. akin to laziness, you’d rather place a high volume of trades on the same day and take the next day off). This would drive game dynamics to entertain short spans of high trading volumes, which is undesirable as we want continuous and consistently high volumes of liquidity through time. End of gameWhen round ends, the last person who made the trade will take 50% of the pot, the 25% of the pot money goes back to the participants, the last 25% goes to the next round.If the game just goes on forever, at some point, we will distribute some of the pot money back to the participants.Next StepsValidate protocol design decisions via a multi-agent simulationBuilt WithcosmosgoreacttypescriptTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    DeFi HackathonWinner                Tendermint Cosmos Challenge              Winner                Best Project - Grand Prize                  Created by  I had a dream on Friday night and came up with this idea of Liqui3D...

Due to this, he, as well as the rest of the team, was exposed to the vast amount of greenhouse gas emission caused by the current food industry, with emphasis on the meat industry.  Seeing an opportunity to be able to help protect the Earth from greenhouse gas pollution, the team cam up with the idea of Leaf. ', 'The objective of Leaf is to promote and assist users in eating in a way that is both healthier for them and the planet. A user can enter a recipe into the app and the app will then evaluate the environmental impact of the recipe. Impact on the environment is calculated by comparing the quantity of the ingredient called for in the recipe and comparing it to the average greenhouse gas emission for processing and packaging that ingredient. The value of greenhouse emissions used to generate that amount of ingredient in the recipe is then returned to the user. This process is completed for each ingredient in the recipe and then the sum of the greenhouse gas generated by the recipe is shown to the user. Once the user is notified of the impact that their recipe has, possible substitutions can be shown for the recipe that would decrease its carbon footprint. Overall, Leaf will allow for people to make healthier food lifestyle choices by helping ease users into a more sustainable, vegetarian inspired diet. Additionally, with these lifestyle changes comes a lessened carbon footprint by finding foods that are less damaging to the environment during their production. ', 'Initial data compiling and organization was done with Python. This included using a basic web crawler to acquire pricing, food, and environmental impact data.  Additionally, this data was then converted into usable .json files to be used in the final project. Once this was completed, the back-end and front-end were constructed. To manage the dataset we compiled, we utilized a local MySQL relational database to store the information in a handful of tables. From there we set up a Spring server using Maven to create an API to access and manipulate the data from the database. Functionalities include user management and querying the database of green house gas emission records for common food options. The client side application was written for Android and features a clean, tabbed GUI. Each tab corresponds to a major function of the application. These include the home, where carbon emission statistics about the user can be observed, the ingredient replacement tab, where ingredients can be swapped out for cleaner alternatives, the recipes section, where a carbon emission score is calculated using calls to the back-end to process the food in question and finally the profile, where user settings can be found. The application features the full-stack and takes advantage of remote processing for determining clean food alternatives as well as storing user data. ', 'One of the biggest challenges we faced was when we went to connect the front-end and back-end of our app. A majority of this was due to various issues while making volley requests. One issue was syntax mismatches between the front-end and back-end which were difficult to locate, causing errors to arise when running our code. An example of this was that each end had the correct objects and attributes in the request, there were slight nomenclature issues that resulted in failure of our volley requests despite it being a subtle issue. ', 'We are most proud of the fact that we were able to complete a full stack project in only 36 hours. Our team has also learned many new skills over the course of this competition; this is another accomplishment that we are proud of. ', ""All of the team members were able to learn a new skill at this year's competition.  Matt learned how to create a web crawler that is able to take prices, names, and image URLs off of an online shopping website. In addition, he learned the basics of app development by assisting and watching team members. Sam learned how to set up both a MySQL server for a database and a Spring Boot server from scratch to create the back-end.  Jeff learned a lot about how to utilize volley and get requests to create communication between the front-end and back-end as well as the nuances of Android Studio. "", 'Once the 36 hour project version of Leaf concludes, a plethora of possible expansions are available. The ability to track how much greenhouse gas meals produce every week will be implemented and the user will also be able to set goals for emissions each week. In addition, a taste profile can be implemented which will allow for the user to indicate whether they prefer alternate meat, vegetarian, or vegan substitutions to be made into their recipes. This preference feature can also be used in order to accommodate food allergies and make recipe suggestions regarding them. Expanding beyond dietary choices and restrictions, users may choose a few favorite ingredients and have Eco-friendly recipes given to them including the ingredient(s) as a daily recipe suggestion. A final feature that the team will implement is sourcing substitutions for recipes. Once substitutions are displayed to the user, the suggestions may be clicked on to show more information.

We used this data in Google Cloud Platform's Vision service to create a custom AI model that can recognize whether a satellite image has been affected by a disaster. With this model trained, we set up a location search. This search uses US census data to determine population density for a given area.

"IDetector","Use the easy, friendly and free eye tracker to create friendly user interface using just your eyes gestures ","[3702, ""With the ever rising number of computer users, the accessibility of computers is still, to a great extent, limited to the use of traditional keyboard inputs. So, using computers for people with disabilities is either quite expensive or an unpleasant experience. We wanted to build an application that could use gestures to perform tasks without using any expensive additional tools.What It DoesThe application user your eyes gesture(more particularly your blink gesture) to perform a task in the computer. In this particular case, we will use our simple flappy bird style game called TonyHops to show the use of such a feature. A user can control the motion of the character just by blinking their eyes and thus would be great for people who are unable to use their arms. Besides, our game, the IDetector also works great with the T-Rex game from google.    How I Built itOur application uses pythons openCV library to take live feed from the users’ webcam. Then we implement the dlib library to track their facial structure. We then use a shape predictor file provided by dlib that can be used with the predictor functions in dlib library to accurately track the users eyes. Then measuring the width to height ratio of the eyes, our program makes an accurate prediction of, if the user blinked his eye. On detecting a blink, the program performs a key press(in our case the space button) which allows you to perform a certain task. The key press can be modified depending on the need of the user.Challenges I ran intoI think the biggest challenge for us was trying to run multiprocessing in python. Since playing the game requires information from the webcam feed and running the game at the same time we needed to implement multiprocessing in our program. However, we ran into a lot of errors while trying to do this. This error definitely cost our team a lot of valuable time.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofThis was the first Hackathon for our team.

We also got into simple game development with python which was a fun experience for everybody. Using Tkinter library to make GUI for python was also a new experience for us.What next for IDectetorIDetector is capable of so much more with just some timy modifications.

"I Desire Apple Pie","Constellations, Space, VR, and Neural Networks, Oh my!","[4947, 'Since the beginning of time, mankind has looked to the stars for inspiration, often leading to some of the greatest scientific and mathematical discoveries to date. Kepler, Newton, Laplace, Lagrange, and Einstein are all commonplace names in every classroom, but many would be surprised to know that their motivation for making some of the greatest advances in science and technology were born out of a desire to understand our universe and the laws that govern it. Soon, mankind will begin the efforts of colonizing other planets, and the thirst for discovery will be quenched once again. This project was born out of curiosity for what life will be like once humanity makes that step. What will we see when we look up from other planets? We wanted a way to visualize 3D space and explore the stars and constellations in a way they had not been seen before. This, coupled with the VandyHacks theme to create a work of art, led us to build the first Martian art Gallery. As Carl Sagan once said: “If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe”. ', 'A Virtual Reality experience that transports the user to an art exhibition on the Martian surface. Exhibits range from sculpture, to monuments, to 3D constellation models. The sky is made with real-time star mapping that represents what the actual night sky will look like when future Martians look to the stars. The size and brightness of each star directly correlates with the distance the star is from our Solar System and its Flux value. The simulation features narration by a neural network version of Carl Sagan, who teaches the user about a variety of concepts that will be crucial to the future of humanity living outside of the Earth system, as well as offbeat facts about some of the celestial bodies that make up many of the worlds favorite constellations. ', 'The Virtual Reality simulation was built using Unreal Engine and Oculus hardware, as well as real-time voice synthesis with small data sets, image hyper resolution neural network trained primarily on 2D data sets used to enhance textures provided by NASA and Poliigon, and style transfer with neutral network to make neat art.The star mapping was created by utilizing SPICE Kernels, ephemeris data which determines the precise location of celestial bodies in space depending on a user-defined epoch and reference frame; and Python programming. Python packages used include Spiceypy, Skyfield, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Bpy to interface the code with Blender. SPICE Kernels used include de430, naif0008, and the Hipparcos star catalog, among many others. ', 'Simultaneously running out of VRAM, RAM, GPU, and CPU power; and two complete computer crashes which resulted in file corruption. Additionally, migrating assets from Blender to Unreal Engine and finding ways to interface between all the different project segments proved to be much more difficult than previously anticipated.On the celestial mechanics side, determining the necessary SPICE Kernels required to view bodies from the Mars Barycenter, proper coordinate transformations to convert from the spherical coordinates used in the celestial models to the cartesian coordinates used by Blender and Unreal Engine was tricky to properly align, and determining how to automate the process of building spheres within Blender that correctly correspond to the size and location of stars making up various constellations. ', 'The overall aesthetic of the simulation came out great.

"Hotpot","A positive-sum smart-contract that gamifies saving ","[3584, 'Inspired by a common Chinese rotational lending game called “和会“, meaning “Rotating Credit and Savings Association (ROSCA)"" (these can also be called a \'susu\' or \'tanda\') , which is made of a group of close friends or family members. They pool their money into a common fund, generally structured around monthly contributions, and a single member withdraws the money from it as a lump sum at the beginning of each cycle. The game is heavily reliant on the trust and relationship among members because there is no central authority recording or implementing the transactions. We were also aware that many studies have shown that people are more likely to save if savings are presented in a lottery style. For example, it may be hard for someone to put aside $100 to save, but they are willing to spend that for a 1 in 6 chance at $600 which is analogous to joining a 1 month long, $100 susu (where they would be expected to win $600 twice a year).We also realized that we also had the opportunity to make this a positive-sum game by investing the pot while it is waiting to be paid out. After running some Monte Carlo simulations, we found that the average user will get paid out more than they put in, especially if they join many Susu\'s.Therefore, we decided to put this game on blockchain using a slightly modified version. Instead of one single member withdrawing the sum, we put the sum in the compound interest pool for a certain amount of time and then distribute the larger sum to a few players who win a lottery.

"SyncFast","Effectively create, share, and access presentations from the cloud","[6805, 'We understand the importance of a strong education and have seen countless newspaper articles, statistics and pictures detailing the lack of materials in third world countries. Many of the lower class children that live in poorer countries cannot receive a good education because their school cannot afford technologies such as projectors to enhance the material. Surprisingly, however, statistics show that a large majority of the world population, rich or poor, owns a smartphone. However, the current schooling system has no way to integrate this technology in teaching. In an era where exchange of data holds an infinite value, it is vital for everyone to have access to our vast technological resources. We wanted to build a system that is not only convenient for people like us to easily and quickly make and share presentation, but also build a system that allows those in underprivileged communities that cannot afford laptops or iPads to utilize their smartphones to easily access information shared by their teacher.  ', 'Our system consists of four distinct components. The website is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and gives admin users the option to create or host a presentation. To host a presentation, they connect their Google Drive account and import their presentation, where each slide is converted to a PNG file and sent to a centralized Firebase Database. The iOS app is written in Swift, Objective-C and Ruby and allows client side users to access shared presentations. They are presented with an enter code page, where they can either scan an RFID tag or input a unique authentication key. Once they are verified, they are presented with a live PNG image of the presentation pulled from the Firebase Database that updates immediately after an admin update. Another core functionality of the website is the create presentation, which uses webkit Speech-to-Text libraries and natural language processing to build a brand new presentation for you. Based on recognized speech patterns, you can add text bullets, add graphs, add images, remove bullets, import online information, etc. Lastly, a C++ based Arduino program allows client side iOS app users to easily enter presentation. By utilizing an RFID reader and HM-10 Bluetooth chip, RFID tags can be scanned and sent to the iPhone, where it is mapped to the authentication key. A user is presented feedback from a LCD, an LED, and a buzzer. ', ""We built the iOS app using Swift, Objective-C and Ruby on the XCode IDE. The app was built to support bluetooth connection to the Arduino hardware and WiFi connection to the central Firebase Database. Both base64 encoded and URL images were displayed by the app to the user. The website for creating and hosting presentations was built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. When a user created a presentation, BCrypt encryption standards were used to ensure maximum security in logins and data transfers. Flickr API, webkit Speech-to-Text and CanvasJS were used to provide basic presentation functionality. The hardware was coded in C++ on Arduino IDE. An Arduino Mega 2560, MFRC522 RFID Reader, HM-10 Bluetooth chip, 16x2 LCD, RGB LED, and buzzer were utilized for functionality. The Firebase Database served as the central cloud structure and integrated each component of our system with one another. The database stored each presentations' current slide URL as a PNG image, thus allowing users to view the current slide without a live stream, reducing bandwidth usage. By ensuring that each component was connected in a secure IoT system, we are able to provide a seamless and multi-platform system for users and admins to utilize. "", 'Our major issue was passing images to the Firebase Database during presentation creation. We had no problem converting premade Google Slides presentations into PNG images, but because our presentation creation interface was written straight in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, we were not able to effectively capture all elements (header, text, images, graphs) into a single images. To work around this, we saved two images and overlapped them to create the original. The base image contained the text in the slide and was base64 encoded and the secondary image contained the image in URL form. While this made our app slightly inefficient, this allowed users to view all aspects of the presentation while still reducing bandwidth usage.

"CalSAAS    ","A platform for connecting requesters and volunteers with a workflow pipeline and NLP integration","[4025, 'Sewa US along with Vyasa Houston & Yoga Bharati run an initiative to improve public health and provide help during disasters. They usually get requests for volunteers and as per requirements, they reach out to their registered volunteers. The problem they are facing currently is that the communication between Sewa US and volunteers is completely manual. They send out messages to their volunteers but there is no mechanism to manage the response. Also, there is no standard way of registering a volunteer or requester. Our idea is to create a common platform where all requests and volunteer assignments can be managed seamlessly with a workflow pipeline. ', ""We have built a framework to capture new requests by using the Telegram messenger in addition to the website. The chatbot gets all the details from the requester regarding their requirements and analyses the urgency status of the request using Sentiment Analysis using Artificial Intelligence. Each ticket has a field for the category which can be Disaster Management, Family Services, Volunteer Events. This request is then uploaded as a unique ticket on Trello. Each ticket flows through 4 stages: Backlog, Awaiting Approval, In Progress, Completed. A new ticket stays in the Backlog stage unless it is assigned to the volunteer. If it's a 'Family Services' request then the ticket has to go through an additional 'Awaiting Approval' stage. The next step is to broadcast messages to the volunteers added in our database based on their location and the requester's location. We have built an algorithm that keeps track of the volunteer's response and the requirement and accordingly expands its radius of location for broadcasting messages to volunteers. In order to avoid the bystander effect, we have added customized buttons to capture responses from the volunteers so that the messages are not buried down. After the volunteer requirements are fulfilled, the ticket moves to the 'In Progress' stage. This is the stage where the requester and volunteers are connected. We keep track of the progress of the task and the ticket is moved to the 'Completed' stage. We have also built a dashboard for the admin to track all the requests and their stages. We are proud of our live Maps to check the volunteers around a given radius. Our onboarding of volunteers is also backward compatible ie a simple csv upload of the existing dataset of volunteers will get them added to the database. "", 'Our chatbot works in Telegram messenger using their core APIs. We use a sentiment analyzer to understand the urgency level of the request. The responses in the messenger along with the urgency status classification are communicated to Trello using their APIs. We have used Leaflet to track volunteers and requests on the Maps.

"Weather Gecko","Gives the user a score for different activities, that could affect assets under your Geico insurance coverage, using AccuWeather API weather data.","[6164, ""As we were browsing the challenges for this semesters hackathon, we stumbled across Geico's challenge. It's goal is to bring an activity score to different activities that have something to do with the different insurance plans that Geico has. We thought this would be interesting since relating the weather to a risk factor is something we all subconsciously do when we ask for the weather in the morning, and having something to quantify it in a more specific manner sounded interesting. "", 'We thought this would be a great time to try out AccuWeather APIs to relate various weather conditions and warnings to make the score for these activities. We uses the AccuWeather APIs to gather a multitude of weather data that could give a score for some of the Geico insurance types. This combination of weather data and info on the insurance plans were put into custom functions that quantify a final score for each activity. ', ""We started off by splitting into two teams, one to understand how to use the AccuWeather API for our data collecting, and the other to figure out what data from the API had an impact on the different Geico Insurance Policies. For both of these purposes we chose to start out with Java.AccuWeatherOnce we had the understanding and initial implementation of the API, we began learning how to ping the AccuWeather site for our data and store it as usable variables in Java. We settled on using the Location, Forecast, Current Conditions, and Weather Alerts API's from AccuWeather. CalculationsMeanwhile, the other team was listing the measurements each insurance plan was affected by. Using these values, we created equations that deducted points from the max of 100 to get a final score for each insurance type. The points were subtracted based on the severity of the weather conditions. The insurance plans we settled on were Automotive, Motorcycle/ATV, Wellness and Fitness, Boating, and Air Travel. WebsiteOnce both of these were completed, we added in the data and equations to get our final values in Java. These final values were calculated on the GlassFish server via a Java Bean using a portion of the javax library. The Java Bean acts as a consolidator for all the data from the different API's.The results are then displayed to the customer on our mock Geico website. The first page prompts the user to enter their zip code and gives them a short description of the site. The Second page gives the scores for each of the insurance types and the risks of participating in those types of activities (ex. Car Travel, Boating, etc.). The Third and final page shows a breakdown of the weather conditions for someone who is also interested in the details. "", ""The largest challenge that we ran into when tackling this project was properly writing the network code in order to access the AccuWeather API. We encountered a few issues where our API key appeared to be acting up even though our request URL appeared to be correct. This resulted in us spending the first few hours trying to get any sort of response from the API. But once we got data out of the API, we weren't out of the woods yet. We still needed to take the data and manipulate it into a form we could use. We spend a considerable amount of time browsing Java libraries to find the best way to turn our data into something usable in our project plan.Another big challenge we ran into was the creation of the scales for each activity. A lot of the activities used some similar data sets but they all had their own specializations that we had to work around. The team had to come together and brainstorm/search for the danger zones of things such as temperature and precipitation. With these thresholds, we then created equations from the scores by using the data affecting the attribute of weather at maximum conditions, and equating that to a maximum score deduction (100). With this we had scaling equations for each of the weather equations. "", 'One of the things we are proud of is how quickly we got on task. Once we decided on a topic, we switched into high gear and got a lot of the groundwork started very quickly and efficiently. Because of this quick startup, it made the rest of the project when we came together and connected the two halves more manageable.Another thing we are proud of is our organization and steps we took to properly choose which weather conditions affected which of the insurance plans. This also led into creating all of our equations for the final activity ratings which, even though they were challenging, they are something that really shaped the outcome of this project.

"Braven career connect","A backend system and UI platform to connect students with career goals to professionals in those fields at a mock interview event","[6694, 'Most of us in the team are graduate students and we totally understand how important it is for students to be prepared for interviews. Getting valuable feedback from industry professionals and identifying areas to improve is incredibly important for students beginning their careers.Braven is an inspiring organization that teaches students how to pursue their career goals. The number of students they teach has been rapidly growing in the past year, and they need to update their processes to handle this expansion. One of the challenges they face is running their mock interview events. These events are an opportunity for students to get valuable time with industry experts and practice their interview skills. Braven needs an efficient way to map students to interviewers with the same interests and skillsets for mock interviews. We resonate with this idea and intend to contribute in the best ways we can.Current ProcessIn the way the system works today, the people at Braven must individually collect updated interests and skillsets from each student via email. Then they match each student with two unique interviewers, ensuring that the interviewer is scheduled to have only one student for each time slot. While this process was reasonable when they were managing fewer students and professionals, this is not a scalable solution. ', 'Our solution attempts to streamline the interviewee and interviewer mapping process in order to make it efficient and scalable. The current approach is manual and tedious in terms of time and effort. We are providing the following features:A mobile-friendly app for students to register for upcoming events based on career interests.A friendly user-interface for volunteers to mark their availability for upcoming events based on career interests.The web interfaces contain the profile info section which will capture the interests of both students and volunteers.Recommender system which will map the students with volunteers based on career interests.Event matcher logic for checking if the volunteer is available for the event or not.New career interests can be accommodated by re-training the recommender model.Scalable solution hosted on the AWS cloud.Dashboards showing statistics on number of interviews candidates attended, upcoming event slots. ', ""We used the following technologies:For Cloud Computing:AWS EC2For Web Framework:express.jsFor Backend:Node.js - for creating APIsMySql - For database storageFlask - For exposing the recommender system's APIsPython cron script - For interacting with Node.js and Flask APIs and updating event matcher dataFor Frontend:iOS -  for student appReact - for volunteer UIMachine Learning model:Recommender System "", 'Development was stalled for several hours while the PayPal firewall issue was preventing us from connecting to AWS RDS instance.

The app and website will provide them the ability to explore their career interests and quickly see relevant information about events they are attendingOur recommendation model, which uses advanced Machine Learning to offer recommendations for student-professional matches and related career interest to the students ', ""We had a great experience and learned a lot in the process. We figured out how to collaborate as a team in an efficient way to come up with an awesome solution using our diverse technical backgrounds in just few hours. We learned how to build up a complex system quickly by splitting up work and leveraging everyones' skills. We learned how to implement and integrate an end-to-end enterprise application in less than one day, build a cloud system that incorporates many individual components, how machine learning models interact with cloud systems, and decreasing the project scope given such a limited time constraint while maximizing all the time that we did have to work on the project. "", ""While we accomplished a lot during this Hackathon, there is more we would like to add in the future. We have some great ideas on Natural Language Processing regarding extraction of career interests from user-profiles, connecting the front end to more information on the backend that will reduce the work of the people at Braven and give a better experience for students and professionals.Event recommendation: Based on students' and volunteers' past history, we can gather data on similar users and recommend events for students and volunteers with similar interests.Based on users' information on career interests in the profile section, we can extract the skillset from both students' and volunteers' profiles. We can apply natural language processing (named entity recognition) and auto-fill their career interests. This would further help in increasing the accuracy of the interviewer to interviewee mapping.

"Diversify","Image-to-image translation for improved dataset diversity","[3610, ""Neural networks are powerful computer vision techniques which can map one image to another.  However, they are so effective that a new problem is rising; models are sensitive to image intensity heterogeneity.  One such example are computer vision systems which fail to operate over images of people of color, women, or those with non-traditional hair colors.The issue of neural network failure on these images lies in the dataset, as such models only will learn what they are given.  That is, the lack of diversity in machine learning datasets leads to neural networks that only make decisions based on that data.  If a neural network trains on a dataset in which all minorities are labeled as criminals, for example, then the neural network will overfit to this data and learn this mapping.  This is obviously undesirable and has heavy ethical consequences.StarGAN is a convolutional neural network model which permits style transfer from one set of categories to another set of categories.  Its ability to change a person's face, hair, age, and skin color can be a first step forward towards improving diversity in already existent datasets.  In tandem, we hope that data houses will strive to collect data which is more properly representative of the diversity we have on this planet. "", 'To demonstrate our first steps to improving diversity in human face datasets, we apply StarGAN to a live webcam feed and encourage users to toggle their visual appearance, including hair color, gender, and age.  We hope to use the wisdom of the crowd to help identify where and how our model fails to accurately apply style transfer to images.

In the traditional game, people help others playing the game by providing hints. ""Quiz Bee trivia"" too has hints when the player is stuck on a question from that particular category.  The main objective or inspiration for making ""Quiz Bee Trivia"" though burrowed from the traditional game is to create awareness of famous people, places, animals around the world and to enhance the general knowledge.

The sample pack has 3 questions from each category. If the player is stuck on a question from a particular category or chooses a wrong answer, Alexa responds with a hint. The player can also hear a different hint by asking Alexa for a hint. The player, if interested can buy the premium pack. The premium pack has 15 questions from the above  4 categories.

Also, though this trivia game is inspired from the classic paper and multiple player version, the challenge for me is to design the Alexa skill for a single player and to offer more than one hint, say additional fact about the questions in each category and anticipate the player's wrong answer. The amount of research in getting the right questions about the 4 categories is more than the amount of time spent on building the Alexa Skill with in-skill purchase.

"Victor CX","Auditory CUI for visually impaired or differently-abled users","[7758, ""There are an estimated 36 million blind and 217 million people worldwide with severe visual impairments. This represents a significant potential customer base that is currently being underserved by products and services that rely on a visual medium like web pages and visual devices like touch screens on smartphones for customer communication, information, and support. The experience of these users with products and services delivered through computing devices that have mice or touchscreens as the primary input method will always be more difficult than sighted users. People who are blind or visually impaired or disabled stood to benefit the most from the computer and information revolution and the explosion of hardware devices and mobile computer form-factors. But for these people reality has fallen far-short of expectations. It is true that GUI operating environments like Windows and MacOS and Android, and document formats like HTML and PDF have made huge strides in being accessible to visually impaired and disabled users. But user interfaces today still make fundamental assumptions about the medium of presentation of information and the mode of interaction with users, which can make using desktop or Web applications and forms or documents frustrating and time-consuming for sight-impaired users. GUI applications may conform to desktop accessibility guidelines and web-sites and pages and documents may follow recommendations like WCAG and ARIA. But navigation through desktop and web applications is still spatially oriented and visual users can see and immediately rank in importance navigation elements like windows, menus, trees, buttons, et.al while using a visual input marker like a mouse cursor to select the desired element or content. Information like calendars or tables or forms when presented visually use the visual layout as an important part of the meaning, Non-visual users who rely on screen-readers must often wade through a sea of elements and text before finding the desired function or content, and must rely on trial-and-error, repetition, and memory to be able to efficiently navigate a GUI. The increasing complexity of desktop and mobile GUIs today may benefit and seem intuitive to experienced visual users, but can also leave non-visual or differently-abled users far worse off than older interfaces. Today's complex GUIs make assumptions about the sight acuity or dexterity or short-term information processing abilities of users that can end up excluding a significant proportion of users or potential customers.Conversational user interfaces are among the easiest and most accessible forms of human-computer interaction and have seen a revival today on desktop and mobile devices powered by sophisticated natural language understanding and machine learning services running in the cloud. But most chatbots and CUIs today assume that the user can see the active conversation or activity or skill on-screen and can easily navigate and click on buttons or windows or other widgets when needed. CUIs today used to access  information like customer service may simply act as a director to web pages that are still heavily dependent on the assumption of a visual medium for presentation of information. For visually impaired users, a web pages may cause a screen reader to flood the user with information with no way to filter or narrow down what the user needs actually needs.To adequately serve the millions of blind and visually-impaired potential customers, organizations need to look beyond mere accessibility into truly inclusive interfaces that cater directly to the strengths and weaknessess of non-visual users.  Auditory user interfaces, like Emacspeak and other work pioneered by T.V. Raman can fundamentally change the customer experience for millions of non-visual users and businesses investing in this technology may find an untapped market for their products and services and a real source of brand and customer loyalty.  "", ""Victor CX is a client-server system which provides a multi-modal conversational user interface client and server back-end for interacting with an organisation's online services like product registration and on-boarding, product documentation, customer service and support, business processes like applying for a loan or for admission to a school, and other customer experience applications that traditionally rely on a user's ability to navigate a GUI and visual presentation of documents and forms. Victor CX is specifically designed for users who are blind or sight-impaired or who are otherwise not able to effectively use a traditional GUI with mouse input, and must rely on assistive technologies like screen-readers or braille displays. It uses a simplified, conversation-driven interface that can run either on a character-based terminal or in a browser as a web application. Victor produces line-by-line output that is easily read by screen readers and line-driven interactive input that can be easily entered via any kind of keyboard or character input device, or via speech recognition for users who cannot use such devices.The backend consists of a scalable chatbot server which contains the CUI logic for different bots and tracks and persists the conversation state for each client interaction witha bot, as well as as a web API which is called by CUI bots to retrieve content or run operations or interact with an organizations existing services.Victor CX let's organizations create auditory user interfaces for customer experience that integrate with existing business processes and services and content and which alsosatisfy the 7 inclusive design principlesProvide comparable experienceConsider situationBe consistentGive controlOffer choicePrioritise contentAdd valueVictor CX provides a 100% open-source alternative to proprietary CUI services like Google's Dialogflow, Microsoft's LUIS, wit.al, et.al.

Before building, we incorporated user research and dove into secondary resources, addressing three major pain points when it comes to rekindling old friendships:1) People aren\'t sure if the feelings are mutual — With time and distance in between, it can be difficult to know whether an old friend is willing to catch up with you. That\'s why, on CatchUp!, people can message each other only if they have mutually marked the other as an old friend through the ""Add Contacts"" feature, saving face and cognitive effort.2) People aren\'t sure of what to say — Too many people waste time thinking about the best approach for catching up. Using our ready-made, friendly conversation starters, users can quickly build the stage for more personal or meaningful conversations later on. Start small, end big.  3) People aren\'t sure where their old friends are anymore — When friends drift apart, it\'s hard to keep track of where they are around the world. CatchUp! saves people\'s time by notifying users when they\'re near an old friend using Friend Alert notifications. Organizing meetups or casual coffee chats with old pals has never been easier. ', 'We used Sketch to build a prototype of app UI and to create our logo. We used React Native to build the mobile application and Github to share our code. ', 'Getting all the infrastructure set up to develop this app took longer than we all previously thought. We learned the importance of planning ahead to make sure we hit the grown running (or coding!) when we meet as a team. Likewise, we also found it challenging to divide the workload into small, discrete tasks; this is an area where early planning would be a huge help. Also, although having designers and developers together was good, we had a tough time figuring out the best way to collaborate technology-wise.  ', ""CatchUp! is not your typical productivity app, but it's definitely one of the most important ones. We embarked on a unique mission—to build a tool that harmoniously blends the personal and the practical together such that more people can take control of their social lives.  "", 'We now have a better grasp of how to conceptualize a minimum viable product and to prioritize the necessary tasks and functions related to said product.  ', 'We have some ideas on how to improve CatchUp! in the future.1) Incorporating more dynamic, personalized conversation starters, such as GIFs, memes, old but shared photos/jokes.2) Using AI to make the ready-made chat prompts more user-specific (based on their Facebook profile)  ']","['adobe-illustrator', 'react-native', 'sketch', 'material-design']","False","0","['yenakim', 'jiaqigao', 'yvesshum']","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/876/670/datas/small.png","True","0"
"THAP-THAN","AGRICULTURAL WASTES TO COMPOSTE","[2530, ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'Agricultural residues or residues in Egypt are estimated at 26-40 million tons / year. This is confirmed by the statistics of the economic affairs sector in the Ministry of Agriculture and the researches of the Agricultural Research Center and the recycling thereof does not exceed only 12% of this quantity and the other millions of tons are disposed of either by burning or Throwing them in canals and banks! The same studies acknowledge the seriousness of the burning of these wastes, which lead to serious health and environmental damage. The recycling of agricultural waste, according to statistics, is easier scientifically and technologically, yet millions of tons of agricultural waste continue to accumulate in front of us every year, leaving mountains of wasted wealth that we cannot deal with only burning and managing our back with all positive solutions.The treatment of agricultural waste is limited to the traditional uses of farmers or is completely eliminated by burning and the result. A black cloud of smoke is not only caused by burning rice straw but caused by other types of waste, which causes an increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide, and therefore a rise in temperature and the consequent change in climate threatens the entire planet with the worst disasters.The phenomenon of open burning is one of the environmental problems that face the Egyptian society in all its sects. It leads to pollution of the environment by severe air pollution attacks that affect the population in the cities and villages with various respiratory diseases and acute episodes of coughing and irritation which start annually during the seasons of maize harvest in Assiut Governorate ( at Upper Egypt ) from August to the end of November. Wind activity during the fall period also leads to the spread of a black cloud that is characterized by heavy black smoke. Farmers burn residues and agricultural residues until they dispose of them, thinking they are fertilizing the land. So I should look for solutions to this problem. I am motivated to realize my dreams and to continue my studies .
