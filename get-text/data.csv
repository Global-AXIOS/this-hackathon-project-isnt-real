"CodingBoard","Improve your coding skillsets by compiling your whiteboard anywhere, anytime","[4504, 'First off, as students, with little to no time, we constantly seek resources to aid us in furthering our education. One effective method of improving our coding skill set is writing our code on paper or whiteboard. Unfortunately, this method requires more time due to the slow nature of later reviewing and rewriting the code into the compiler in order to test it. This inspired us to create CodingBoard, an image-to-code scanner and compiler/interpreter that simply takes a picture of your code and compiles it, allowing coders to test their written draft code quickly without actually typing it out.

"ReadToMe","This is a Deep Learning enabled application which is able to read books to kids","[9523, 'The inspiration behind ReadToMe came from my kids. Specifically, my younger two who are 3 and 5. Both kids love books, but they aren’t reading by themselves yet. I wanted to create something that they could use to still enjoy reading, even when a parent isn’t available to read to them. ', 'ReadToMe works by using deep learning and computer vision combined with services available in AWS. Just show the DeepLens a page you want it to read, and it reads it out loud. ', 'As simple as the workflow sounds, there were many challenges that had to be overcome to get this to work. These are the individual problems I needed to solve.Determine when a page that needs to be read is in the camera frameIsolate the Text Block and clean up the image using OpenCVPerform OCR (Optical Character Recognition)Transform text into audioPlay back the audio through speakersEach one of the above steps introduced unexpected challenges, (some of which made me question if I would be able to finish this project in time!)Determining when a page that needs to be read is in the camera frameFor the DeepLens to be able to read a page, it needed some way to know if there is something in the camera frame to read. This is where the deep learning model was used. I looked online but could not find a pre trained model that was able to classify a page in a book. As a result, I knew I would need to train a model with new data to classify this type of object.To get training data, I did a quick search online to try and find images of children’s books. I found tons of images of book covers, but practically nothing showing someone holding the book in the correct orientation for me to be able to train with. I needed images of the actual pages with text on them. Fortunately, I have four young kids, and they have hundreds of children’s books. So, one night I grabbed about forty books, and started taking lots of pictures of myself holding the different books in different orientations, lighting, and with my hand occluding different parts of the page.During this process, I started to realize that the blocks of text in these children’s books varied greatly. Sometimes the text was white on black, or sometimes black on white. Other times it was colored text on different colored backgrounds. Sometimes the text ran along the bottom of the page, and some books had text all over the page with no logical flow. So, I decided to narrow my focus and only capture images of books that had text in a “somewhat normal” positioning. I figured that if I tried to get too broad of a dataset that I would end up with a model that thought everything was a block of text. Down the road maybe I can experiment with more varied types of data but for this project I decided to limit it.After I captured the data, I used labelImg to generate the Pascal VOC xml files that would be used in training.At this point, I got stuck trying to figure out how to get my data formatted correctly to be trained with MXNet. I found a few examples using TensorFlow and so that is the road I went down. I figured if I finished the project, I could always go back and get it working using MXNet if I had extra time at the end.I was able to follow one of the examples I found on YouTube and ended up with a working model that I could use to detect text on a page.Perform Optical Character RecognitionI was surprised how easy it was to integrate Tesseract into the project. Just install it on the device and pip install the python package and then the workflow was really just a single function call. You provide an image to process, and it just spits out text. I was originally going to use a separate Lambda function with Tesseract installed to perform the OCR, but I ended up just including it in my main Lambda function because it was simpler and cut down on traffic to and from AWS. The actual OCR didn’t seem to take up too much compute power and compared to the round trip to AWS, the time seemed to be comparable. Plus, now I am doing more ""at the edge"" which is more efficient and costs less.There was one gotcha with Tesseract. It is very picky about the image quality. I had to spend a considerable amount of effort figuring out how to clean up the images enough to get a clean read. It also wants you to have the text almost completely horizontal, (which is pretty much impossible considering I want preschool aged children to be able to use this thing)I used OpenCV for most of this image pre-processing and after a number of iterations, I was able to produce images that were plain black and white text with minimal noise. This was key to getting this project to work. The end results were better that I expected, however, there is still room for improvement in this area.Transform text into audioThis step was the easiest of the whole project. Once I could get audio to play on the device, I was able to encapsulate this logic into a single function call which simply calls AWS Polly to generate the audio file. I never write the file to disk, I just feed the byte stream to the audio library and discard it when it’s done playing. I do have a few static mp3 files that are played on startup of the Green Grass service. I use the audio files to speak instructions to the user so they know how to use the device. I figure there was no reason to call Polly to generate this speech as it never changes so I generated them ahead of time and deploy it with the Lambda. (I love how easy it is to integrate existing AWS services into my projects!)Play back the audio through speakersGreen Grass requires you to explicitly authorize all the hardware that your code has access too. One way you can configure this through the Group Resources section in the AWS IOT console. Once configured, you deploy these settings to the DeepLens which results in a JSON file getting deployed greengrass directory on the to the device.To enable Audio playback through your Lambda, you need to add two resources. The sound card on the DeepLens is located at the path “/dev/snd/”. You need to add both “/dev/snd/pcmC0D0p” and “/dev/snd/controlC0” in order to play sound.As an aside, You will need to re-add these resources every time you deploy a project to the device. At the time of this writing, Green Grass overwrites the resources file with a pre-configured group.json whenever you deploy a project to DeepLens. Accomplishments that I\'m proud ofI was very happy with the end results of this project. In spite of having a full-time job and four kids, I was able to create something really cool and get it to actually work reasonably well in just a couple months. I have more ideas for future projects with this device and am excited to keep learning.What I learnedBefore diving into this project, I had no experience with Deep Learning or AI in general. I have always been interested in the topic but it always seemed to unapproachable to ""normal developers"". I have discovered, through this process, that it is possible to to create real useful deep learning projects without a PhD in math, and that with enough effort, and patience anyone with a decent development background can start using it.What\'s next for Read To MeI have a few ideas for improving the project. One feature I would like to add is the ability to translate the text that is read. (I signed up for early access to Amazon’s new Translate service but haven’t yet been approved.)I also plan to continue to improve my model to see if I can increase the model accuracy a bit as well as make it work with a broader range of books.Lastly, the text image cleanup function function, which feeds directly into Tesseract, can be improved. Specifically, it would be beneficial to be able to rotate and or warp the image before sending it to Tesseract. That way when a child isn’t holding the book correctly, it could still read the text. Motion blur was also a definite issue I had to contend with in image cleanup. If the book isn’t held very still for a few seconds, the image is just to blurry for the OCR to work. I have read about various techniques to solve this problem, like using image averaging over multiple frames, or applying different filters to the image to smooth out the pixels. I am sure that it\'s possible to achieve a better/faster outcome but it\'s tricky working on a resource constrained device.

I have read about various techniques to solve this problem, like using image averaging over multiple frames, or applying different filters to the image to smooth out the pixels. I am sure that it's possible to achieve a better/faster outcome but it's tricky working on a resource constrained device.

"Swop","Trustless peer-to-peer auction-based marketplace of non-refundable flight tickets","[3137, ""Being frequent travellers ourselves exploring the world full of possibilities, we have booked several flights in the past whenever there are promotional fares offered by different airlines. But more often than not, due to the busy and unpredictable nature of our jobs, our schedules change and there were some instances where we have to let go of those precious time for families and ourselves. This even causes greater pain realizing that the money used to book those flights in advance will go to waste.We value youOver at Swop, we value the money you earned from grueling hours of hard work. We understand that sometimes it is inevitable to let go of those missed flights but we are not in agreement that you should also let go of the money you used to booked them. We are providing an alternative to salvage that money so you can still use it for your future vacation plans because every one deserves a good vacation once in a while and enjoy life.How we built itWith our mantra of exploring the world full of possibilities, Swop uses the latest blockchain technology. Blockchain puts the power in people's hands while still maintaining security of your data. This enables any person with a valid flight booking to post their flights on the application and make it available for swopping without revealing your identity. This also remove the need to transact directly to the airlines as the application will do it for you.Challenges we ran intoWhile we are very hopeful of the aim of our application to help people, there is one challenge that we need to hurdle which is the cooperation of the airlines. We need the airline to open up this possibility of changing the existing booking and opening up an api for this application. At first it may look as an additional effort to the airline but we believe that this can help the airline's image to the general consumers in the long run. Airlines that participate in this initiative can provide their loyal patrons more satisfaction knowing that as a buyer of the ticket, even though schedules change, they will not totally lose their hard-earned money by providing an option to swop their tickets. The airline also can maximize their resources by flying with almost no vacant seat which is more environment-friendly.What's nextWe hope this solution will gain traction and change the way the travellers book their flights. We hope airline companies will be aligned with this proposal. We also hope that other major players in the industry, such as Amadeus, who have been providing the best industry solutions to power the travel industry to partner with us.

"EMICUS","A device that knows how you feel and keeps you emotionally healthy","[6502, 'Emotions that we keep boxed-up and don’t express – whether we choose to or find it difficult to do so – loom to threaten emotional health down the road.Some of us just aren’t good at expressing our emotions, or even special needs that makes it especially difficult for us, so others have difficulty relating with us (autism). Some of us are far from home or from friends for long periods, so we want someone to check up on how we’re feeling (astronauts). And all of us go through rough patches at some point in our lives, so it’d be nice to have a friend who checks up on how we feel (psych patients).And all of these factors can eventually lead to people having a violent outburst or breakdown, and make us sick. We are convinced that emotional health is just important as, and in some ways even more than, physical health. The true remedy is network of people – friend and family who will check up on how we’re feeling, but we that is a privilege that not all of us have and certainly not all the time. What if, technology could be this friend that understands how we feel? ', '(Physiological mechanism) Whenever we think or feel, our neurons produce tiny electrical signals. And we can detect these signals just by placing some electrodes right onto the scalp. This is called electroencephalogram or EEG, and it paints us a picture of what is going on inside the brain. Because it’s such a powerful tool, it’s the gold standard in any neuro research from sleep studies to diagnosis of neurological diseases and coma state.The device we chose is the Muse Headband. It is a portable 7-lead EEG monitor that just comfortably slips on, fits all, and can be kept on for long times. And by processing the EEG that the Muse generates, we can understand – or at least generally categorize – what you’re feeling. The EEG measures voltage fluctuations, which have different amplitudes and frequencies. They look specifically at the gamma band, a specific range of frequency (“emotional evaluation”). ', '(Data Transfer) The real-time data from the Muse Headband is sent to the laptop over Bluetooth. We used Node JS to “chunk” the data into 30-second segments. (Signal Processing) We retrieve the EEG data from the Muse band, and extract the measurement of microvoltage measurements. The Muse SDK conducts band filtering on the dataset to remove extreme values and noises. Then, we conduct a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which gives us the amplitude and frequency of electrical signals at each data point. We average the amplitudes within the gamma wave frequency range, which results in a value called PSD (Power Spectral Density). We isolate the PSD values in the gamma band range.(Baseline Establishment) According to numerous peer-reviewed research articles, it has been found that high PSD is caused by generally unpleasant emotions (low valency), and low PSD is caused by generally positive emotions (high valency). Each person has slightly varying PSD values, so for each subject we need to establish a baseline. The emotions studied (happy, anger, confused, disgusted) were simulated by showing video clips. Future PSD values are categorized into positive and negative emotions using statistical analysis.(Server-client Model) After the signals are processed, the data is transferred to AWS EC2 Server. The server communicates with the client, which is the mobile app in this scenario. We created a Emicus.tech domain for our sponsor, .tech.  ', 'Among the challenges we ran into were the signal processing aspect. The Muse Headband actually has a lot more variables, including accelerometer data. Isolating what we needed specifically was an initial challenge. Another major challenge was interpreting the EEG data. However, we were able to find papers and MATLAB toolkits that allowed us to perform these complex calculations such as FFT and PSD easily.We were fortunate enough to be allowed to use the Muse Headband and Amazon Echo from MLH.  ', 'We are particularly proud of our real-time monitoring function and our mobile application. The real-time monitoring had high accuracy in many subjects, often even before baseline testing. We are also proud of our mobile application (JavaScript) and the fluidity of the UI.  ', 'We learned how physiological phenomena are extremely complex, yet there are incredible tools out there from hardware, functions and toolboxes that allow us to peek into the inner workings of human physiology. ', 'In the immediate term (days), we want to make the Epicus much more accurate. We could use these datasets to drastically improve our accuracy and sensitivity by using machine learning. We found a few research labs that publicly share EEG data categorized by emotions. However, they required us to return a signed confidentiality form to gain access, which was not possible over the weekend in a limited timeframe. And as the headband is becomes more widespread, we would have access to more EEG data that is specifically generated from Muse.In the short term, we could improve our mobile app to introduce another stakeholder. For instance, in cases of autistic children or psychiatric patients, it would be important to also develop a monitoring application on the guardian or caregiver side via a secure pathway.Also, we could integrate this technology to a smart-home environment. Based on the mood of the user, the physical environment could adapt spontaneously (lighting, music, etc.). In the long term, we envision that EEG sensors will improve significantly. This will allow for a device that is very low profile that is even more user-friendly, and has a higher sensitivity and accuracy.

', 'There are three main parts to this project:Framework used for automated running of unit tests and logging.Custom activity package that plays essential part in running of Framework and Unit Tests both.Unit Test Template used to easily make a Framework ready unit tests.FrameworkFramework automatically runs all unit tests present in the Test_Repository folder. For each test run, the Framework outputs test logs that can be used for debugging in case of a failed test or errors.It is made to be plug and play.No configuring is required.It can be seamlessly integrated into any project or framework.It automatically detects unit tests that hadn\'t implemented Assert Unit Test activity.Custom Activity PackageCustom activity package Custom.Activities.VariableComparer.x.x.x.nupkg contains custom code and activities used in both Framework and Unit Tests (for source code please check Custom Activity Repository).Custom activity package contains:Custom Assert class that contains various static methods used for evaluating outputs of the tested code:Assert.AreEqual(expected,actual) checks if two variables are equal.Assert.AreNotEqual(expected,actual) checks if two variables are not equal.Assert.AreSame(expected,actual) checks if two variables point to the same reference.Assert.AreNotSame(expected,actual) checks if two variables do not point to the same reference.Assert.Contains(expected,actual) checks if first variable is contained inside of second variable.Assert.NotContains(expected,actual) checks if first variable is not contained inside of second variable.Assert.IsNull(actual) checks variable is null.Assert.IsNotNull(actual) checks variable is not null.Custom Exceptions that are thrown by Assert methods and used by a Framework for logging:AssertException is main exception thrown by Assert methods.AssertNullException is exception thrown when Assert.IsNull or Assert.IsNotNull method returns false.CustomAssertException is generic exception that is thrown when random boolean expression that returns false is passed to Assert Unit Test activity.Custom Assert Unit Test activity used as container for writing Assert methods (used when making unit tests) and also by a Framework as a soft test validation (Framework checks if .xaml file in Tests_Repository folder is a real test or not by looking if it had implemented this activity). Unit Test TemplateFrom the developers standpoint, main effort needs to be put into the writing of the unit tests.Luckily, a master template for Unit Tests is supplied with the Framework to make this process quicker and easier.Along with the master template, a few examples are also supplied, and can be used as a start point for the developers not yet familiar with the unit tests.Unit Test Template is not mandatory to be used. Developers can make tests in their own way as long as Framework requirements are satisfied, meaning:Every test has to have implemented Assert Unit Test activity.In case these arguments are not present Framework is programmed to ignore the test and log it as an error.Quick GuideInstall custom activity package (Custom.Activities.VariableComparer.x.x.x.nupkg) that comes with the Framework and can be found in the root of the directory. Installation is performed by placing .nupkg package into the %localappdata%\\UiPath\\app-xx.x.x\\Packages folder and installing it using Package Manager from inside of UiPath.Using Unit Test template (Tests_Repository\\UnitTestTemplate\\MethodName_StateUnderTestExpectedBehavior.xaml_) make Unit Tests.Unit tests must implement Assert Unit Test custom activity to be eligible for running in Framework (is implemented by default in the template file).Place Unit Tests into the Tests_Repository folder.When RunAllTests.xaml is started it will run all tests that are found in the Tests_Repository folder.To integrate TestingFramework into another project copy whole folder to the target project root directory. (Optional) When integrating TestingFramework into another project, delete project.json file from TestingFramework folder (if present).(This is more of a quality of life improvement. For people that open .xaml from the directory itself. If you have integrated framework into another project, and you open RunAllTests.xaml directly from directory (while project.json is present in framework root) it will count TestingFramework as a standalone project and you will not be able to see parent project files inside of UiPath ""Project"" sidebar).

"Remi","If we can improve medication adherence, we can decrease hospitalization, physician visits, and lower healthcare costs","[3908, 'Yitaek went to Nepal after the devastating earthquake last April and saw that people couldn’t get access to hospitals because all of the roads were destroyed. Despite the terrible conditions, villagers even in the remotest regions were still able to use their phones to communicate. From this experience, he saw the potential of telemedicine via text messaging as a reliable mode of communication. Even in the US, most people prefer to get notifications over text messages compared to other mediums. Because we are constantly overflooded by huge amounts of information, we tend to miss little details. In the realm of healthcare, this applies to prescription adherence, which we often overlook as a non-issue. However, prescription nonadherence costs the medical industry $100 billions a year, despite being an easy issue to fix. So we decided to build Remi, the chatbot that reminds you to take your medication through a medium that you will actually use and is more reliable than the internet.  ', 'Remi is a chat bot programmed to remind you to take your medications and refill your prescriptions, answer questions about your prescriptions, and document your adherence behaviors.

"Phishing for Good (P4G)","An integrated software &amp; hardware platform that allows volunteers, fishers, researchers to report ghost fishing gear","[9595, 'We tackled Problem Statement #5: Ghost Gear. We identified with this problem as it is very applicable to Hong Kong waters. Hong Kong experiences an annual loss of $7.4 million through ghost fishing (2009 figures); the Hong Kong government has spent hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money yearly, since 1998, to hire external agents to clean up marine waste on its shores. Throughout the development phase, we tried to answer two questions:How do we identify ghost gear effectively?How do we trace ghost gear back to its origin?The solution we drew up, Phishing for Good (P4G), is an integrated software and hardware product that allows NGOs, volunteers, tourists and fishers to quickly and simply trace back a piece of ghost gear to its origin. Our smart IoT solution (smart gear tags) coupled with advanced technology (specifically image processing and machine learning) allows us to relatively accurately predict data, which we can then translate on a high-level onto a real-time heat map.Volunteers have an incentive to use our app, as the information input procedure is simplified and made intuitive. Local governments have the chance to engage in environmental conservation of their waters through utilizing our app. Large- and medium-sized fisheries are given the opportunity to engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and to claim increased profit, due to the decrease in the scale of ghost fishing - an unfortunate byproduct, among others, of ghost gear.Ultimately, our predictive technology allows stakeholders to identify what we call ghost gear “prone zones” across seas, improve awareness of potential ghost gear-related hazards and increase opportunities for timely gear retrieval.Phishing for Good (P4G) can address the suggestions made by the United Nations Food and Agriculture (UNFAO) by firstly seeking out partnerships with fishing gear manufacturers to deploy smart tags, then by liaising with local governments to encourage logging of ghost gear, both found and lost gear, through employing a “no-blame” policy. This is because we believe that aggregation of data deserves priority over penalizing of offenders.In this way, we believe that with the cooperation of relevant stakeholders, we have in our hands a valuable piece of technology that has the ability to maximize its potential in providing real impact to the fishing industry. ', 'There are three main functions: Report Found, Report Lost and My Gear. Under Report Found, perhaps the key functionality, the app user fills in four key entry fields, namely: location found; type of gear; sub-category of gear; and gear color. Once we are able to secure buy-in from gear manufacturers by way of deploying smart tags on fishing gear, we can utilize image processing using IBM Watson to enable one-step information input.Report Lost functions in a very similar manner. The My Gear functionality allows fishers and other stakeholders to keep easy track of their gear by registering gear details, or by logging the details of the smart tag.  The smart tag deployed on nets and other gear incorporate simple hardware: a low-cost accelerometer that complements our app. The tag, along with real-time data of ocean currents, allows us to map a probability model of where the gear was first lost and its likely trajectory. We can display this information on a heat map that serves as a visual representation of all the features of the app.These features allow fishers and other stakeholders to report both lost and found gear so that ghost gear hopefully spends minimal time in the ocean and also has a chance to be cleared away by clean-up agents. ', 'We built an Android application that allows divers and NGOs to report ghost fishing gear that they find. In order to facilitate the tracking of the smart tags which we incorporate in our idea, we created our own algorithm based on the Extended Kalman Filter with a gain which is regressed over various samples of traced paths through a Grid Long Short Term Memory network. The algorithm makes use of an Inertial Measurement Unit’s data integrated in terms of acceleration, and also cached forecasted water current data to gain a fairly accurate approximation of the smart tag’s position over time. The hardware prototype was made using an Arduino and MPU6050 IMU for the dead reckoning calculations. We also made a RESTful API for the backend using MongoDB and Deployd & hosted on Heroku. ', 'As our solutions integrates software with hardware, one of the main challenges was to come up with a solid vision of our technology. In order to build a reasonable model, we had to decide specifically the functionality of each component of our prototype, and figure out, how to make them feasible. In particular, we had to decide how to relate the mathematical model for predicting the possibility of having a particular piece of ghost gear in some area (heat map) to the software solution (platform) for reporting found items by volunteers and divers. In addition to that, we had to work out the value proposition of our solution for the users, the fisheries, and the government. Overall, the ideation process was the major challenge for our team. ', 'We are proud of our teamwork: both the tech and business parts were well analyzed, so we were able to differentiate ourselves from other teams in all aspects: from our tech slant approach to our pitching.It took some time for us to structure all the information in an interesting, pitch-friendly manner and to create a solution based on a complicated algorithm. However, as we allocated adequate resources to every challenge we aspired to solve, we were able to excel in all of our tasks. ', 'One of our major learnings was realizing and understanding real challenges faced by the fishery industry, specifically in Hong Kong. Below are a few points of note:Despite the number of awareness campaigns and programs, most people are still unaware of the long-term consequences of these issues.Interestingly enough, losing fishing gear can cause just as much harm as capturing too many fish.Ocean currents are strong enough to move cement blocks the size of a tank. Therefore, ghost gears are likely to end up in places that are far away from the point where it was lost – posing threat to rare aquatic species.A huge database does not necessarily mean it gives you what you are looking for. At the same time, look at data for long enough and you’ll probably find what you need. ', 'Phishing for Good (P4G) currently uses open source data collected from Adrift.org (for probability values of ocean current drifts at particular lat/long values) and earth.nullschool.net (for real time values). The future, as we see it, is to work around linking these data sets to improve the accuracy of our data model, as well as using image processing and machine learning techniques to further simplify the identification process.In terms of implementation of the product with fishing nets and getting fisheries/manufacturers involved, we are looking to appeal to the government as suggested by UNFAO (United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization) to bring about a regulation for all involved manufacturers to adopt the proposed technology.

"Pallete","Tongue controlled technology for SCI independence","[2953, ""Currently quadriplegics do not have a mobile, discreet method of finely controlling the technology used in their daily lives. We envision a tongue interface capable of controlling technology to enable more independent living. The tongue is one of the most sensitive and versatile muscles in the body, it is also concealed within the mouth. Though previous attempts of using the tongue as an interface for technology exist, none of them have succeeded in achieving a comfortable and lasting experience for the users while enabling control of multiple technologies.Specifically for our project we wish to create a tongue interface for mouse control and juxtapose it with those of existing enabling technologies. By achieving a strong tongue interface we can extrapolate control in future iterations to motorized wheelchair control, exoskeletons to regain use of limbs, and remote control of robotic arms to aid in daily tasks. Moreover, the increased interconnectivity expected to take place with the smart homes of the future and the trend of Internet of Things will bring about new solutions in accessibility for people with disabilities, when paired with our interface.How it worksFor this challenge we developed a functional prototype of our idea. The way it works is quite simple: a computer mouse that can be easily controlled with the tongue. Using the trackpoint provided, the user can move the cursor around, and by pressing the 2 buttons he can do left click and right click. By enabling this functionality, our interface enables its user to perform any task that an able-bodied person can perform using a conventional computer mouse.Challenges we ran intoTaking old laptop parts and adapting them into a small, simple, and easy to use device.Creating the form of the device to be fit inside the mouth.Creating the interface to control the mouse with the device.Accomplishments that we are proud ofAfter many hours of hard work we were able to connect the device to the computer and use it as a mouse.

"", 'Inspired by lackluster lectures and little to no interfacing time with professors, LectureBuddy allows students to signal their instructors with teaching concerns at the spot while also providing feedback to the instructor about the mood and sentiment of the class. By creating a web-based platform, instructors can create sessions from the familiarity of their smartphone or laptop. Students can then provide live feedback to their instructor by logging in with an appropriate session ID. At the same time, a camera intermittently analyzes the faces of students and provides the instructor with a live average-mood for the class. Students are also given a chat room for the session to discuss material and ask each other questions. At the end of the session, Lexalytics API is used to parse the chat room text and provides the instructor with the average tone of the conversations that took place.Another important use for LectureBuddy is an alternative to tedious USATs or other instructor evaluation forms. Currently, teacher evaluations are completed at the end of terms and students are frankly no longer interested in providing critiques as any change will not benefit them. LectureBuddy’s live feedback and student interactivity provides the instructor with consistent information.

"MyHealth","Beyond Patient Portal","[6933, ""We work with healthcare providers towards reaping benefit from smart devices right from strategy to its implementation. While working with several healthcare providers, we observed that they are mostly focused on EMR/EHR and patient health information management. On the other side of spectrum, there are lot of vendors who are providing generic  solutions for wellness.This is resulting in abundance of digital solutions however most of them are not fulfilling the need to having a healthy life. With myHealth we plan to take a holistic view of health and work with healthcare provider towards providing a unified view of people's health right from illness to wellness.Another market driver for this particular solution is towards penalty on patient readmission. With mobile becoming a virtual companion of life, we believe this solution as first step towards better quality of life by bringing ecosystem players including healthcare provider, family members, domain experts together under a single umbrella of myHealth. How it worksSome of fundamental thoughts that we are trying to address include:Peronsalization and Context awareness is key in today's work of content, data and applications. There is lot of opportunity published in terms of content, applications so in today's its important to provide access to what is relevant for user rather than serving generic content. Here's some key aspects considered in solution:User interface is based on age group of user. Fonts are big and specific instructions are there in user interface designed for elderly where as same application if someone starts in younger age group the user interface is verbose with medium size fonts.Application serves content based on user's health persona. It shows digital articles which are relevant to self or near and dear ones. So a 60 year old will get more content right from screening requirements which is relevant to his/hear health condition.Context Awareness - Pill reminders, procedures are aware about your location, time and activity you are performing so instead of reminding you of taking pill, user can configure it to remind when user is at home.Each individual has their own definition of healthy life: A 60 year old might want to different health goals compared to that of a 25 years old professional. Personalization makes it possible for all age groups to achieve their goals under one platform.Breaking Stereotype roles: Rather than attributing user with predefined roles like physician, patient, care provider, In this application we intent to consider user as persona playing multiple roles together. So a physician can also have his or her health profile and use this application as a step towards better health like any other user.Healthcare Providers are going to play a additional role of digital health adviser for staying healthy. Although with digital information becoming available  Patients are getting empowered however from a trust perspective, people do rely on their physician as a authority.

"Resistora","Image recognition resistance finder","[2923, ""For Sean and Neerajen's final project for their AP Physics C course, they had to build a digital seismograph. This project involved many Integrated Circuit chips, PCBs, and resistors. Lots of resistors.There were so many resistors in so many different values such that the progress on the seismoeter grinded to a halt. They had to consult a table every time to solder a resistor in. And they didn't finish the seismograph.But with an app that could tell them the value of the resistor, they would have been able to finish their project. So to prevent any future encounters with resistors, we as a team decided to make Resistora: the image recognition resistance finder.How it worksThe app's UI is quite simple. Open resistora, and align resistor with the two lines in the center of the app screen. Our manually overrided camera control algorithm will zoom in and take a picture for image processing and calculation, which will then be displayed at the bottom. Challenges I ran intoWorking with RGB and hue was very difficult. It is difficult for a computer to differentiate between colors such as Red, Orange, Brown, and Gold. As such, we tried multiple methods to identify the location of the colored bands on each resistor - such as Floodfill, normalizations, and transformations. Ultimately, we were able to find a way to identify the colors and its location using a graphing technique, and local maxima.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofWe used our knowledge from AP Physics to find an efficient solution to image processing. Firstly, each column was averaged. Then, the lightness and saturation were calculated from the image. One interesting thing we noted is that at each band on the resistor, the saturation value would spike. This would mean that all we would have to do is find the local maximas and then find the rgb values at those locations. However, this would occasionally produce false positives which were eliminated by using the lightness data. Whevener the lightness dropped, creating a local minima, this would indicate a band.

"A DID for every thing - Agile Driving Data Chain","Safer &amp; better mobility through verifiable, blockchain-enabled Driving Event Data Chains.","[20266, 'Driven by technology innovation and ecosystem growth mobility value chains are significantly changing from monolithic, closed to distributed, open systems.Data flows are dynamically defined and stretch across multiple entities. The trustworthiness and accuracy of output data of a distributed mobility value chain is of increasing importance for the safety within a mobility system. This transformation requires new concepts of digital identity and trust for data transactions among non-human entities.Introduction - What our solution doesOur MOBI grand challenge application presents a novel approach to establish verifiable data chains for driving event data processing. This enables the verification of a given data flow and the trustworthiness of output data. As the output data are used by several mobility control, risk and business systems it is important that any entity can evaluate the trustworthiness of a given output data set.The decentralized identifier (DID) is a new open standard type of globally unique identifier that offers a model for lifetime scope, portable digital identity that does not depend on any centralized authority and that can never be taken away by third parties. We are using DIDs as a standard identifier in our solution which is supported by the W3C community.Our approach uses cryptographic data structures to link data objects and to establish a method for data flow provenance [1]. By data flow provenance we mean a mechanism for tracing data item content and control through a processing system including any transformation to the data item. This includes flows with multiple sources, collective sensor fusion and processing by machine learning algorithms. Data flow provenance means not just tracing control but also verifying the end-to-end integrity of every data flow including any transformations (additions, deletions, modifications, combinations, and ML processing).When a DID and hence data chain of the resultant data is extended to machines, the provenance chain of the data flow can provide the basis for verifiable claims and attestations about the data flow itself as well as for reputation mechanisms. These novel verifiable data chains and reputation mechanisms allow to asses trustworthiness, reliability or risk metrics of a given output of a data chain.The applications of verifiable data chains stretch across multiple use cases including real-time vehicle value, agile driving, road and obstacle mapping, usage-based insurance (UBI), data market places, reliable feedback loops into driver assistance systems (DAS) and autonomous driving infrastructures, V2V/V2I interactions and cooperative mobility systems.Benefits of data provenance along a digitized value chain include:  reliability of data and ML labels in distributed systems  increased safety  maximized efficiency with less congestion, impact, costs and better services.Our verifiable data chain concept supports the MOBI goal of the first stage to demonstrate the pieces of the BC/DLT mobility puzzle that can be used and scaled today. We suggest evaluating our proposed data chain concept as a foundational technology for the future MOBI infrastructure.How we built itDecentralized identifiers (DIDs)The resulting combinatorics of possible connections between any given set of entities in a mobility system is an impossibly large number. Yet in today\'s user journeys or business environments, agents (whether human, machine, or software) increasingly need to communicate, access or transact with a diverse group of these interconnected entities to achieve their goals. This requires an interoperable and ubiquitous method to address, verify and connect these elements together.We propose to adopt the open decentralized identifier standard (DID) as an open, interoperable addressing standard and to establish mechanisms to resolve DIDs across multiple central or decentral mobility systems [2].DIDs are the atomic units of a new layer of decentralized identity infrastructure. DIDs can be extended from identifiers of people, to any entity, thus to identify every thing. We use DIDs to help identify and manage data sets, objects, machines or software agents through their digital twins, to locations, to events, and even to pure data objects.DIDs are derived from public private key pairs. We are using innovative cryptographic solutions for secure key management by fragmenting the private key of a DID that never exists in its entirety. Our key management solution is very effective for providing very secure signing transactions e.g. for smart phones, algorithms or data sets. An integration of the key management technology into embedded devices is on our technology roadmap.A DID has the following required syntax:did:method:idstringWe are using the Ethereum Blockchain and DID method ethr for our development work.did:ethr:0x5ed65343eda1c46566dff6774132830b2b821b35As our technology stack is blockchain agnostic any other DID method based on alternative blockchains can be integrated and used.Verifiable claimsDIDs are only the base layer of decentralized identity infrastructure. The next higher layer (where most of the value is unlocked), are verifiable claims [3,4]. This is the technical term for a digitally signed electronic data structure that conforms to the interoperability standards being developed by the W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group.Verifiable claims can be either self-issued by an entity such as a machine to provide a proof about authenticity and integrity of data or they can be issued by a third party (issuer, e.g. OEM, government, TÜV, service provider, bank).In mobility systems any entity might want to transact with any other entity. This means entities are engaging with each other in a dynamically defined, on-demand way. It is not pre-defined which entities interact among each other. To ensure efficient transactions any new entity in a mobility value chain must be able to independently verify other counter parties.To achieve this objective, we are using the DID approach and are anchoring the verifiable claims on a distributed ledger technology to move the cryptographic root of trust from central systems into a decentral, interoperable infrastructure.Digital twins that are verifiableA digital twin is a digital representation of a biological entity (human, living organism, organization), a physical entity (objects, machines), a digital entity (digital asset, software agent) or any system formed of any combination of individual entities.Digital twins can represent objects and entities as varied as a IoT sensors, ECUs, spare parts, vehicles, traffic lights, access gates, human users, or a city, and everything else in between. More recently they have started to be used to represent intangible entities like services, code, data, processes and knowledge. Digital twin data can consist of any life-cycle attributes and IoT sensor, telematics or compute data.A verifiable digital twin is a digital twin with attributes that are represented by verifiable claims. These attributes such as a birth certificate, authentication proof, a calibration report or sensor data attestations can be independently verified by any third party.This type of digital twin provides verifiable data about its creation, life-cycle, sensor readings, actuator commands or transactions. These verifiable data can be used for audit trails, decision making and for feedback loops in (autonomous) control systems.Verifiable driving event data chainA data chain is a cryptographic data structure that chains signed data objects together and establishes a method for data flow provenance. Data flow provenance allows verifying the end-to-end integrity of every data flow object and its transformations (additions, deletions, modifications, combinations, and machine learning processing).Processing of driving event data is operational in multiple mobility disciplines. Driving event data processing can include multiple data sources, parties, algorithms and processing steps. A human or non-human end-user of driving event data chains needs to be able to validate trustworthiness and accuracy of data chain output data. This requirement becomes of critical importance when the output data is used in safety or security relevant use cases or to make economic decision with significant commercial values involved.For establishing a verifiable data chain, we link signed objects together. The following code snippet is a payload example with a machine learning label (red traffic light), information about the algorithm that created the label (Algorithm 1) and a link to the previous data chain block (previous block ID).HEADER: PAYLOAD TOKEN TYPE & SIGNATURE ALGORITHM{""typ"": ""JWT"",""alg"": ""ES256K-R""}PAYLOAD: DATA{  {  ""iat"": 1546724123,  ""exp"": 1546810523,  ""signer"": {    ""type"": ""algorithm"",    ""name"": ""Algorithm 1""  },  ""data"": {    ""claim"": {      ""predictionLabel"": ""red traffic light, red traffic signal, stoplight"",      ""predictionProb"": ""0.983483"",      ""did"": ""did:ethr:0xe405b9ecb83582e4edc546ba27867ee6f46a940d""    },    ""previousBlockId"": ""b86d95d0-1131-11e9-982e-51c29ca1f26e"",    ""previousBlockHash"": ""307b817de9b7175db0ded0ea9576027efd64fb21""  },  ""iss"": ""did:ethr:0x5ed65343eda1c46566dff6774132830b2b821b35""}The data chain object can be verified by validating the signature of the payload. Cryptographic data chains enable users to validate the provenance of entire driving event data processing chains including the authenticity and integrity of the input data, the output data and the provenance of sensing devices and the processing algorithms.We recommend to  establish verifiable data chains for driving event data processing,  provide a DID for every entity and data set,  integrate the data chains with DID registries (e.g. validated list of OEMs).The verifiable digital twins are addressable by their DIDs and providing information about organizations, sensors telematics devices, data sets, external data sources, software algorithms and users involved in the data chain.This approach is of particular value when validation or benchmarking data are available about the sensing devices, vehicles and the algorithms that are processing the driving event data. In combination with a reputation or validation system any user can calculate trustworthiness and accuracy metrics about the output data. For instance, data with provenance will have a much higher commercial value on a data market place.As a next step, reputation methods can be integrated for both, individual digital twins and entire data chains. Further standardization work on data chain trustworthiness and accuracy metrics need to be done.Design principlesFor our digital twin and data chain integration work we are applying the following design principles:PrincipleDescriptionFrom VINs to value chainsAbstracting the Concept of Identity to a mobility system of vehicles, IoT, road & travel infrastructure, mobility systems, ML agents, driving event data set, autonomous driving/DAS feedback loops, markets and humans. Exchanging data among those entities. E2E data provenance along a value chain.Blockchain-agnosticUse blockchain for anchoring attestations or verifiable claims. Decision on which blockchain to anchor claims based on user preferences or economic metrics such as Tx costs. Use of fiat-backed stable coins for micropayments.Scalable integrationIntegrated technology stack consisting of off-chain data structures, serverless cloud infrastructure, secure key management, DIDs, ML agents, sensor data, data chain fusion and blockchain connectors.Responsibility SegregationImplementation of this common pattern for micro services design that supports scalability and maintainability of our solution.StandardsUse of existing W3C, Industry 4.0 and Automotive data standards and semantic models to ensure adaptability and portability of our solution.Business valueFocusing on simple data integrity and authenticity problems within existing value chains. Retrofitting of existing infrastructures to scale adoption.Agile driving event data chain for MOBI grand challengeAgile driving events can be divided into two groups: (1) the interaction between a driver’s vehicle and the road environment, and (2) the interaction between a driver’s vehicle and nearby vehicles [5].Diverse methods for enhancing driving safety have been proposed. Such methods can be roughly classified as passive or active. Passive methods (e.g., seat-belts, airbags, and anti-lock braking systems), which have significantly reduced traffic fatalities, were originally introduced to diminish the degree of injury from an accident. By contrast, active methods are designed to prevent accidents from occurring. Driver assistance systems (DAS) are designed to alert the driver - or an autonomous driving module - as quickly as possible to a potentially dangerous situation.The two classes of driving events may occur simultaneously and lead to certain serious traffic situations. Automotive industry is working on active methods and systems including machine learning algorithms to analyze these two kinds of events and determine dangerous situations in agile driving from data collected by various sensors and data from external sources. The machine learning output labels about dangerous curves, road obstacles or poor vehicle conditions are fed into control, transaction and risk systems. In distributed mobility systems the trustworthiness and accuracy of the output labels must be independently verifiable.Key question: How can I trust vehicle identity data, 3rd party data and machine learning labels that are created and processed along a distributed mobility value chain?To achieve trustworthiness of output labels we are planning to blend our verifiable data chain technology with historic driving event data and black box algorithms to build a verifiable driving event solution:  Interoperable decentral identity and verifiable digital twinning protocol  Cryptographically secured and blockchain-enabled data chains  E2E integration of remote sensing (telematics) data and machine learning algorithmsOur approach demonstrates how the following trust problems can be addressed with DLT:  Vehicle provenance and configuration  Provenance, verifiability and integrity of the driving event input data (or telematics data)  Integrity and transparency of driving event data chain when multiple 3rd party intermediaries are involved  Credentials about benchmarking of ML algorithms and training data  Aggregated accuracy and trustworthiness of predicted ML labels and attributesChallenges we ran intoOver the course of the implementation of our verifiable data chain we ran into the following challenges: Providing DID identity to individual data sets and algorithms No reference implementations for verifiable data chains No common semantic standards for automotive digital twin Lack of validated source code for scalable issuing and anchoring of verifiable claims (>100.000 Tx/s) Getting access to sensible OEM driving event data and real algorithms Lack of E2E driving event data models and architectures (location, transport, events, processing)We solved (1.) and (2.) with our data chain implementation.

We are planning to benchmark the protocol in the next weeks.We are trying to address (5.) with BMW.  Data model implementation patterns need to be created in order to enable effective implementation of cyber physical systems (CPS). This is a general task to be done regardless of the use of DLT technology. To address (6.) we are working with the German Centre of Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) on a CPS integration methodology, a data modelling methodology and reusable data model implementation patterns for verifiable data chains.Accomplishments that we are proud ofWe accomplished the development of verifiable data chains including the following technology components:  DID manager  Secure key management  HD identity wallet  Verifiable claims  Deployment on severless cloud functions on AWS  Integration of tensor flow algorithms for image processingWe are now planning to integrate historic agile driving event data from an OEM and a black box algorithm with our existing data chain solution on Amazon Web Services.What we learnedOur primary leanings are around the following areas of interest:  Abstraction of the DID method to any object  Identity solutions for machine learning agents  Scalability of off-chain data structures  Integration of serverless cloud infrastructure with key management and identity wallets  Verifiability of data chains  Applicability of data chains for above mentioned data-driven business solutionsWhat\'s next: our broader objectiveOur broader objective is to establish a scalable digital twin protocol and a technology layer for autonomous things.

We finally decided on a minimum viable product of having locations, and ways to move between them. This was fairly simple to code and we moved on from there.Originally, we used JSON as the base of AdvLang but we quickly realised JSON syntax was not really great for what we were trying to achieve. After trying several different approaches, parser generators, and our own recursive descent parsers, we finally settled on our current approach, which we think maximises simplicity and readability.Getting curses to do the ""right"" thing was a pretty long process. We originally had the user type in their choices, like a proper adventure game, but decided that offering a menu of choices would improve the experience. Little did we realise how much work there\'d be to get a menu working inside a terminal! ', ""We're super proud to have a working engine!

"", 'KISS - ""keep it simple, stupid"". We really were way too ambitious at the beginning. Once we started working on our ""minimum viable product"", we started making progress really quickly. From there, it was much easier to extend our project to include the majority of features that we originally hoped for. ', ""We're actually planning to continue work on this after the hackathon. Firstly, we're really close to adding ASCII art and centering the output to make the interface nicer. We're also planning to create a proper (web-based) GUI for writing and playing adventures, to make it even easier for beginners to get started with AdvLang.

"NESS","An innovative system to prevent wasting water in almost any environment. Now with IoT functions","[3630, ""The idea of NESS was born in 2014, when we realized everybody hates leaving the tap open while waiting for hot water. Sure, there were some solutions, but most of them implied wasting huge amounts of energy and/or money (Resistor Heaters. additional heaters near the shower, additional recirculation pipes). That's why we created NESS. "", ""To put it simply, it saves water. And a lot of it. NESS is composed by 3 modules: A pumping module, a bypass module and an activator module. Installing the pumpling module next to the heater, and the bypass module on the furthest place of the hot water pipe, we can save ~200 gallons per household each month. Just activate the system before using the hot water, It'll move all that cold water that's stuck in the hot water pipe (the water everybody usually let go down the drain) back to the heater, while bringing hot water to any place in your home. Water will stay warm for about 20 minutes, so you have plenty of time to have a coffee or do your thing before having a shower.How does it fit in the Challenge?It's easy to get into Ness, in less than an hour you can have the system installed and working.It doesn't have any negative impact for the user. It's better to activate the system a minute before going into the shower than getting cold because of all the water you're letting down the drain.If every household in California had it, we could be saving ~81million gallons. Now, that's a lot.There isn't a lot of data of hot water usage, it's about time to fix that. We can gather a lot of data about user tendencies and installations that will help us to save even more water.This is replicable almost anywhere in the Earth. Every house with a water pipe for cold water, one for hot water and a heater can work with Ness. "", ""We started building it in late 2014, earning a lot of recognition from the University of Malaga and some other public entities. By the beginning of 2015, we had a functional prototype, and that's when we saw the Makers Against Drought announcement. We decided to give it a try and turn NESS into the IoT device we always wanted it to be. "", 'As usual with startups, money has been our biggest hurdle. We had the passion, we had the ability to create something useful, but we had little money. We could solve it by doing some other projects for other people, and while that has been fun too, it has provided us the money we needed to build this system.

"Lung Cancer Detection using Deep Learning","Pioneer lung cancer diagnosis tool. Upload CT scans &amp; get accurate cancer nodules diagnosis within minutes.","[5482, 'We identified the lung cancer is one of the most critical diseases, for the chance that a man will develop lung cancer in his lifetime is about 1 in 14 and for a woman, 1 in 17. It is crucial to detect cancer at early stage to ensure timely treatment and increase survival rates.    However, the diagnosis process is time-consuming and prohibitive, which hinders people for actively monitoring their health conditions. Furthermore, the manpower cost to hire a specialist for hospitals is costly in terms of both time and finance, with an extensive training required.    After exploring the elegance of machine learning, we believe that the deep learning methodology can contribute largely towards this pressuring issue. Within 2 days, we built LCD, an innovate deep learning tool dedicated to lung cancer diagnosis.     ', 'LCD accelerates the detection process for lung cancer. Users can simply upload CT scans to LCD website and get the diagnosis results within minutes. It not only detects potential cancer nodules, but also eliminates false positive nodules to ensure higher accuracy.    ', 'We trained the image segmentation model using neural networks, specifically, U-Net. Then we use the Residual Networks to eliminate the false positive samples. We trained the neural networks with Tensorflow framework. The model is running interactively on a GPU server. A web app is built with Python Flask framework that allows users to have minimum trouble of getting diagnosis immediately.     ', ""Time constraint for deep learning is beyond our expectation. Usually, it takes 2 weeks to train a fully functioning LCD, but we do not have the luxury of time to make a complex and sophisticated LCD from scratch within 2 days. It's depressing to realize that the sophisticated version that coders have spent the entire first-day writing might not be able to implement completely. However, we made some necessary adjustments and manage to present the first version within 48 hours.    "", ""ProductWe are proud to build a product with strong future applications and positive implications towards the society. Deep learning for cancer detection is such a fascinating field that illustrates the combination of two seemingly irrelevant areas. NYU has taught us the importance of critical thinking and cross-thinking, and we are grateful for the analytical skills as well as technical skills we manage to gain and apply. We will definitely continue exploring the field, building a version beyond the current Hackathon and bringing some positive changes to the society.   TechnologyWe have learned more about deep learning, in terms of structure and applications. The experiential learning experience enables us to apply what we're taught in school, mentors and workshops provide us with more timely advice on the product and the time constraint pushes us beyond our comfort zone (and procrastination).   TeamworkThe most importance accomplishment in the journey is the great teamwork. We literally formed the team 10min before the official start of the hackathon, and are presently surprised that we complement each other in terms of skill sets. As a three-man team, we worked coherently -Yichen did the complex algorithm, Shining built the website and user interface, and Yamei wrote the content. Although our team is smaller, we are proud that we made new friends and built LCD together within the past 2 days.   "", ""Manage your expectations and stay realistic.The first lesson is to manage your expectations realistically. Within the short duration, it is nearly impossible to achieve a final design for a tool that normally takes weeks to finish. However, going through the thinking process for the sophisticated algorithm made us optimistic about the future of LCD, and would love to continue working on it. It's good that we tried.   Persistence is the key. There are struggles and challenges, actually much more that we thought. Staying optimistic, making necessary adjustments and never giving up are the critical steps we've learned, not only for hackathons or coding but also for everything we do in life.  Enjoy the process.Doing things we love and learning new things along the way are simply amazing! The struggles we went through, the pizzas we shared and the product we built eventually are an amazing learning experience and we will do it again.    "", ""We are going to upgrade the current product and enhance the accuracy of diagnosis. We will continue research and lab experiments in NYU, consult NYU professors and mentors for future developmentMoving on, we will conduct further analysis on the market potential, competitors and industry outlook for the sector.

"MyMusicMate","Friendly chatbot that helps you and your friends find a concert to go together based on your collective music tastes!","[10669, '""So, guys, we know we all want to go to a concert somewhere, but there are just so many options to choose from!""""Yeah, and it\'s especially difficult because we have such varying tastes.""""If only there were some sort of chatbot that could take our musical preferences and somehow convert them into concert options for us…""""Wouldn\'t that be great? And imagine if the power of Amazon Lex was used to control its conversation logic!""Does this conversation sound familiar to you? Well it should now, because you just read it a moment ago. Our concert-loving group of developers wanted to create a chatbot that would not only give users concert recommendations based on their music interests, whether they be by artist or by genre, but would also help them decide as a group which concert to go to. We\'ll even throw in some live concert videos from YouTube to help them decide! ', ""MyMusicMate starts by rounding up your concert-loving friends into a Slack channel and asking about everyone's music tastes.  Folks can name artists they like, or they can simply name genres if they don't have any specific artists in mind. MyMusicMate leverages the LastFM API to help get artist recommendations based off of user input, and then asks users to specify where they're interested in going to a concert.  For now, MyMusicMate only focuses on cities within the US, but it's learning more with every passing day/commit ;)MyMusicMate then takes this information and uses the BandsInTown Concert Search API to find upcoming events and the YouTube Search API to find live concert videos to help users make their decision.  If you're unsure about whether or not you'd like to see an artist in person, maybe a video of a live concert could help!Finally, MyMusicMate takes the list of concert results and concert videos and displays them in the Slack channel, allowing users to mull their decision over and place a vote for which concert the group should go to.  And don't worry - if your group can't agree on a concert, MyMusicMate will be happy to offer new suggestions or get new musical preferences until it can find what's right for you! "", ""At its core, MyMusicMate is a Slack chatbot powered by Amazon Lex for its conversation logic. Lex intents are used to guide the user into inviting friends into a new Slack channel, gather everyone's musical tastes, and enter a location so MyMusicMate can start searching for concerts.  After the initial intent is triggered by a sample utterance, flow from intent to intent is handled by Amazon Lambda functions until concert voting is ready to begin. Once voting is complete, the application will either terminate if a success condition is met, or trigger a previous intent to gather more information from users.Our Lambda functions also use Amazon's Simple Notification Service to queue actions, post messages to Slack, and communicate with Lex without fear of any function timeouts.  Lambda functions are also used for Slack integration, aiding in app installation, event subscription, and handling of interactive messages (voting) routed through Amazon API Gateway endpoints.DynamoDB tables are used to store data that must persist through the application flow (artists, genres, concerts, etc.) and beyond (user IDs, team IDs, access tokens, etc.). Artists and genres are discarded when users have exhausted their concert options and decide to expand their search preferences, while concerts are kept until the application terminates, in order to ensure duplicate recommendations are not delivered. State (current intent, channel id, timeout) and current intent data (callback_IDs, user input) are also stored, allowing multiple users to converse with Lex freely without fear of accidentally invoking other intents.MyMusicMate leverages multiple APIs to validate user input and find events for users. The LastFM Album Search API is used to get related artists by genre, while the BandsInTown Artist and Concert Search APIs are used to verify artist names, US city names, and search for concerts by specified and related artists.  Finally, the YouTube Search API is used to search for live concert videos, after which all of the content is rolled up and passed to the Slack messaging API in neatly formatted messages.Our team used the Serverless Framework to build and deploy our application onto the AWS stack.  During deployment, we retrieve s3 bucket information from CloudFormation and upload our redirect page and images of the MyMusicMate family accordingly.  One of our developers also created a plug-in for the Serverless framework to deploy our Lex bot from a blueprint file, which is hopefully available as a npm package by the time you read this :) "", 'Our team ran into a number of challenges during development. Being a newly available technology, references were sparse so we were not able to find the exact behavior of some of Amazon Lex slot types, which led to some guesses on how user input would be interpreted. Creating a Lex intent loop was also a bit harder than expected, and we wound up using a continuous ConfirmIntent loop with multiple optional Slot Types as a bit of a hack.  As a result, we had to perform additional user input validation to ensure Lex wasn\'t registering a ""negative"" sounding artist name as a ""status denied"" confirmation, as was the case for the DJ name ""What So Not"" for example. Creating a proper timer also proved to be an issue, as we wanted to give the user an option to extend the timer while being mindful of Lex timeouts.  We eventually decided on storing the time with the rest of the ""state"" information, which allowed us to restore state without worry of intent expiration.Prioritizing concerts was also a hurdle, as we had to factor in the nature of the search result (whether it was by related artist, by genre, etc.), whether or not there was any artist overlap with previously displayed events, and whether or not the event received a certain percentage of votes in a previous round of voting.If you plan on terminating a voting process after the last vote is placed, leave a bit of a buffer for misclicks and changed opinions. People love to change their mind after a vote has been placed. ', 'First and foremost, we are proud of putting together an application that leverages a number of technologies that we had never used before (Lex, DynamoDB, Slack API, Lambda) in a short period of time.  We\'ve grown as developers, and some would say, as people. *cue awws from the audience*We were also proud of how we implemented state management with DynamoDB, storing interim event data to allow us to reliably poll users for input inside or outside of intents without accidentally invoking another intent or triggering a Lambda function.  Once we were able to control state flow, we didn\'t have to worry about how making our Lex interactions less ""bot-like"" might affect MyMusicMate\'s behavior.We\'re also pretty happy with our concert queue/voting logic.  Ultimately we wanted to give users the highest chance of coming to an agreement on which concert to go to, and this meant giving enough of a variety of concerts, setting the proper threshold for keeping or discarding events, and allowing just enough rounds of voting necessary to make a refined decision without getting stuck in a voting loop. ', 'Double-verify user input. Even if you using a pre-existing Amazon Slot type, stick a Lambda verification function behind it.Print long, print strong. If you\'re going to be manually controlling Lex intent flow, you\'ll be looking at event contents constantly.  Like, never comment out a print event statement. Ever.Be human. Writing multiple, informal intent utterances and response messages can go a long way in making bot interactions seem more ""human,"" while repeated responses or responses in ALL CAPS can result in a colder, more jarring experience for the user.People make mistakes. If you plan on terminating a voting process after the last vote is placed, leave a bit of a buffer for misclicks and changed opinions. People love to change their mind after a vote has been placed. ', 'Expand concert search.  We\'d like to accomplish this in two ways: First, we want to leverage other event search APIs, such as Songkick and Eventful, so MyMusicMate would have a greater library of concerts to parse through.  Second, we\'d like to expand support for cities outside of the US, starting with the rest of North America.Fuzzy search and related genres.  We\'d like to implement fuzzy searching to allow for more accurate resolution of misspelled genres and artist names, as well as a ""related genre"" search to be used when the current search scheme does not return a sufficient number of events.Headless browser to unfurl redirected content.  Our current ticket links contain a JavaScript redirect to each event\'s respective ticketing page.  We will use a headless browser to grab the redirect link so metadata can be unfurled inside the final Slack message.Amazon Polly Integration. . We originally planned on integrating Polly with MyMusicMate, to allow for seamless concert recommendations based on users talking to each other about their musical preferences.  Unfortunately we didn\'t have enough time to accomplish this, but we would love to revisit this idea in the future.Smarter YouTube searches.  We\'d like to redefine our YouTube search to prioritize videos from Artists\' official Vevo pages and use the YouTube Music Insights API to prioritize videos based on popularity by location, depending on the user\'s city.

"CloudIoT","All your things on the cloud","[5928, ""My first motivation was to learn meteor; create a second application. My first application is an attempt to recreate billpin which seems to be going into decay, I've publish this first app a while ago at: http://billbuz.com/.Internet of Things have been a popular topic lately and we are seeing many applications being create to monitor data streams. Since I've always been a fan of home automation and as a side hobby I build my wireless arduino sensors, I wanted to be able to track them in a convenient way. I have few Arduino with nRF24L01 and sensors which are battery powered around the house. "", ""I have few Arduino with wireless nRF24L01 which communicate using the NRF24Mesh libray (which allow routing the data through other mesh nodes) to a mesh server currently running on a Raspberry Pi. This RPI communicate to the Meteor server using C++/DDP to feed the data from all its sensors on the mesh network. Where the hackathon come in is for the the meteor part. The meteor server listen for devices feed from DDP protocol. Those feed come from any source as long as they respect the app high level RPC protocol. Then it store information about the sensors into mongo which allows clients to visualize it. It manage user sessions to allow modifying the feeds metadata that your user own.We use the userId and private key on external applications or RPI to feed the data. This is required in order to have a user owning the feed.On the client side we can see the sensors and it's data in charts. All chars are update realtime from the sensors data. Only a subset of the data is sent to the client to minimize the transfert between the server and client. For instance, when activating a feed, a subscription is made for that particular feed and providing the last X element of the collection. "", 'In this hackathon I\'ve worked only on the meteor part so I\'ll skip the C++ DDP impl and RPI/arduino communication.To prevent from having to build everything from scratch, I\'ve used as many packages as I could that would save me some time.To quickly create the UI, I\'ve looked around at other web site source HTML and CSS to ""inspire"" my design from them. To create the picture on the login page, I\'ve took a picture of the RPI with an Adruino.I\'ve done the routing with iron:router and read the tutorial which explains how to wait for data to be fully loaded before changing page, and also to have a loading screen while the initial first load.Chartist-js is an good chart package to visualize the data. It\'s been easy to integrate, but it was a bit harder to customize the way I exactly wanted it. Next time I\'ll try chart.js.Many thanks to the Meteor Toys which accelerated my development a lot. For sure I\'m going to buy it. ', ""I'm a beginer on Meteor, I've only published one app with this framework. Also, I'm not a web programmer in my full time job, I work as a game programmer on PC and console games. This lead me to time loss such as  re-reading some basic meteor stuff such as the rounting part using iron:router. Simply having a correct Html/Css layout took some precious time.Also since my artistic talent leaves much to be desired, I could not create my own textures. I had to find free textures online but ran into packages to help me such as bootstrap & FontAwesome. While designing the second page where we see graph, I lost time trying to figure out how to show the data and what I actually wanted as a final result.The usual issue, I wanted to do more than I could so I ended up with a partial application and no sleep in that 24 hour.At some point I had issue between the RPI communicating with the meteor server. I didn't want to spent time on that part in the hackathon but I had to in order to have working feeds. "", ""I managed to get the data from my Arduino sensors, to my RPI, then to my meteor server and show the sensor feeds into charts. I wasn't sure I could get there in time, but my best friend google helped me out a lot to learn the pieces I was missing on meteor/javascript/etc.Also I load only the feed data on demand so there is not a huge initial transfer.I'm not too sad about the look of the app, the login screen look good, and the feed screen is okay. Lacking functionality though. "", ""With meteor I can deliver prototypes very quickly. I don't see how I would have done it using any other framework.I've also learn some meteor basics which i didn't assimilate completly while doing my first app. "", ""I want to tweak sensors variables from the meteor web interface. It's tedious to modify the code and reupload it to aduinos each time I want to try a new values.I want to have only the owner who can see its feed. He could then share a view or a feed with someone else as he wants.I would like to have a more customizable dashboard, we decide which feed to see and in which graph we'll visualize the data.I would also like to have alert based on certain data values, and send email of sms depending on preferences.Adding a new client to feed data is not user friendly right now, I want to have this part made easier.Run your own serverThis is actually not a good idea at this point since you need your own sensors that respond to the high level RPC protocol.

"CoSine","The beautiful re-plastering of a mathematical concept into a fast paced 2d platformer. A true test of co-ordination.","[4125, 'To me there was a certain beauty to graphs - I know that sounds odd and geeky but it seemed so strange that something mathematical was in fact so in grained in our physical world. Taking this concept of waves and dynamics, it wasn\'t a stretch to create game where controlling those dynamics were the key to survival. The game:The game focuses around two waves:  i.e you. You have two possible ways of controlling them, moving them up and down; or moving them further or closer together.  You\'re objective survive. Obstacles head your way getting progressively harder and more challenging, but there are a few power-ups to help you out. As the difficulty increases and the obstacles getting harder to predict, it becomes more and more necessary to use both controls in tandem; truly testing co-ordination and reactions.How I built itThe main framework I used was SpriteKit - Apple\'s own 2d engine. I found it to be intuitive and straight-forward, making it easier to focus on the logic and maths to set up this mathematical phenomenon ;). The UI was pre-sketched in Sketch, a brilliant design tool I found to truly see how the final product would look, but I think most of all the vector drawing made the quality of the images brilliant, considering I opted for a clean, minimalist geometric style. The music was made through Garageband, and though it may not be the focus of the game it proved an adequate backing to the game. Challenges I ran intoThe main challenge on the coding front was setting up the sin wave, and making it adjustable; but more-so in a good bullet-proof system that decreased the chances of bugs and gave the user a beautiful experience. But, also I think what was harder was creating a perfect alignment system so that the spikes always aligned with the max amplitude of the wave regardless of the global step or the fps changes. But on the UI and UX front, though I got the initial idea and concept nailed out quickly actually making that happen proved quite the challenge: creating the icons, assets and most importantly colour schemes :D - it got quite tedious. The tutorial and ironing out the learning curve of the game to make it enjoyable was also very difficult. The tutorial had to be more ""walk-in"" and interactive to truly show the concept, but the passing of the game had to be right when they began. This however more challenging when people who playing the game for a while said the start became boring since it was too easy. The dilemma I still don\'t know if I have solved!Accomplishments that I\'m proud ofAs my first real project and product, I think it was a very good step. I think I was able to take a concept and deliver it into a professional looking app (I hope...). The idea I felt was novel and I think definitely was my eye-opener into app development and then I think to computer science in general. Overall, I think my proudest aspect would be the look of the game, in my opinion, it is beautiful and especially on the right device; and I feel it is a true product.What I learnedI learned a lot. In coding the most: just realising the worst method possible, was a huge improvement for me. It truly turned my attention to ""efficient beautiful"" code. However I am still shaky on being able to comment regularly, having a good naming system...But on practical aspects, I learnt the nuances and intricacies of iOS app submission: the horror of screenshot and app previews and icons. How multi-device support should be considered when the app is first built - not at the last minute. Not to leave the FPS count on in a final build ...It was truly a journey.What\'s next for CoSineI would like to expand the assets and maybe add a few game-modes. And maybe team up with other people to truly make it better in ways that I probably cannot see.

"", 'The main challenge on the coding front was setting up the sin wave, and making it adjustable; but more-so in a good bullet-proof system that decreased the chances of bugs and gave the user a beautiful experience. But, also I think what was harder was creating a perfect alignment system so that the spikes always aligned with the max amplitude of the wave regardless of the global step or the fps changes. But on the UI and UX front, though I got the initial idea and concept nailed out quickly actually making that happen proved quite the challenge: creating the icons, assets and most importantly colour schemes :D - it got quite tedious. The tutorial and ironing out the learning curve of the game to make it enjoyable was also very difficult. The tutorial had to be more ""walk-in"" and interactive to truly show the concept, but the passing of the game had to be right when they began. This however more challenging when people who playing the game for a while said the start became boring since it was too easy. The dilemma I still don\'t know if I have solved! ', 'As my first real project and product, I think it was a very good step. I think I was able to take a concept and deliver it into a professional looking app (I hope...). The idea I felt was novel and I think definitely was my eye-opener into app development and then I think to computer science in general. Overall, I think my proudest aspect would be the look of the game, in my opinion, it is beautiful and especially on the right device; and I feel it is a true product. ', 'I learned a lot. In coding the most: just realising the worst method possible, was a huge improvement for me. It truly turned my attention to ""efficient beautiful"" code. However I am still shaky on being able to comment regularly, having a good naming system...But on practical aspects, I learnt the nuances and intricacies of iOS app submission: the horror of screenshot and app previews and icons. How multi-device support should be considered when the app is first built - not at the last minute. Not to leave the FPS count on in a final build ...It was truly a journey. ', 'I would like to expand the assets and maybe add a few game-modes. And maybe team up with other people to truly make it better in ways that I probably cannot see.

"VeriRoute","Rates different routes from a source to destination  on a safety scale of 1 to 5 ","[4233, ' ', 'VeriRoute is a unique transportation application that allows users to not only identify the quickest path to their destination, but also various safety metrics that characterize each route. When their route is selected, we utilize EverQuote’s anonymous database which characterize various dangerous behaviors, such as phone usage, speeding, acceleration, and braking, along the latitude and longitude locations that characterize their route. We utilize data that represents the frequency of crime-related incidents along the route as well, and compile all of these metrics to provide a subjective, weighted score to depict the safety of each route. The aim is to provide users, particularly those unfamiliar with the areas they are venturing into, with an added measure of security.  ', ""We obtained a database from EverQuote, which contained data over a period of time that identified when people at each specific latitude and longitude location were either speeding, accelerating, using their phone, or braking. Each of these points were anonymous, and we used JavaScript to parse this data file to both obtain points within a 0.5 mile radius along the route, and applied a subjective weighting system to characterize the score based on the density of each of the four events described above. We then overlapped crime data in the same fashion, and applied a final score based on this data.Challenges We Ran Into:A major challenge we ran into that limited the reliability and capability of the application was the limited amount of data we had to work with. This made it difficult to scale our idea, since we only had a limited batch of locations and a limited time frame in which the data was collected. Another major limitation we ran into was the lack of immediate availability of comprehensive crime data. Much of this data was gathered in or around metropolitan areas, so the scope in which we could extrapolate results was severely diminished. This also offered a scalability challenge, since the scores would be skewed unfairly if the route took an individual through a major city. Accomplishments that we're proud of:We were thrilled to get the application up and running at the level it is at. Two of our team members were first-time hackathon participants, so there was a lot of explanation and instruction along with writing code and fleshing out the idea.

"AutiBot","AutiBot is a health hack capable of analyzing brain activity to detect young children's risk for developing autism.","[4746, 'Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a range of neurological development disorders including Asperger’s Syndrome and autism that affect approximately 1 in 50 American children. Although the onset of these disorders typically occurs before children are three years old, current methods to diagnose ASD at very early ages are often ineffective, depending on the observation of certain distinctive mannerisms (such as inability to make eye contact) that may not be detected or associated with ASD. Recent research studies, however, have indicated that EEGs can offer a better, more scientific diagnosis of ASD. When children are faced with the task of integrating several different visual and audial stimuli, autistic children experience significantly reduced brain activity because of their inability to quickly process these stimuli. We were inspired by the massive potential of this new technology to make the cheapest possible EEG-based ASD-detection hack. Our goal was to create a multi-sensory game integrating many different types of stimuli, such as color, shape, and sound, to determine children’s chances of developing ASD. ', 'Our hack, AutiBot, is a simple, accessible game that tests the response of young children to several different visual and auditory stimuli at once by asking them to tap certain dots on the screen. While teaching children about color, shape, number, and more, it also records the time taken by the user to respond to the stimuli and values for the EEG brain activity of the user using the Muse headband technology. Then, by running an Anomaly Prediction machine learning model based on pre-existing datasets of non-autistic , the app calculates the probability of the user developing a mental disease like Autism. The app also has features to store and display the user’s results over time in the form of graphs and recommend actions to the child’s family, like contacting a local doctor, based on the results of the autism-prediction machine learning model. ', 'We built the game in iOS using Swift. We used Microsoft Azure to create the predictive machine learning model which analyzes the cumulative data (EEG and reaction times, stored in a Parse backend) from each user and predicts the probability of developing ASD. For reading data on brain activity, we used the Muse headband technology and the LibMuse SDK.  ', 'Getting the Muse headband to work was the biggest challenge we ran into. The LibMuse SDK had no support for Swift, so we had to create bridging headers to integrate our Objective-C Muse code with the rest of the app, written in Swift, which ended up being far more difficult than we initially thought. Moreover, pairing the Muse headband to our laptops through Bluetooth was extremely challenging, which also negatively affected our ability to obtain the datasets for the Azure machine learning model. ', 'Actually finishing the hack despite the hurdles with Muse. Also, we were very happy with the UI design and the overall concept/social application of the hack. ', 'We learned how machine learning can be utilized to detect anomalies in data sets.

"Cash Only","Avoid ATM Fees with Peer-to-Peer Cash","[2269, 'You\'ve been waiting in line to get into your favorite bar for half an hour when you hear a murmur that they\'re charging $5 for cover, and only accepting cash.  Sighing, you look in your wallet, but as usual you only find cards and receipts.  You don\'t want to lose your spot, but the only ATM at the bar charges ridiculous service fees.  Ugh.With Cash Only, this is no longer a problem.  You simply pull up the app, request the cash you need, and you\'ll be matched with a nearby member of the Cash Only peer-to-peer network.  You send them the $5 plus a small thank-you bonus on Venmo, they hand over the cash, and dreading the phrase ""cash only"" becomes a thing of the past.How it worksCash Only is a mobile web app built on the Ruby on Rails framework.  It utilizes the Venmo API for person-to-person payments and Parse for its backend data.Challenges we ran intoWe spent that majority of this hackathon attempting to learn how to use PhoneGap.  PhoneGap allows developers to write apps in HTML and JavaScript, then it compiles into Android, iOS, and other native applications.  We thought that PhoneGap would be the perfect solution for creating an app that used HTTP APIs like a web app, while at the same time tracking user location in the background like a native app.  Unfortunately, while PhoneGap is a web app internally, it is not actually designed for use with HTTP APIs like Venmo.  We found several hacky implementations of HTTP APIs online, but none of them would work on our machines.  Therefore after approximately 24 of the 36 hackathon hours we switched to making a Ruby on Rails app so the Venmo API could be used properly.What\'s next for Cash OnlyWe see Cash Only becoming a platform like Lyft or AirBNB, where individuals can disrupt corporate monopolies and everyone gains convenience.

"The Streets","Authentic street performances","[3229, ""What makes New York City New York City is, street music/dance performances. There are numerous talented and free-spirited artists here and they don't have much communication means with their audience. We wanted to provide a platform for people who enjoy street arts and artists. How it worksWhen a user of the app sees a nice street performance, they can upload a real-time video that automatically includes the location and time. The videos can be shared with other people including tourists who want authentic street art experiences in New York City. If the dancer has a profile on the app, then you can directly make a payment to the performer. Also, you can donate to an artist after watching a video without having to be on-site of the performance. In addition, you can get future event schedules of the street dancer. If you're within 100 meters of the performance of interest, you will get a notification on your phone that you are nearby a cool performance. If you're close enough to the dancer, the app will show you how close you are to the performers with the bluetooth integration with Gimbal. Challenges I ran intoThe hardware limit was the biggest challenge in the process of development of this app. We wanted to give the user an exact number for how far is the performance, but the bluetooth integration had a limitation of detecting the distance. Accomplishments that I'm proud ofFirst of all, we incorporated 3 different apis: MasterCard api for the payment, Esri for map view and Gimbal for geo-location and geo-fencing. Out of all, our biggest accomplishment is the video view laid on top of the Esri map api in a bitmap drawable with real-time information.What I learnedThose who came here to make money will not get much out of the hackathon as opposed to those who came to make an app out of passion.

"P2Poll","A distributed voting application that uses a blockchain to prevent election tampering and voter suppression.","[4442, 'Accusations and suspicions in regards to the integrity of elections have always been an issue, but in recent years, we have seen an increasing distrust in the voting process. Several controversies surrounded the recent midterm elections, from ballot harvesting and registration fraud to voter suppression. Online voting and decentralizing elections through blockchain technologies will not only boost voter participation, but also allow for greater transparency in the voting process. ', 'The distributed application identifies unique voters using public-key cryptography, and voters use both their public and private keys to cast a vote on a referendum or poll, which propagates through the network until it becomes confirmed in a block by a miner. The blockchain allows individual voters to be anonymous, but keeps the immutable ledger of votes public in order to prevent fraud and tampering. ', 'A significant amount of time was spent brainstorming how we would implement a blockchain that would function without cryptocurrency, and shift its focus to function as a voting ledger. We eventually settled on creating the backend with Python, using Flask as a local server to display the front end user interface. Bootstrap was used for CSS theming, and JavaScript for making AJAX requests between the front and back end. ', ""One of the first problems we ran into was how to incentivize people to mine the blockchain data. While a common reward is paying cryptocurrency to the first one who successfully mines the block, we did not have a reliable, approved source to fund this operation (spending tax dollars would undoubtedly be a controversial debate). We decided on providing the opportunity to start their own polls and collect data they are interested in. A harder challenge was actually creating the decentralized blockchain network and the public ledger that would record the collected data. Accomplishments that we’re proud ofWe’re proud of the fact that we were able to create a blockchain-based distributed application in such a short time frame, considering none of us have had experience working with cryptocurrency or blockchain related applications, or peer to peer networks before for that matter. We’re also immensely proud of our idea, and its potential to make a huge difference in the world through improving the democratic process and helping prevent fraud, corruption, and voter suppression, especially for minorities and oppressed groups.What we learnedIn adapting the blockchain model for cryptocurrency to work for voting, we had to really understand the advantages and drawbacks of online transactions and a decentralized network. While there are indeed risks of outside interference from malicious hackers and other technological threats, the blockchain mitigates the problems of voter suppression and voter fraud. In addition, we learned all the technical details of implementing blockchain with Python: public key cryptography, hashing functions and mining, proof of work, immutability of blocks by dependency of previous blocks’ hashes, etc. What's next for P2PollIn the future we hope to add more security measures to the blockchain and implement two factor authentication in an effort to live up to our mission and make voting even more secure. To make it viable in the real world, the incentive for mining must also be expanded upon, so only those who accumulate enough credits will be able to run custom polls on the blockchain. Finding a way to make a more robust registration system which verifies an individual’s identity will also be a major leap in making P2Poll viable in important referendums and even elections in the future.Built WithbootstrapflaskjavascriptpythonTry it outwww.p2poll.comgithub.com      Submitted to    BostonHacks Fall 2018Winner                Best Overall Hack (1st place)              Winner                Best Domain Name from Domain.com                  Created by  Julia MaYirui RuanBartholomew C.Jeff HuiComputer engineering student with an interest in solving social problems with technologyWilliam Pine "", ' ', 'In adapting the blockchain model for cryptocurrency to work for voting, we had to really understand the advantages and drawbacks of online transactions and a decentralized network.

"", ""One of the key challenges building Easy Agile Roadmaps was ensuring that the Epics appeared at the correct place on the roadmap.

"Ambient Noise","High-quality ambient sound loops on Amazon Alexa to help you fall asleep faster, sleep better, relax, and focus.","[6197, 'A few months ago I was welcomed with a new upstairs neighbor in my apartment complex. No big deal, right? Unfortunately for me, my new neighbor had a tendency to walk very loudly and adopted a dog shortly after moving in that insisted on barking for an hour every morning at 5am. As someone who really enjoys a solid night of sleep and thinks of mornings as the bane of existence, you can probably imagine my daily frustration. After a couple weeks of unsuccessfully trying to let my body adapt to the noise, I decided it was time to put my Echo Dot on my bedside to good use... ', 'To drown out my neighbor\'s (and her dog\'s) noisy morning routine I developed a ""Rain Sounds"" Skill consisting of a 1-hour loop-able track of rainshower background noise. After using the Skill for a couple weeks with considerable success, I published it to the Alexa Skill Store and was met with unexpected rapid growth and many positive reviews. It turns out that I wasn\'t the only one who thought Alexa would be a great ambient noise device! I responded to a swarm of reviews and emails asking for more sounds, leading me to develop and publish over a dozen individual ambient noise Skills. But what about the folks who wanted to use all my sounds? To help them avoid the potential pain of (up until recently) being required to enable each Skill before you can use them and assisting in the discovery of all the available ambient noises I had to offer, I decided to build a Skill capable of playing all the sounds from one simple prompt.Enter the consolidated ""Ambient Noise"" Skill. ', 'The Ambient Noise Skill is built upon the Node.js Alexa Skills Kit Audioplayer Example for AWS Lambda as a baseline for building proper Alexa audioplayer responses and persisting user data with DynamoDB. Since most folks listen to these ambient noises while they sleep, it was vital for the Skill to never abruptly switch sounds and to be able to handle an influx of traffic during nighttime hours. To address these concerns, I modified the example project to disable the concept of a ""playlist"" in favor of looping a specified track and used AWS Lambda to run my project\'s code. Additionally, I used incrementing values in the user\'s DynamoDB record to keep track of how many times each sound has been played and when the user was last active in order to personalize the Skill\'s speech and playback behavior in the future. All in all, it\'s not a horribly complex Skill, but a lot of thought went into creating a great, reliable user experience - and when it comes to voice applications, that\'s half the battle! ', 'Although Ambient Noise is a relatively simple Skill, I ran into a particular challenge of slot-only utterances not always being recognized properly. Sometimes I would say a sound but Alexa would act like she didn\'t hear anything, and other times the result was simply inaccurate. But hey, let\'s be honest: NLP (Natural Language Processing) is hard. While I\'m sure the smart folks at Amazon are working every day to improve Alexa\'s interpretation of human speech, I needed an immediate solution. To resolve the issue, I created another intent (appropriately called ""soundOnlyIntent"") which had only one sample utterance attached to it: {Sound}. That\'s right - by isolating the utterance to its own intent Alexa was able to build a better language model. Ta-da! Problem solved! ', ""When it comes to Voice User Experiences (VUX), ensuring that your Skill can react correctly to users' requests is extremely important. Humans phrase things in a myriad of ways and natural language processing (NLP) doesn't always translate a user's speech into a perfectly-matching Skill Slot Value. To account for this, I did two things. First, I added an utterance to allow a user to get a list of supported sounds, allowing them to hear an example of what the Skill expects them to say. But more importantly, I created a function to take in a potential slot value, cast it into lowercase-only characters, then cross-check it against a list of manually-made variations based on different ways that I could envision myself talking to the Skill. The result was over 130 variations of ways to say 13 different sounds. "", ""When first making this Skill I didn't have a firm grasp of how state handling was performed in the Node.js Alexa Skills Kit Audioplayer Example. While some Skills need to keep a detailed track of a user's state to be able to resume a complex interaction if they were to leave and come back, this Skill was quite the opposite: using multiple states actually made the Skill much more complicated than it needed to be. This forced me to learn how state handling is implemented in the ASK Node.js library so that I could reliably strip down the audioplayer example project my code was built upon to only use a single state. Not only did this process result in a lean codebase for Ambient Noise, but it also gave me the knowledge to build complex stateful Alexa Skills in the future. "", ""Listening to user feedback and watching for unhandled requests from users' commands are vital to making a 5-star Skill. I'll be monitoring user feedback closely - both in reviews and via direct emails from users - to see what sounds I should add next. Additionally, I'll be using the analytics I've set up with VoiceLabs to watch for different variations of spoken names of sounds which I did not account for so I can improve the Skill's ability to play the right sound no matter what alternative name a user may have for it.

We knew we can contribute in saving lives by ensuring the fastest response of medical staff and volunteers (certified CPR/first aid volunteers)  to reach people in need. However, we soon realized that almost all of the Hajj technical problems can be solved by exploiting the shared problematic factor: data, that is associated with both space, and time: SpatioTemporal data.Initially, the team thinking was about tackling one domain, however, we questioned what if our customers are developers, architects targeting Hajj applications? Why not establish HajjTech solutions similar to what is happening with FinTech? What problems would Hajj technical solution providers face? and how can we streamline developers to provide Hajj/pilgrimage related services and technologies? Moreover, what if we provide a platform for all developers and architects to streamline the development process, and finally what if we enable them to be builders and architects?To demonstrate such a platform, we chose the medical use case ""Alert, that is alert nearby help via targeted broadcasts"", a PoC with the most impact. Saving lives by helping medical staff, especially for cardiac-arrest cases where response time is crucial. This will complement the official efforts by utilizing volunteers and spatiotemporal data in a sustainable way to reach persons in need within a target of 3 minutes.In addition, as a side effect of deploying such apps in the field, it will enable the collection of actionable data that can help in improving the notification and real-time tracking of app subjects (e.g. ambulances, scouts, volunteer doctors/nurses, certified CPR personnel).

"The Prometheus Network","Making medical information accessible to those without internet access using a SMS-based service.","[4858, ""Electronic health records are an integral part of a proper healthcare delivery model. In order to properly treat patients, doctors need to know patient's drug history, family medical history, allergies, diseases, symptoms, complication, and etc. These are just some of the many things you would find in a EHR that could potentially save your life. Contemporary EHR solutions rely on a internet connection, which is easy enough in areas with access to the internet. As of 2012 (most recent statistic we found), only one third of people have internet access, while nearly two thirds have SMS coverage. Cellular coverage is much more ubiquitous than internet coverage, so we created a way to transmit medical data in a compressed and heavily encrypted way, over SMS. This way, EHR can be available to significantly more people world wide.  "", 'Doctors (without any internet connection, only using SMS) can send a text to our number with a patient name. Their message gets redirected to Prometheus servers where the request is logged. Then the patient they are requesting data on will get a message asking them for permission for that doctor to get data about them. If they approve it, the doctor will get an encrypted text back with all of the relevant data. The doctor can then copy and paste that into a downloadable offline web app which will decrypt and uncompress the data in a more easily viewable format.The Prometheus network essentially allows advanced countries to leverage their technology to help other lesser developed countries, without having to add any hardware or any new infrastructure to those other areas.The doctor also has the capability to override the authentication process using a special code. This is only meant for absolute emergencies, and doing so automatically notifies authorities so they can dispatch local medical attention to the area. ', 'We used an AWS EC2 instance to host all of our code. We created a CGI handler page using python that we connected as a webhook to twilio. Whenever someone texts our number, it goes to the CGI page. That python script connects to multiple databases for translations between names and phone numbers, getting patient information, and getting approval for doctors to get information. ', 'None of us had ever used twilio before, so that was a learning process. It was also challenging designing the way that it asks patients for information, because the way twilio is set up is less of a chat bot and more of a message sending service. So, any information the user typed in previously has to be stored and managed ourselves. ', 'It can send and receive messages, ask for authentication, and allow the doctor to access to the patient data with proper permissions. ', 'We learned about how to send data through SMS messages and about different ways to compress medical data using special pre-defined medical codes. We also learned about encryption protocols across multiple different languages (Python and Javascript). ', 'A huge benefit the scalability of this solution. More information can be added onto the EHR and Blockchain integration will allow for an extra security measure to the server. Integration into current EHR programs would expand the functionality.

It’s aim is to make them ready to learn conventional text-based computer programming languages.In this game users will use their problem-solving skills to get the robot to the goal while learning the basics of programming. Currently the game has eleven levels, each level gets a bit more challenging and introduces the player to programing concepts such as functions, loops and conditionals. ', 'Since the idea was to create an application that will teach programming in VR and 3D, I had to figure out how to make the app usable in both case. The first approach involved creating a text IDE within the scene that would allow users to type the code, but that idea would not workout because VR users will not be able to access the keyboard that easily. So I had to think of another way to allow users to code within the scene. While doing some research I came across a block-based programing library called Blockly, this library is used for creating visual block programming languages and editors, this was perfect for my project as it would allow VR users to drag blocks around with a pointer and also allow browser users to drag blocks with a mouse, track-pad or touchscreen.The next step was to integrate Blockly with Amazon Sumerian, this was a challenge, but after a few days I managed to setup the scene with an HTML-3D entity that displays the Blockly toolbox and workspace. Next I had to figure out how to control the 3D objects in the scene using the Blocks on the HTML-3D entity this was also a challenge, but I figured out how to do it by emitting messages to the state machine each time the user drags a block to the workspace. Next I programmed an 8x8 grid that would define the path the robot has to take to get to the goal and I also designed and implemented some levels.Next I created 2 more HTML-3D entities, one to display the generated JavaScript code and the other to display information.

"Magnacle","Use the most secure password to fortify your online accounts : your voice","[5467, 'Remembering passwords is a hassle, but using a master password is even more cumbersome. Somebody gets access to that, and you’re screwed. Why not use something that only you have access to: your voice? Using Knurld’s revolutionary voice-authentication API, we help users manage their online passwords via a simple yet secure chrome extension. Say hello to the next level of security! ', ""Magnacle is a password manager for Chrome that uses's Knurld’s voice-authentication API to encrypt and store passwords on your machine. This chrome extension helps users manage their passwords by replacing all of them with the most secure password : their voice. Passwords are encrypted using 128 bit AES and saved on the user’s machine, so no information is shared with the outside world (unlike other popular password managers). The user’s voice is used to securely communicate with the server and get the key for decrypting these passwords. The key is not stored permanently on the device which makes it secured. "", 'The back-end is essentially a RESTful API written in nodeJS. The async functionality and fast I/O of nodeJS makes it perfect for our application.  The front-end website (for users to register their voice) is accessible from the chrome extension. The chrome extension (password managing) is written in JS; it records the user’s voice and forwards it to the back-end server via HTTPS, which then uses Knurld’s API to verify the person’s identity. ', 'Thanks to Knurld’s easy to use documentation, we didn’t run into any problems regarding the voice authentication part. We did,however, spend quite some time on the chrome extension (making sure that passwords are filled in not just any form, managing sessions efficiently and other minor details). ', ""The procedure to decrypt user passwords is secure end-to-end, with HTTPS for communication for the key/audio, Knurld for user verification and password encryption on the machine to secure them. Most popular password managers store encrypted passwords with themselves, which some users may not like.We, however, store the passwords on the client device only, so there isn’t any scope of compromising passwords from our end.WorkflowThe person installs Magnacle through chrome app-store.Magnacle requires the user to do an initial registration , providing username, a password and their voice.Then, the user logs into the extension using their username and password, so as to get the access token which authorizes their machine to allow voice authorization from that accountThis data is removed from the client's side and only their username and access token remains on their machine. The server contains username, password, and access-token to cross check in its database.Now whenever the user opens Chrome later on the machine in which they had logged in (ie, machine with the access token), he/she can open our extension and authenticate using their voice.If the authentication is successful, the client is given the key with which the password-data has been encrypted on their machine. In case nothing has been encrypted, Magnacle  requests a new key from the server The server then produces a random key and stored the key against the user account's record in its database. The client, then, stores the key on their machine (for that session).Magnacle works normally, that is, it provides auto-fill for websites that are already hashed in the local storage, and provides the option to do so on new websites.When the user closes Chrome or it crashes, Magnacle removes the key from the local storage. Now, the local storage once again contains username, access token and the encrypted password files.The server database contains username, master password, last valid access token (or null), last valid key, consumer-ID (for Knurld).In case the user logs out from Magnacle at any point of time, their access token and encryption key are removed, thus making the stored passwords uncrackable (as they are encrypted, and the key is note stored on the machine after this step).

"RoboVision","Assisting the visually impaired through a robotic companion (like a guide dog)","[8242, 'There is a person at our school who is unfortunately visually impaired. Usually, a person with a visual impairment would have to rely on either his own senses with a walking stick, the guidance of another individual, or the senses and guidance of a guide dog. This person in particular is allergic to dogs, so he usually has to navigate his way throughout the day with the aid of a friend or on his own with his walking stick. While brainstorming an idea, we were immediately drawn to the plight of this individual, and we decided to create something that would not only help change that particular instance of a struggling individual, but we sought to create a product that can be easily made into a small business that could be easily reproduce the product on a global scale, and completely revolutionize a rather currently cumbersome field. ', ""On the surface, our solution is simple: we have a robot that accompanies the individual,responds to environmental stimuli, and effectively communicates the presence of such obstacles to the individual who then makes a response. In addition to this, it can recognize objects around the user and tell the user what they are. The robot can be controlled with voice commands or gyroscopic control. Unlike walking sticks or guide dogs, which tell the user that an obstacle in their path exists, our project can actually recognize obstacles in the user's path, and can alert the user through audio telling him or her what stands in their path. The user, now knowing more about what is in their way, can then say a command to the robot, telling it which direction to proceed in to continue its journey. "", 'We built a simple robot in mindstorms nxt as a platform to test on, our service will work with any robot which can hold a camera, such as a drone. We built a bluetooth serial library from the ground up which runs precompiled programs on the robot to move it through serial commands. We then ran this library off of a node js server, which coordinated data gathered from the iPhone camera and allowed the user to control the robot through either voice or gesture commands. ', ""Possibly the largest challenge we ran into was optimizing the code. We had a very complex stack with more than five different languages and we wanted the user to be able to control a robot responsively through a variety of inputs, including gesture, gyroscopic control, and speech. In the end, however, by using lightweight libraries, getting rid of as much networking as possible, and writing clean code in machine-close languages, we were able to make a responsive robot with a large tech stack.Originally, our team was split in two. One group focused on the visual recognition capabilities of the robot, while another focused on using the Samsung Gear S2's gyroscopic capabilities to create a smooth control system for the robot which could be used to direct the robot in the direction of the user's walking path. The Gear S2 however, does not use Android Studio or Java to create apps, but rather an industrial grade IDE called Tizen which uses C. I had never worked with C before, and I had to pore over the API's to understand how to structure my code to access the gyroscope values. We also had to figure out how to get information from the robot's camera, to Firebase, and finally to the smartwatch which would read out the information via audio. While we were able to link information from the camera to Firebase, the development environment of the smartwatch proved to be too difficult to work with, and unfortunately we had to look to other options. Another issue we ran into was controlling the NXT through Python. The NXT robot was originally used just for concept design and prototyping, because we had originally hoped to use a drone to complete our hack. When that was not an option available to us anymore, we decided to just go ahead with the NXT. Since we were not using a normal controlller, and since we wanted to transer NXT values to Firebase, we had to create our own control system over bluetooth from the ground up using Python. We also had to custom create a control system that allowed auditory controls in which the user could give auditory commands to control the direction of the robot, which also allowed us an alternate solution to robot control once we realized the smartwatch control system may not be viable. "", 'First and foremost, as a seasoned team that has has won and mentored at many hackathons, including LA Hacks, HS Hacks I and II, Los Altos Hacks, and more, we welcomed other teams to ask us any questions they had and we were more than happy to set aside our own project when necessary and help out younger hackers. We love the hacker community, and we want to see it grow :).Our team is extremely happy with the results of our hack. We were working with systems that were extremely high level, such as OpenCV for visual recognition, gyroscopic sensors, and audio recognition for commands. Although there were aspects of this hack where we unfortunately could not get to function, we realize that this is just an** MVP (Minimum Viable Product) **which is an essential first step in creating a small business that creates a revolutionary product. Since all members of our hacking team are extremely proud and passionate of this product, we are sure to take the lessons and accomplishments from this hackathon and apply it to further refinement of our product. ', 'We were not familiar with C, which we had to use for the photon and a smartwatch app we tried to implement. We plan to implement this app in the future because we were not able to fully connect the gyroscopic control. In addition to this, we learned a lot about code optimization, and how languages like C run much faster and much closer to the machine than languages like python.We not only expanded upon our teamworking abilities, but also had the opportunity to learn a variety of coding technologies. For example, we obtained the knowledge of how to work with azure  and interpet bluetooth information aong devices in order to seize the data which wa essential to our hack. We believe that the combination of hardware and software we had to create, as well  as the extensive debugging process we ventured upon taught us how to polish our projects. ', 'In the future we plan to expand our company and product and make Robovison a global brand. We envision us expanding our product beyond the device bot we have created here to additional products such as drones to accompany individuals, and will be released at a cheap and easily produced format to revolutionize the medically impaired assistance industry. People who are unable to pay the high cost for guide dogs but do not want to sacrifice their safety or mobility will now have a viable alternative.

The quadruped, which is modeled after a canine, uses a custom genetic algorithm to learn to walk. We simulated their muscles and evaluated the dogs using a fitness formula, which determines the best dogs that should start the next generation. Each dog's purpose in life (as evaluated by the fitness score) is to walk as far as possible, with bonus points for standing up and keeping their head up high.The dogs have instincts, which are rules to speed up the evolutionary process. Their primary instinct is to move the limbs in a random sinusoid pattern, not completely sporadically. They also have an optional instinct to move left and right muscles in sync. The physicality of the dogs includes many physics based bones and joints, which are stimulated by the dog’s brain to move randomly. No premade animations were used and all walking patterns are emergent.Use-casesThere are many possible future directions to explore with machine learning. These techniques can be used to make learning robots, optimize processes, and improve self driving vehicles.Future ideasIf this project were continued, we would like to have our creatures learn to respond to variables such as seeking out food sources, avoiding obstacles, or adapting to changes in the simulated physical environment. We also had more animals planned than we had time to model but the code works for any animal, even a human or a fish. In the future, we would like to explore different gaits such as trotting or running. Motions such as sitting, standing up, and jumping may require more thorough biomechanical modeling. In the future, our models might have a flexible spine, muscles, and tendons in order to produce more lifelike simulations.

"T28 WeeFee","Americans waste $37 billion every year on unused mobile data - stop the madness and get your money back with WeeFee.","[4469, 'People spend a lot of money on mobile data that never gets put to use. Annually, a staggering $37 billion worth of mobile data gets wasted by Americans. What if you could somehow stop this wastage by renting out your unused data to others around you? Our aim is to provide this service. ', 'WeeFee allows you to broadcast a Wi-Fi signal to other devices using your mobile data plan, keeping track of the amount of data each person consumes. Using this information, the people using your data plan can get billed based on how much they use. Surely, the cost of this data is at a fraction of what phone companies would charge. This allows you to make some money from your excess mobile data while also providing internet access to others who may want it. WeeFee also maintains the privacy of users and their activity, as it is built on top of current hotspot technology. ', ""The WeeFee Android app interfaces with existing hotspot technology. We group users into two subsets - lenders and borrowers. Lenders automatically create hotspots that borrowers can recognize. In near real-time, we monitor the amount of data flowing out of connected borrowers and keep a running sum of this amount for each lender. No public API exists that lets us easily monitor network traffic or manage hotspots without root access. We got around this by delving deep into Android's source code and using Reflection to expose critical network functionality. We subsequently fed this data through an API we built running on top of a LAMP architecture hosted on AWS.Our approach is scalable, secure, and lightweight. We also built a data analytics layer so that users can monitor their activity on the application.  "", ""The main challenge we faced was how to manipulate the WiFi hardware on the device. Android is especially troublesome because different hardware manufacturers support different levels of access - the platform itself is also fragmented, which made it very difficult to initially test functionality.As we mentioned above, no public APIs exist that let us set up hotspots or easily monitor network traffic. That doesn't mean the code is totally hidden, though! We used Reflection to access private API methods, which we then leveraged to automatically turn on hotspots with pre-configured SSIDs. To get around the traffic monitoring issue, we eventually discovered a way to grab the total amount of data sent by a device since it was last booted. Via some more clever hacks, we were able to extrapolate the amount of network traffic passed through a particular device in a given time interval.Once we got past this, we had to figure out a good way to identify these SSIDs. We experimented with GPS-based identification, but eventually settled on a more simple approach wherein we prefixed SSIDs with a unique identifier.Finally, we had to come up with a performant, battery efficient mechanism for logging all of this data and choosing between potentially numerous hotspots.  "", ""We finished a working prototype that lets users borrow and lend mobile data. This is what we set out to do!We're also especially happy with our UI, which allows users to easily use the application - there's a single page, the user has to click on a button, and they're off to the races. Our data analytics page is also pretty unique. We show traffic data for each node in a dynamic graph that updates in real time. "", 'We learned a lot about low level Android programming. In particular, how to use private internal Android APIs. We also learned how to effectively handle numerous background services and set up publicly accessible APIs using AWS.

The Route Data Cloud analyzes all of the trip data and proposes new Metro routes that cover the most popular and most congested driving routes in the cityThe Roll Together mobile app also lets our users browse potential new routes for the Sao Paulo Metro and see how the construction of a particular new route could reduce their commute time as well as save them money.Following in the footsteps of successful crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo, Roll Together lets users invest in their community via a dedicated crowdfunding platform. Through the mobile app, our users can pledge money toward the construction of new Metro routes, share their pledges via social media, and see which routes their friends have pledged support for. Roll Together also includes an administrative dashboard which allows government officials and policy makers insight into both realtime and historical trip data to improve short term traffic management initiatives.The administrative dashboard also provides a summary of the proposed Metro routes and associated pledges from the Roll Together crowdfunding platform. Public transit planners can use this information to organize and demonstrate support for new construction initiatives which will have a long-term impact on the traffic situation in Sao Paulo. ', 'The Roll Together Route Data Cloud backend was implemented as a Python/Flask REST API backed by MongoDB as our database. This system keeps track of trips our users have made, and computes routes from those trips using a nearest neighbor clustering algorithm. It also exposes a REST endpoint which OpenXC-equipped vehicles can use to upload realtime trip information in a standardized JSON format. The Roll Together Crowdfunding Platform backend was implemented as a Node.JS application which talks to the Route Data Cloud, serves up the admin dashboard, and provides an API used by the mobile app. The Roll Together Mobile App was implemented using the Ionic / AngularJS mobile application framework running on top of Apache Cordova. For this prototype, we only tested and submitted an Android build, but our decision to use Cordova makes developing and releasing an iOS app is extremely easy.The Roll Together Admin Dashboard was implemented using AngularJS with Angular Material theme, integrating charting support from Chart.js.

We know that it’s hard to capture the needs of our users without experiencing the traffic situation first hand, however we believe our system addresses many of the very real pain points experienced not only by Sao Paulo, but every crowded metropolitan area.Another challenge we ran into is that our platform was designed to automatically capture GPS trip data from OpenXC-equipped Ford vehicles, however neither of us own one so we couldn’t do any end-to-end integration testing. Instead we relied on reading online documentation and using simulated data to build out our application.Accomplishments that we’re proud ofAs a small team of just two individual developers, we were very proud of our ability to create a fully featured app from scratch that addresses the short-term and long-term needs of Sao Paulo’s commuters. Not only did we give users a way to support the Metro lines they care the most about but we helped them identify which routes those were through analyzing their current driving behavior.

"SmartCab","Blockchain based Egalitarian Routing and Financing of taxi shared taxi-cab rides","[5826, 'Mobile based On Demand TaxiCabs are disrupting the transportation landscape and yet causing grief in the form or expensive ""surge"" pricing. The goal of this project was to create a more Egalitarian ecosystem that recognizes the rights of TaxiCab Drivers to a just wage; the rights of consumers to fair and transparent pricing and last but not the least provide a way for Car Manufactures like Ford to participate and thrive in a period of stagnating auto sales. ', 'The above is achieved via two orthogonal systems viz Egalitarian Routing and Blockchain based Egalitarian Finance Model.Egalitarian Routing:Here the hack focused on creating a visual interface which allows women passengers to choose other women passengers. This increases the safety of women passengers. And with more women sharing a cab the price of ride comes down. However it introduces an unusual side effect. Greedy Surge Pricing vs Egalitarian Pricing.Uber has introduced the concept of surge pricing which benefits the driver and Uber at the cost of consumers.  An Egalitarian routing system that is beneficial to passengers, comes from the pocket of the driver as he might, have to, at times drive without a passenger (Male passenger might be available but rejected in view of safety). Hence Blockchain is used to note down the “good behaviour and monetary sacrifice”. The good behaviour is then subsequently rewarded at the end of the month.Blockchain based Egalitarian Finance Model.There are 3 players in the Blockchain based Egalitarian Finance Model. Each player has different goals and different vested interest. Blockchain is used to come to a common consensus and results in win -win for all.Passengers of Taxi-Cabs:Ideally want least cost of rides with no waiting time. Safety is paramount. Ready to pay a bit more (but not much more)Taxi-Cabs: Maximize the number of people carried in least number of trips to increasing profits. Typically a cab driver has very little in the form of a credit history and lives in pay-as-you-go world. This means he pays the highest interest rate and highest rate for car repair and maintenance.Car Manufactures:Have the ability and means to get best interest rates worldwide and implement and maintain sophisticated Blockchain based solutions. Their interest lies in creating a stable eco-system that predictably consumes the cars being produced.By creating a Blockchain based Egalitarian Finance model Car Manufactures provide cheaper access to credit to Taxicab drivers (who have no credit history or balance sheet to negotiate better rates). This incentive doesn’t come free. Its provided only to those drivers that act in an Egalitarian fashion, buy Ford Cars and provide the service the consumers demand.  Consumers in return have to buy “Ford Egalitarian Pass” a Blockchain based rewards program at the beginning of every month. This stable inflow of funds is used to reward drivers and pay for the slightly increased cost of travel at normal times [Yet cheaper than surge pricing]. A part of these funds goes to Ford for bearing the associated credit risk. The travel rates can change as more information and behaviour of drivers gets recorded on the Blockchain. Passengers who use this system more can also be rewarded. By locking in Passengers and Drivers via the Blockchain based incentive scheme Ford can create a pool of taxi-cab drivers that buys only Ford Cars. ', 'Using Meteor the Front end and Egalitarian Routing was built. This can be accessed via desktop, laptop, mobile and tablets.The Blockchain part was built on IBM Bluemix Blockchain (Beta).

""Damn, that would look good on me (or my wife)"".You go home and try to look for it: ""beautiful red dress"". Google gives you 110,000,000 results in 0.54 seconds. Well that helped a lot. You think of checking the fashion websites, but the number of these e-commerce websites makes you refrain from spending more than a few hours. ""This is impossible..."". You perseverance only lasts so long - you give up. Fast forward to 2017. We\'ve got everything from Neural Forests to Adversarial Networks. You go home to look for it: Launch Dream.itYou make a chicken-sketch of the dress - you just need to get the curves right. You select the pattern on the dress, a couple of estimates about the dress. Dream.it synthesizes elegant dresses based on your sketch. It then gives you search results from different stores based on similar dresses, and an option to get on custom made. You love the internet. You love Dream.it. Its a wonderful place to make your life wonderful.Sketch and search for anything and everything from shoes and bracelets to dresses and jeans: all at your slightest whim. Dream.it lets you buy existing products or get a new one custom-made to fit you.How we built itWhat the user seesDream.it uses a website as the basic entry point into the service, which is run on a linode server. It has a chatbot interface, through which users can initially input the kind of garment they are looking for with a few details. The service gives the user examples of possible products using the Bing Search API. The voice recognition for the chatbot is created using the Bing Speech to Text API. This is classified using a multiclassifier from IBM Watson Natural Language Classifier trained on custom labelled data into the clothing / accessory category. It then opens a custom drawing board for you to sketch the contours of your clothing apparel / accessories / footwear and add color to it.

"Kids Court","No more fighting! Take your rivals to Kids Court and watch them get what they deserve. ","[5461, 'When I first observed how people interact with Alexa, I noticed most of the adult interactions are either voice commands (""add milk"") or questions/answers (""What\'s the weather?""). Kids interact with Alexa magically. They treat her as a real person captivated in a small box and love to chat with her like a friend.Once realizing that, my motivation for this contest was to create a social interaction between Alexa and a group of kids. Usually Alexa dominates the interaction and the kids respond; My approach was reverse - I wanted the kids to be able to initiate their own story and talk about what troubles them, and have Alexa be an active participant that listens and responds to them. I decided to address one of the most agonizing parts of family life - kids fighting - and created Judge Lexy which is an objective, quirky judge that helps kids settle their battles. Welcome to Kids Court. ', 'Kids Court lets kids (and their parents!) settle their arguments in a fun way, while getting a peek into how the legal system works. The prosecutor states their case, the defendant answers, the kids can call witnesses and present evidence and finally Honorable Judge Lexy rules with funny dare-style verdicts that the losing side must execute. While kids probably mostly enjoy the revenge aspect, in the process they learn about the roles of a defendant, prosecutor, evidence, witnesses and more. They also learn to stand up for themselves in a calm manner, to articulate their problems coherently, and to take responsibility for their actions. Kids Court is intended for kids age 8 and up. Younger children can enjoy it too if someone explains the legal vocabulary.  ', ""I designed an algorithm that helps Judge Lexy determine if the defendant was guilty or not. I crafted a user experience that covers many use cases and is meant to be fun and engaging for the kids even if Judge Lexy rules against them.I also added a few easter eggs to surprise the kids, and put in explanations of some basic legal terms that the kids can ask about when they're unsure (i.e what's a prosecutor?). Technically, as I wanted to focus on content and user experience, I used thestoryline.io to build the entire skill. There are dozens of different logical paths and various possible responses for Lexy to make her character more engaging and the overall experience more entertaining. "", ""My motivation was to create an experience where Alexa is a social facilitator for a group of 2-4 participants. The skill has to let them talk freely and make them feel like Lexy is listening and responding to everyone. As every teacher/parent can probably attest, it was very challenging to create a natural yet structured conversation that keeps the kids in control, lets everyone feel heard, and teaches them something in the process.A major challenge was that Alexa doesn't pick up some of the things the kids say as either they talk too fast, get excited and step out of the flow, or can't help themselves and talk together. I tried to go around this by expanding the possible utterances for each state and creating default responses for almost everything they might say.   "", ""Kids and parents alike seem to really enjoy this skill. I tested it on a small focus group and it was beautiful to see how responsive the kids were, how naturally they engaged in the conversation and how much they enjoyed having Lexy listen to them. They interacted with the skill for a couple hours (!) and I'm really satisfied with how they believed Lexy was real and the pleasure they took in challenging her with many different cases. The best feedback was seeing their hilarious reactions whenever Lexy ruled. I was very pleased at how engaged the kids became even though there were no screens or any visual images involved. "", 'I learned how to design for voice and I learned a lot about how to design for kids. The idea I originally had changed tremendously once I tested it on real kids. Personally, this was the first product I ever built entirely on my own and not as part of a team. I had to deal with many issues that were new to me, such as voice design, use of ssml, technical jargon, finding and fixing vicious bugs that made the skill crash, legal aspects, sound effects, making a video and more. This was a super fascinating experience on many levels.  ', ""I plan to make Lexy smarter by implementing more investigation flows and a broader range of verdicts.Educationally, I'd like to take this game to the next level and introduce more concepts from the legal system such as an alibi, an objection, and more. I currently chose not to store any information about the users to make sure I comply with COPPA. I plan to look into it further and see how/if I can create a more personalized experience and create more value for returning players.Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy it!

The whole process can psychologically and physically drain a person honestly.Asides the stress and time wasting, there is so much monetary budget going into electoral processes. Recently, there were talks of allocating over a hundred billion naira just for the upcoming elections so as to provide ballot boxes and some other miscellaneous. So, when the hackathon process started, coming up with a solution that could positively impact my nation was not really difficult.Basically, all the expenses, the violence, the stress, the election rigging, the apathy exhibited by the citizens can be cut off to a maximum extent if the nation can introduce an online election system for her citizens.

"FC + BlinkCeption","Facial gesture enabled web control using computer vision","[5114, 'What starts with weakness in limbs soon progresses to muscle degeneration, which can rob a person’s ability to walk or use one’s arms. As of 2015, this is the harsh life of over 200,000 ALS patients. Similar conditions affect the day to day functioning of numerous physically disabled people around the world. We wished to try and lessen their difficulties. The first idea we thought of was to make their web experience  as seamless as possible. Since the nerve degeneration starts from below the neck, we thought of using Computer Vision to allow users to navigate websites completely hands-free using just their facial movements as captured by their webcams. ', 'Our project is a python program which enables users to interact with websites using just their facial movements such as eye blinks, eyebrow raises, and mouth opens. By using these movements, they can interact with buttons, dropdowns, slideshows, text fields and other web elements. Users are able to type text using a set pattern of facial gestures. These patterns are mapped to morse code and the output is shown in the form of text.Additionally, our program employs facial recognition to remember previous users and is able to run using the pre-saved ratios of their facial features. This means that our software can be used by multiple users. Finally, we allow the users to send emergency Emails and WeChat messages. Once the webcam detects no facial patterns for 10 seconds, an emergency message is broadcasted to all their preferred contacts. This is especially useful if people with disabilities happen to face an accident. ', 'Facial RecognitionWe use an existing library for implementing facial recognition of the user. This is used to verify and use pre saved thresholds unique to each user. For the blink, eyebrow raise and mouth open detection, we use a pre trained model that takes in a video frame and returns a list of 68 (x,y) coordinates of the facial landmarks detected. We then perform computations on this data to get the respective thresholds.Morse Code DecipherThe typing process consists of registering a blink as a dot and an eyebrow raise as a dash. Once the user is satisfied with the current pattern typed, they can open their mouth to enter the string into our decipher function.

And then other viewers would jump in on the pot saying they will add $3 per kill, and so on, and the streamer would accept the mission and put up notepad on OBS overlay and manually count their kills. Viewers who joined mid stream would not know what was going on. So we wanted to make an extension that not only helps organize this more visually.

', 'LeARn allows users to interact with physics simulations, plot 3D graphs, view MRIs, and watch the molecular structure of a chemical compound float before their very eyes. The user can move and manipulate these projections via an online client, affecting factors like scale, rotation, and position.

', 'LeARn was very difficult to build for a variety of reasons. Nobody on our team had worked in Unity before or even knew C#, so to call it a learning experience is an understatement. We used complex and highly detailed models, and optimising these such that they would render well on mobile presented a significant challenge in and of itself.

"ORB","A fun, arcade game that emphasizes fast-paced, mental arithmetic.","[5539, ""I was inspired by the lack of mathematics-based games that were fun. Before developing this game, I'd browsed the App Store for educational games that weren't only adding and multiplying problems with a fancy GUI, but games that could engage an audience.  "", ""Dash through colorful levels and bounce off numbered walls in ORB. Exercise strategy and fast mental arithmetic skills to progress and continuously beat levels to increase your high streak. Intuitively tilt your device to guide the ORB through the infinite amount of levels. Don't fly off the field, get caught in obstacles, or miss the goal! As part of the difficulty curve, the game gets harder as time goes by - slowly moving into new obstacles and adding multiplication, division, and subtraction obstacles over long periods of time. To try to engage a younger audience, I made the game start with simple addition. Of course, to keep the game entertaining, the task of controlling the ball - which, in itself, develops visual motor co-ordination skills - still makes the game addicting.   "", ""ORB was made using the Unity3D engine along with its C# libraries, and some custom Java frameworks I've made and exported to DLLs with IKVMC. As I'm familiar with Java, most of the statistics controllers and background game management controls were made in Java. However, to deal with input and GUI, I used Unity's built-in libraries. Personally, art is not my forte, hence the minimalistic and colorful design of the game. Still, I decided to go with Cinema4D to mock-up and make the 3D models for the cubes of various sizes. "", ""ORB was not my first app, but it was my first game and the first experience that I have really had using the Unity3D game engine. Nevertheless, I had some challenges in creating the algorithm and figuring out specific gameplay elements. In terms of gameplay, I had designed the game with Darts in mind. This game, which you have probably heard of, involves the player throwing a set of arrows, called 'darts,' onto a board. Certain areas are larger, and others are smaller. I decided to take inspiration from this game and create the numbered walls of different sizes so, for example, the wall which increases your score to 5, will be smaller, and thus harder to get to. Algorithm-wise, this was hard for me to create. The levels are all 'procedurally,' generated which calculates the difficulty that a level should be (by the score but the hidden time it takes to complete past levels); it's almost like a piecewise function which operates as either an exponential, logarithmic, or sigmoidal function. However, with the difficulty being calculated and with different walls put together, they wouldn't fit together like bricks. "", ""Overall, I’m proud of completing and creating my first 3D game. The entire experience of creating ORB was extremely enjoyable and was a really good project to begin and get used to the Unity3D workflow. I am really proud of this fact and I believe that I am now familiar with this workflow and can execute upon what was before, just a game idea, in multiple platforms. Additionally, I am pleased with being able to answer questions actively on the Unity3D forums and IRC channels. I'm also proud of getting a Twitch live streamer, GameDevCompany, to test out ORB on stream in front of an audience of about seventy people. "", 'I’ve learned a lot through simply experimenting and reading through Unity’s documentation. Generally speaking, I learned a lot about the development of gameplay mechanics and how to actually execute them using Unity, C#, and Java. The use of Java in itself was a completely new learning experience I’ve known Java for five years now, but I am completely new to the fact that you can convert Java source code and use IKVMC to convert it into a DLL, and make it run like a fully fledged library in Unity. Additionally, through ORB, I learned concepts of the functional programming paradigm, a particular type of declarative programming which focuses on using short, maintainable statements like algebraic expressions or functions. I used Java’s lambdas and C#’s LINQ to exercise some fundamental functional concepts (that are part of these mainly OOP languages), and also utilized the ideas of filters, sinks, and maps. ', ""The next release of ORB will involve an easier level system and also a store, which has already been completed. The store has all sorts of add-ons, such as the function of shapeshifting so the ORB can fit through crevices in between rocks. To purchase items in this store, there is a collection system and a streak system. Once you've tested it, you'll realise that I obviously plan to make the game easier - the difficulty curve is not perfect as yet!The latest build of the game (when uploaded to the App Store), will also have a checkpoint/milestone system. If you pass a streak of five (or any other multiple of five), you will always start at that checkpoint.

"ExplORer Surgical","Workflow management tool for the operating room that enhances communication, awareness, &amp; efficiency and reduces cost","[7071, 'Two surgeons performing the same operation at a given hospital will most certainly have individual preferences that differ based on technical operative steps, instruments, equipment and medications required for the case. If surgical staffing and human resource constraints were smaller and less complex, consistent teams could be formed, and any problems arising from this variability would be alleviated via team experience and subsequent familiarity. However, consistent teams are simply impractical, particularly at large academic and community hospitals. Although nurses are very well-trained and experienced, the the preferences of individual surgeons are very difficult to keep track of in the absence of a comprehensive and interactive technological solution.Delays and disruptions due to missing instruments and supplies are commonplace in surgery, and this is directly related to the lack of a clear and up-to-date guide to a given surgeon’s preferences. ExplORer was built to solve this problem, one which our clinician co-founder, Dr. Alex Langerman (an ENT surgeon and leading OR efficiency researcher), faced every day in his own operating room. Additionally, when the surgical case needs are unknown, the tendency is to open more instruments and equipment in an effort to provide for any possible needs. This is an inefficient strategy that leads to longer setup times and a substantial amount of waste (anything opened in the operating room needs to be discarded or resterilized); what’s even is the “open everything” strategy still does not guarantee that the needed supplies will be among the mass of materials that were opened. This misalignment of surgeon and case needs and staff activity is a pain point for both surgeons and nurses, and ExplORer directly addresses these overlapping team needs.Furthermore, by more accurately aligning surgeon preferences with operating room setup, we save hospitals money by decreasing OR time per case and preventing wasted supplies. More accurate setup and decreased delays can also lead to greater OR throughput, which may increase revenue for hospitals with high surgical demand.Surgeons’ preferences and what tools and supplies are used in which step of which cases is a treasure trove of data that can be leveraged for hospital clients as well as surgical device manufacturers and purchasing organizations. Knowing how surgeons perform procedures (which step in which order) has potential public health and surgical education applications. Additionally, the very act of using ExplORer during surgical cases generates granular data on procedure progress that can be used to streamline OR management and can fuel predictive analytics on surgical activity (e.g., anticipating when a surgical case will end so next steps can be planned). Currently, there is no commonly-used technology to capture this intraoperative data. ', ""ExplORer, a web-based, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) workflow management application, is an interactive surgical playbook that promotes optimal teamwork in the operating room. Best practices are built into a customized workflow for each case. Step-by-step instructions and diagrams help surgical team members follow along with the case and prepare for what's coming next; in doing so, we help deter delays and disruptions that can occur from missing or incorrect tools. We also aim to reduce the waste of disposable tools that are opened but go unused – a major component of the billions of dollars of surgical supply waste that occurs annually in the United States. Additionally, variability in cost has a negative impact on patient outcomes. The analytics component of our software allows hospital administrators to track surgical activities and costs to better manage their ORs and gain new insights for operational efficiency. "", 'ExplORer was built with MEAN stack (Angular.js, Express.js, Node.js, and Mongo DB), using Socket.io. The application is hosted on AWS with multiple EC2 application servers running Ubuntu OS. We also use HAProxy load balancers. ', 'We needed to have instantaneous synchronization of information between multiple team members in the Operating Room with separate browser sessions. We solved it with the use of WebSockets. ', ""We have built three generations of our program and currently have a commercial version of our software. Our preliminary pilot results show that with the use of ExplORer versus the baseline, setup time was reduced by 10%, tool-related disruptions were reduced by 42%, and cost of the case due to wasted items was reduced by 5%.  These results can be directly linked to team satisfaction and reduction in operating room time. These results suggest millions of dollars in annual savings potential, not just for large academic and community hospitals but even for smaller hospitals, simply by using our product. The potential for cost savings is heightened even further once we receive our next round of funding and are able to build out an aggregate data analytics dashboard for stakeholders to view the granular data that ExplORer collects during live surgical cases. As we prepare to make our first sales into hospitals, this dashboard delivers an integral aspect of ExplORer’s key value propositions.We have received several awards. We won $50,000 through the Pritzker Group Venture Fellows Program, were awarded 2nd place at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business’ New Venture Challenge, named one of four finalists in the Cleveland Clinic Innovations’ New Ventures Healthcare Challenge, and named one of the 150 Nominees for Chicago Inno's 50 on Fire competition.We have been funded by a Phase 1 and Phase 1B Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) grant from the National Science Foundation.

"Pinage","Leave Your Message, Lead Your Life","[6022, ""Let me tell you a simple story. Sometimes I leave notes for my family member at home or for my colleagues at my workplace, especially when they are not reachable. One day I leave an important document at my desk and leave a note for my colleague. But for an unknown reason my colleague does not get the notes, as a result he could not able to complete the task. I think almost all of us sometimes face this type of problem. From this incident, I and my team think that why we cannot make this an automatic process. i.e. we leave a message in a particular location and when someone enter that area that message will automatically popup. From that point of view, we come up with an idea Pinage, a simple location aware message service.How Pinage worksPeople sometime cannot reach their friends colleagues or someone to whom they want to notify something. Pinage is the simplest location based message tagging service to notify their contacts. Using Pinage you can just simply leave your message in a particular location for your friends or contacts. When your desired person enter that area the tagged message will automatically popped up. As a result, no one will ever miss your notes. In Pinage the message will store in the server for one day only, after that this message will be automatically deleted from the server.How we built itAt first we finalize our full project features and the needed tools and APIs. At the very beginning of the development process we focused on the simplest UX and UI design of Pinage. We used Google Design Sprint method to design the UX and UI of Pinage. During the UX design we design a couple of mockups. After finalizing the the UX we develop the server end of our app. We developed the server end by PHP and the mysql database to provide the service to the client app using Rest API.In Pinage client side is an native android application which is built with the ALOHAR location API. We developed the location aware messaging service in such a way that user can get the tagged message immediately after enter the specific area. We used the ALOHAR location service effectively and thus we successfully minimize the battery usage of device to detect the Geofencing event. We used the some external library such as android volley library for Rest API communication with the server. We also used other third party library in UI design of our app.Challenges we ran intoAt first when we started the Pinage development process, our main focus was to design the simplest UX. The UX design takes a lot of time to start our app development. Finally after a couple of mockups, we design the UX of Pinage application in such a way that user can easily put their message using just single tap. Now user can just type theirs message, select contact and a single tap will tagged in the user current location for their desired one.After that we faced a lot of problem in detection of user arrival or departure event with minimal usage of device battery. At first we did not read the ALOHAR documentation properly. But when carefully and thoroughly read and inspect the ALOHAR developer document, we saw that how easily we can detect any Geofencing event. After developing the Pinage the second most hurdle we faced during the app testing time, as we have to tag a message in a location and we have to wait until the ALHOR fires either arrival or departure event.Accomplishments that we are proud ofWe are tried how simply user can leave a message in a particular location and receiver can get the message as quickly as possible when the receiver enter a particular area. The main hardle was how to detect a Geofencing event, i.e. how we can determine when a user enters a place/area or leave that place. We successfully implement that feature with the help of ALOHAR location API. But the integration was not so smooth. We have to test that location based message popping feature several times to finalize that feature. But finally we successfully integrate this feature with the Pinage.We also design the UX of Pinage in such a way that user can simply pin a message without performing many unnecessary steps. In Pinage user can simply pin a message. Also receiver does not need to open the app to check whether there is any message; Pinage will automatically notify an user if there is a message for him/her.What we learnedOur team developed many locations aware application in which we try to provide some information when an user enter an area. But the main problem in those apps was, we have to periodically check whether user is in proximity of a particular location. This process drains the device battery a lot. In Pinage we used the ALOHAR with our wrapper library to reduce the battery drain in determination of any Geofencing event.What's next for PinageDuring this limited time we mainly implement the necessary features. But we have planned to add new features to smooth the user experience of Pinage. For example,  till now the message lifetime of Pinage in server is one day, but we have a plan to extend this so that user can have multiple option for the message lifetime such as one hour[for short message], one week[for long lasting message] or message with lifetime validity. We are also thinking to add message conversation for a particular topic in private or public mode.  We will also add the social network like facebook, google+ for signin or to allow user to  import their contact or share their public message.Built Withalohar-mobileandroidandroid-studiomysqlphp5Try it outplay.google.com      Submitted to    Create Context-Aware Applications with Alohar Mobile's SDK    Created by  I am the team leader of this project.

"Project Julius","Seizure Prevention Software","[6055, 'In 1997, an episode of Pokemon aired in 4.6 million homes in Japan. This episode had a scene with many quick flashes that caused 685 children to be hospitalized for photosensitive epileptic seizures.In 2008 an online community known as 4chan posted seizure-triggering images and videos on epilepsy related forums and websites.In 2012 a promotional video for the London Summer Olympics was reported to trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy.The threat posed to those with epilepsy in each of these incidences could have been significantly mitigated with software that detects when potentially hazardous elements are present on a screen, and blocks them.  This is what Project Julius does.The name comes from Julius Caesar, the roman emperor. Julius Caesar was an innovative leader who has been post-diagnosed with epilepsy. We aim to innovate the seizure prevention measures in place for video on computers.How it worksProject Julius monitors what is displayed on the computer\'s monitor and blocks quick image changes in order to prevent seizure triggers.Using CamTwist and OpenCV to capture the images on screen.  We then process them using a histogram analysis in broken-down regions of the screen to look for quick changes.  If high-frequency flashing is detected, a window is pushed above all other open windows, warning the user and covering the threat.In order to analyze the display to figure out if there are flashes that we should block, we perform a histogram analysis on the image. First, we take 2 consecutive frames and then divide them into a 10 by 10 grid of pixel regions. We then analyze the colour spectrum and create a histogram representing each region. Then, we evaluate the integral of the Hellinger Distance to find the Bhattacharyya Coefficient. This distance quantifies the similarities between the regions and allows to easily see major changes in the image such as a flash. If there is a 95% change in the image, determined with the Bhattacharyya Coefficient, then we declare it to be a ""flash event"". We then compare this result to the previous 10 results for each regions, if 60% of the frames contain ""flash events"" then the seizing guard is triggered and the window is minimized. We analyze  the display at 30fps, and require of 60% of the last 10 frames to contain dangerous flash events to declare a possible triggering event. This makes Project Julius able to catch possible seizure triggering events after only 0.2 seconds.Challenges we ran intoThe first challenge we ran into was being able to complete the capture, analysis, and blocking in real-time with zero lag.  We altered our algorithm and refactored most of our existing python code, ultimately accomplishing precise analysis with minimum resource consumption.The biggest challenge we ran into was being able to accurately detect when an image was flashing repeatedly, rather than an object moving or a scene changing. A lot of things seem like they could be flashes at first, but are clearly not when watched by a human. By comparing multiple frames one after another we were able to better analyze what is happening on the display.Accomplishments that we are proud ofOur proudest accomplishment is learning about epilepsy.  In order to understand the requirements of our project we had to learn a few things about epilepsy including triggers, effects, and number of people affected. However, we wanted to go further. Since one of our team members has had family experience with epilepsy we decided to learn more. We learned about multiple different kinds of epilepsy, triggers for different kinds, statistics, long-term effects, symptoms, and the demographic of affected persons. In our opinion, the coding may have taught us new ways to accomplish our tasks, but we think the knowledge we know have will have a greater impact on our lives. Epilepsy is something we have have to deal with first hand in our life be it friends, family, or anyone in public.What we learnedDuring the creation of Project Julius we learned a lot about Epilepsy and its causes. Using online resources we discovered how many people it affects, common triggers, long-term effects, and large incidents in public.We also learned a lot about how to process large images (upwards of 1080p) quickly and effectively using histograms of regions on the screen. The changes in the histogram values indicate a change in content, a large difference indicates a flash or scene change. We then had to further our analysis to compare multiple changes to detect the rate at which the image changes, and thus determine if we should block it.Our initial approach to capturing the screen was to use the low-level frame buffer built into Linux. We spent a few hours learning how to access and process the frame buffer but ended up deciding not to go with it. We felt that using something built into Linux would greatly decrease our potential reach so we changed our screen capturing method to be more portable and cross-platform by using OpenCV and native desktop capturing applications that can pipe into Python. We found multiple programs for the different operating systems such as CamTwist and ManyCam.What\'s next for Project JuliusProject Julius is in a state such that it can be applied in many situations, however it isn\'t ready to be released fully. We hope to continue development and create a fully refined and deployable application.

"StockAssist","Helping you invest.","[6834, 'Humans will invest in stocks they believe in and sell stocks they don’t believe in; it only makes sense to be logical when dealing with matters of money and finance. Thus, accurately predicting stock changes requires knowing which companies are currently trending in the public’s favor. What StockAssist brings to the table that is unique to our generation is generating predictions based on social media trends. Older generations may look to news sources to inform them of which stocks to invest in, but this implies a lag of possibly weeks as news sources need to gather their data and edit it before publishing. By the time the news reaches the crowd, its advice may already be outdated. With StockAssist, we cut out this lag entirely and give you the real-time general consensus of how a company stands by data mining and implementing machine learning on social media posts. This will give the most accurate prediction of how stocks will fare, and thus is revolutionary in advising people with their stock investment decisions.  ', 'This web application will take the stock in question and collect all the news, social media, and statistical data about that stock. It will then run this data through our machine learning algorithms to analyze how well the company is doing in the eyes of the public. With this application, the users will only need to check one place to find an aggregated analysis of their stocks from a diverse, real-time generated data set.  ', 'The first iteration of the application was written in Go. After discovering incompatibility issues with the Azure platform, the application was completely rewritten in javascript using Node.js. The application consists of two main parts the server and client, with each communicating with another through http requests.The server is where all of the heavy data manipulation is conducted. The server receives a query from the client via an HTTP GET request. The server then takes that query and using Twitter’s REST search api finds 1000 tweets that match that query. Then using regular expressions, the server strips and removes all the referenced URLs (in order to make the semantic analysis easier). After the data has been prepared, we perform an analysis of the tweets using semantic analysis tools hosted on Azure. The analysis tool then returns a score based the words used, and from that we generate a confidence statistic.The second part of the application consists of the client. As mentioned beforehand, the client sends a query to the server, and the server in turn returns a summary of the analysis it performed. The client then generates a stock recommendation based on a determining algorithm, displays a rough summary of that data using a pie chart, and gives a confidence statistic. The client was written in the standard HTML5/CSS/JavaScript while reference several other open source libraries for the visuals and the communications.      ', ""Developing a web application hosted on Microsoft Azure was our biggest challenge. Initially, our team used Go to develop the back-end of the application; however, Azure never seemed to be compatible with Go. Thus, we had to switch languages, and completely re-write the entire back-end in Node.js. Another challenge we faced along the lines of Microsoft Azure was figuring out the Machine Learning. It was difficult to create training models with the help of different statistics such as chi-squared. We attempted to create an optimal training model on twitter feeds based on binary sentiment analysis. Upon building the training models, it was another challenge to create a predictive experiment based on the optimized training model, and hosting the solution on the web. Although we couldn't get the machine learning algorithm to work, we made great headway in learning this sector of Microsoft Azure. AccomplishmentsDespite all the challenges present, we were able to finally implement Microsoft Azure as a web host for our application. Even though we did not completely figure out the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, we made great progress in learning how to utilize this tool to perform sentiment analysis on twitter feeds. In order to actually create the machine learning, we used a direct approach with sentiment analysis through node.js. On the front-end, we were able to coordinate all the back-end to co-exist with the front-end. The most important accomplishment was to develop the Azure hosting service, along with our web application.What I learnedThis hackathon was full of twists and turns and we definitely learned a lot from it. From how to use Azure to what web frameworks work best with our front end, our general takeaway for this hackathon was to remember to reach out for help. The Microsoft team was immensely effective in mentoring us and helping guide us to reach our goals; it’s been a game changer for us and it’s something we’ll be sure to do in future hackathons. What's next for STOCKASSISTWe’d love to expand on every aspect of our app. This means we’d love to include more and more social media outlets to better refine our data set, and thus use this to refine our machine learning algorithm as well.

The same approach applies to the Infrastructure solution.The solution supports multi-tenancy and we safely store the data to enrich the tickets (e.g. classify the object like the user, device or data of the c-level management).To elaborate on that, we gather information about security from the following sources:Graph API - Security AlertsSecure ScoreSecure Score Control Profiles (for recommendations on raising secure score)Graph API - Sign-InRetrieving the last sign-ins of a user to determine if authentication was with MFA enforced. If so automatically closing the security alert.Graph API - Directory AuditMonitor users for strange behavior, especially on sign-ins from an unfamiliar location.Next to the Graph API we also get information through Azure Resource REST API to gather: All Azure ResourcesWe get notified on resources that are not monitored by our SOC and therefore are a possible threat for breaches.

"Holdup","Send Gamified Messages to Your Friends!","[3896, 'Fun new ways to communicate with friends are growing in popularity, and we wanted to build a communication tool of our own. We took inspiration from the ""money maze"" toy, which locks a gift in a transparent cube maze. In order to unlock the cube and get the gift inside, the recipient must complete a complex puzzle. ', ""Holdup is an iMessage app that allows users to send secret messages and payments. The catch is that in order to read the message and accept the payment, the recipient must complete a challenging mini-game. The game uses the device's accelerometer, and is intended to frustrate users who want to read the message or receive their money. Senders can choose from three difficulty levels, and a unique game level is automatically generated. The communication is built directly into the iMessage platform, which allows users to send the mini-game to their friends, even if they don't have the app installed. "", 'The app is written in Swift and built with Xcode. It exists almost exclusively as an iMessage extension. The mini-game uses SpriteKit, a 2D game engine, to render sprites, simulate physics, and detect collisions. ', ""The iMessage platform has a lot of restrictions, many of which are undocumented. Because the app exists as an extension inside the Messages app, many normal app capabilities are unavailable. We ran into a dozen of such issues, and adapted the design of the app to fit into the given constraints. Although our final result had to undergo many unforeseen design revisions, we're happy that we were able to create a working and fun application. "", ""We're especially proud of our ability to iterate quickly. Our app design and vision experienced three major overhauls over the course of the weekend, and experienced many minor tweaks and adjustments. Some of these changes were prompted by an analysis of the app and consideration of how well it aligned with the user's goals. One quick example: We originally envisioned the ability to create custom mini-game levels via a drag-and-drop level builder. We thought that the sender would enjoy creating a custom experience for their friend, so they could be as nice or mean as they desired. As we considered the concept and talked with others, we discovered that the sender would rather be able to create a challenging mini-game quickly and generally finds more value in their recipient's reaction than the implementation of the actual game level. Since we structured the app well, we were able to react to these changes and make a better end product as a result. "", 'We learned a bunch about the Message extension iOS framework, but more generally learned about technical risk. When we committed to creating an iMessage app, we reaped many benefits, but also inherited some challenges. Because the technology and user experience are so tightly coupled, we had to make some tradeoffs that affected the end users. However, the additional constraints imposed by the framework forced us to ask tough questions and refine our idea more than we otherwise would have.

"Fonts Done Right","Font retrieval, generation, and manipulation","[6116, ' ', 'We aim to provide a toolkit for typographers to get the font right. We try to solve the above four challenges as follows in a ""deep learning mindset"":Hard to find existing fonts: nearest-neighbor retrieval in the latent space! Select two existing fonts, get the embedding of them, and you can retrieve an existing font with the taste of both.License issues: generate fonts with trouble-free data! We compiled a dataset of Google Fonts with the SIL Open Font License which ""permits the fonts to be used, modified, and distributed freely"" with ~2K fonts ~120K characters. We aim to learn a greater font manifold with the ""base fonts"" free of license issues.Font design is time-consuming: have fun searching for new fonts in the latent space! With latent vector arithmetics, you can achieve a style like ""get a bold Times font using a normal Times font and the bold-ness of Bold Helvetica without the Helvetica-ness"".Raster font images are not deployable: generate TTF vector files! With the generated raster image, you can train a model to trace the boundaries and obtain the vector font files (integration to the interface pending).Font generation is a field with huge potentials. A deployable font generation toolkit can change the entire workflow of a typographer and therefore reshape the design industry. ', 'We build all our models in PyTorch.Font retrieval model: we used the pre-trained model provided by [FIXME: add link] to retrieve fonts in the Google Fonts dataset.Raster font generation:1) Variational Autoencoder: we implemented our own autoencoder to learn the latent space of different characters and fonts.2) StarGAN: we modified the code of [FIXME: add link] to manipulate different attributes of a character, such as bold-ness and serif-ness.Vector font generation: we tried to reproduce the model proposed by A Learned Representation for Scalable Vector Graphics, implementing it from scratch. We first train a variational autoencoder on raster images and use gated recurrent units and a mixture density network to generate SVG commands and obtain vector font files. ', 'Attributes of a character can be hard to learn. For example, we tried to learn the serif-ness of a character with StarGAN, but it does not produce comparable results with simple latent space interpolation with VAE.The representation of a vector file is vastly different from that of an image. Even if we could get a correct base VAE model to generate raster images, the recurrent units to produce command tokens and numbers are hard to train and we could not get a reasonable result.Hooking up the back-end models with the front-end UI needs a lot of communication and engineering. ', 'Font retrieval modelCompiling the Google Fonts datasetInterpolation between two fontsManipulating the attributes of a fontGenerating SVG fonts ', 'In addition to providing a toolkit, this project provides a method overview for the task of Font Generation. We have a few observations during the development:Start from simple fonts. We observe that simple fonts such as sans serif are easier to generate and manipulate than highly stylized ones such as handwriting. However, in the typography market, these simple fonts are on the highest demand. Therefore instead of focusing on generating fonts with crazy styles, we can work on producing production-grade simple fonts that improve readability.Data is crucial. A utopian vision is to learn the font manifold and produce open-source industrial-grade fonts to everyone. However, to learn this model, it is always good to get more data, especially for the highly stylized fonts. With more typographers contributing to open-source fonts, we can achieve this goal earlier.Vector paths is a visual representation worth looking into. This is not only important for the task for Font Generation, but for a resolution-independent representation for computer vision in general, such as image segmentation, data annotation, and art creation. ', 'A better interface and clear functionalities. To make the interface friendly to the general public, we need to restructure the UI and list the functionalities more clearly.Get more data. Currently, we have the entire dataset of Google Fonts, but we need to get more data with valid licenses.Investigate the representation of vector paths.

Inadequate training and information has been  hindering the implementation of the new curriculum, as most teachers teachers have said. There has been criticism that  the Government has been focusing  on training only teachers employed by the Teachers Service Commission (TSC).The truth is that given the huge number of learners, most teachers in lower primary are employed by parents. This locks them out yet they are the ones to teach the new system. There has been much emphasis on digital learning yet there has been no adequate equipment to deliver  it. Taking an example as a teacher You teach for 10 minutes and you are told to play a video but you realize you have no decoder and or even the video itself. On the other hand In the private sector, school managers are forced to pay Sh7,000 per teacher for the training. They also buy books. The postponement of the new curriculum, means to financial losses. However there is a gap that Hamaisha platform comes in, according to the Deputy President William Ruto more than 700,000 Class One pupils out of 1.2 million have received tablet computers under the digital literacy programme. Inaddition to that , Jomo Kenyatta University of Science and Technology (JKUAT) had partnered with Kenya Private School Association (Kepsa) to ensure private institutions also benefit from the laptops project.The deal with JKUAT will see the university manufacture about four million devices for the next three years at a fixed price of Sh15, 000 per device.The devices will be distributed to over 11,000 private schools throughout the country and are expected to benefit over 1.8 million pupils.Irregardless of this tablets and laptops, there has not been a clear way to inculcate learning materials of the new curriculum into the tablets and laptops. Also there has been no proper, easier and cheaper way to train the teachers and also incorporate parents in implementing the new curriculum. Hamaisha is a swahili name meaning derived from the word Kuhamaisha meaning inspire with a goal to help solve these problems through a digital platform.

"Magnetic Fish Spectacular!","bigger, crazier, electronic version of an old childhood game","[6179, 'Was going toy shopping, as one does, when I walked by this old childhood game. A feeling of nostalgia swept over me as I remembered catching the little fishes with the tiny rod that is more fit for hamsters than humans. Suddenly I imagined what if this were more adult sized, how funny would that be? Now here we are, making it happen. Or at least trying to :) ', ""It's a wooden platform with holes containing fish inside that spins around inside a kid swimming pool via a motor. The fish have RFID cards inside with magnets. The rods use magnets to catch the fish. Each rod will have the ability to detect which fish was caught and how many points it was worth. "", 'THE FISH6 total that sit inside the holes of the wooden platform.Each fish was made out of 2 mixing bowls. One slightly bigger than the other, so that the top half bowl can swivel over the bottom bowl when the fish opens and closes its mouth. The top bowl is connected to the bottom with a wooden dowel and twisty ties. The top fin is made out of hard foam we found at AxMan. The hard foam fin was screwed in to the top half bowl and the googly eyes were glued on using E6000. We gave each fish a unique look with a sharpie marker and googly eyes. Inside the bottom bowl of the fish, we sanded the surface down and then used E6000 to attach two ceramic magnets, followed by an RFID card, and topped with another two ceramic magnets. The only piece inside the fish that is glued down is the first magnet since we wanted people to be able to easily remove the fish from the rod once caught.THE SMART FISHING RODThe tip of the rod contains an RFID sensor with two magnets in the middle (taped together) and that is wired all the way up the line and down the rod that will connect to the teensy inside the box located near the base of the rod. This wire is secured with zip ties along the way.The tip of the rod has the top half of a 3 inch diameter plastic Easter egg to hide the RFID sensor and was meant resemble the cartoonish design of the tiny rods from the original game. A positive side effect of this is that it makes the game a little more challenging because you have to angle the rod and have it timed just right in order to catch the fish.The fishing line is made out of colorful paracord that has its ends singed off with fire.Each rod is created using a wooden dowel attached to a foam sword handle.Towards the base of the rod will be a container holding all the circuitry and components of the smart fishing rod. We will be putting all the components together inside this container, the day of the hackathon. Each container will have the following: an RFID sensor board, an OLED screen, a 2 ohm speaker, an MPU (gyroscope/accelerometer), a teensy with prop shield, and a 5V battery pack.THE PLATFORMA circular wooden platform that is approximately 4 ft in diameter, that fits inside the kid swimming pool.There are 6 holes in the wooden platform for sitting the fish inside. The rim of the bottom bowl for each fish sits perfectly inside each hole.There are four wheels mounted to the bottom and located towards the outside of the platform, one in each quadrant of the circle if you were to divide it into four equal parts.The motor will drive a spinning wheel under the edge of the platform that will hopefully rotate the platform smoothly.There is a hinge installed going down the middle of the wooden platform to allow for folding up of the circular wooden platform into two halves. It is divided in such a way that 3 wheels are under one half of the platform and a single wheel is under the other half of the platform. This is to allow for easier transportation.THE MOTORA hole will be made on the side of the kid swimming pool to affix the spinning driver wheel on the inside and attach it to the motor on the outside. We will test out the motor for the first time, find the right speed to play the game at, and make a control station for the motor all on the the day of the hackathon. THE INCLINING BASEFour incline wood pieces attached to a wooden pegboard with nuts and bolts.Fits under the center of the pool, had to be elevated by 2 foam sheets underneath. This helps give the fish the extra height so their mouths will fall open wider, making them easier to catch when they are on the tallest part of the incline.We will need to affix the center of the inclining base to the center of the pool the day of the hackathon to keep the inclining base from sliding around and getting caught underneath the wheels.  ', ""The most challenging aspect was thinking up the whole design of the fish and the platform, as well as thinking of what is the catch a fish condition. We ended up sticking to the engineering design of the original fish game (inclines underneath the platform lining up under some of the holes), just bigger in size. The RFID sensor reads the RFID card even when it's 2 inches away, so we needed to think of another aspect we could test for in order to detect whether someone caught a fish. In the end, we decided the win condition should be a mixture of reading the RFID code while the rod position has changed significantly to show they are still holding onto the fish while it's up in the air.

"X-Terminator Drone","Reflecting UV light off of aluminum-coated propellers of an autonomous drone can inactivate deadly viruses.","[8228, 'Spurred by wanting to find a hack that bridged each of our specialties (optical sciences, biomedical engineering, and computer science) in addition to the recent Ebola outbreak and epidemics in general, the X-Terminator Drone was born. This hack aims to reduce the risk of healthcare workers and volunteers in the face of an epidemic by using drones to UV sterilize the field.  ', 'The X-Terminator Drone uses UV light that is reflected off of sputter-coated aluminum propeller blades to inactivate viruses (by irreversibly damaging its genetic material), making them no longer deadly and unable to replicate. The ultimate application of this hack is for healthcare facilities and patient clinics to be sterilized of harmful pathogenic diseases without need for human contact with deadly viruses and pathogens. High-risk areas can be first sanitized by a drone prior to human contact. ', 'To automate the Parrot AR Drone 2.0 Elite, an Arduino Uno connected to multiple ultrasonic distance sensors was connected to the drone. Each propeller blade was sputter-coated with aluminum metal (~50nm thick) to reflect UV light. A UV light source was mounted under each propeller blade at an ideal distance from the blade to best reflect the UV light below the drone (the physics is explained on our website). Finally, the drone itself was programmed to autonomously roam a room via feedback from its distance sensors mounted in each direction, at an altitude permitting UV inactivation of viruses and pathogens.  ', ""This was a very technical hack that involved many endless hours of troubleshooting, especially since none of us had done many of the technical hardware and software hacks involved. We were new to the Arduino and drones, as well as how to build the circuits we needed. This hack first involved identifying multiple UV light sources, of which we went through a couple LED light options before our final solution. Along the way, we encountered faulty hardware, and our procedure of soldering and connecting our initial ideal higher-powered UV LED lights resulted in their electrical failure. We then had to improvise and go with another set of different LED lights that were in the UV spectrum. Next, there is little documentation of hacking a Parrot Drone with an Arduino that combines all of the endpoints we included in our hack. Beginning with wiring the circuitry on breadboards to connect multiple distance sensors to the Arduino, we encountered issues with the readout and responses that we had to troubleshoot. Part of the issues were related to the voltage, and we eventually figured this out. Next, there were differences in Drone pinouts than what was posted online, we had to identify through voltage drops and differences the functions of the pinouts, and then connect the drone to the Arduino. For many hours, we were only able to connect successfully the computer to the Arduino and receive proper printouts from the sensors, and not from the Arduino to the drone. To solve this issue, we had to seek some advice on matching the voltages between our various types of hardware in order for all of our code, hardware and sensors to communicate. Based off of the advice and feedback we received, and online forums, we put together a level converter to divide voltage that allowed communication between the sensors, drone, and Arduino to finally happen (BUT, not before we faced a malfunctioning Arduino, and after using a fresh one we figured out that this had been the problem for a couple hours). Next, we had to weigh all the components and shave off any excess weight-- considering a second voltage divider to draw less energy. After that, we had to figure out the actual hardware and mechanical mounting of the LED lights. The next challenge was consolidating all of our multiple circuits into one small and lightweight board. Then finally, we wanted to command the flight of the drone to be similar to an iRoomba vacuum. We wrote javascript to automate the this type of room sweep via drone flight movements. This was one of the toughest hacks, as it was not clear in any instructional references we could find how to actually control the drone via the Arduino while using the sensors. We spent at least a full 16 hours on trying to get the communications between the devices working. Finally, we succeeded in reflecting UV light off our of drone propellers at the end, which allowed us to consider our hack a proof-of-concept for use during an epidemic. Accomplishments that we are proud ofThe amazing collaborative teamwork and the fact my team worked together non-stop to make this happen! What an incredible effort, especially given that none of us have done much of the things we had to figure out for this hackathon. We each learned how to integrate and utilize new hardware, software components and languages, and had to draw from past science classes as far back as high school for the scientific concepts.What we learnedMany many things, already alluded to in the challenges section... mostly along the lines of working with new hardware, circuits, writing Arduino code, working with Arduino libraries, interfacing multiple technologies, hacking a drone, new/unfamiliar coding languages, etc. What's next for X-Terminator DroneTrying to find the support to turn this drone into a reality where it can be utilized out in the field.

We wanted to make a real-time head-to-head soccer that worked well with multitouch controls. ', ""Astro League is a soccer game, where players attempt to score goals by firing projectiles into the footballs in order to knock them in the right direction. The game uses custom gestures to control the firing of projectiles and the placing of 'blocker' walls, which allow a player to temporary block the path of oncoming balls. Projectiles are constrained by an ammo counter that re-fills over time, encouraging accuracy over the bullet-spam approach, although depending on the situation sometimes both work. This is a desktop Windows app that integrates with the Lenovo Aura interface. "", ""The game was developed mainly in C# using the Unity 3D engine. Most of the effort went into the custom gesture recognition and visual effects. The gestures were coded based on the raw input data from Unity's API. Whilst Unity goes a long way to help with regards to rendering, we put quite a bit of time into the custom shaders: the burnup dissolve effect of the asteroids and the convolution pixel shader ripples. Unity's own physics and mesh colliders meant that the game object interactions were mostly fairly simple to implement, meaning we had time for some polish in the competition schedule. "", ""The two main challenges we faced were performance and the integration of a touch library. I had a fantastic old multitouch library I intended on re-using, but this was not compatible with Unity's window handle, so I had to re-create it based on Unity's API. It was the first time we've hit performance issues since learning Unity, so we had to familiarise ourselves with Unity's profiling tools and in particular how Unity batches draw calls. "", ""It's always good to hit a deadline. We had some unexpected things come up and get in the way of development, but we managed to compromise on some features as appropriate to balance both getting it done and to a good standard.We're especially proud of our first custom shaders in a Unity game. Modern devices have fantastic graphics capabilities, so it's great to be able to show them off. "", 'The major learning points on this project were convolution shaders, Unity performance optimisation and the Unity touch API. ', ""Right now we have a solid little game. The next step is to let people play it and get some feedback.

"Median ","A messaging app for centralized narrative communication in a dyanamic healthcare environment.","[3592, 'The medical care industry has lacked a homogenous system for patient data tracking since the dawn of the digital era. Patients are required to repetitively fill out paperwork that details their health status every single step of the way through patient care. Whether it be a health clinic, the hospital emergency room, or a healthcare specialist, data needs to be entered and re-entered into a new system; a system that is disconnected from its counterparts, leaving both patients and professionals at the mercy of these tedious practices, instead of focusing their attention and effort to patient care. Even within a single hospital unit, patient data needs to be communicated in real-time to multiple parties, especially in intensive-care situations. Median works to get everyone: the patient, doctors, nurses, specialists on the same page and allows for the documentation of patient data in a way that is focused and allows for optimal patient care.

"Speaking Email - voice reader for email","a mobile app that reads your email out loud, with low distraction UX","[3674, ""I get lots of email and need to be up to date. Commute time is not used as well as it could be. If I could listen to my email while driving or sitting in traffic I could think about what I need to do and formulate what I need to go back to people with. This is what started my search for an app that would read out my email for me that was distraction free and could be used safely while driving. My search resulted in a realisation there was a big hole waiting to be filled by Speaking Email. How it worksThis app is basically an email program combined with speech synthesis. The email technology used is Context.IO and Gmail REST API. We render inline images and scale down fixed width elements to a mobile form factor using javascript and css. The app is built using html5 with Cordova. Users can swipe between emails and perform limited actions (archive, flag, quick reply, pause), intended to be easy to use and distraction free while driving. Texting and driving is a big issue and we've placed a lot of emphasis on driving safety, making sure there are no complex interactions. Your emails can be continuously spoken, meaning you never need to look at or touch the phone.Challenges I ran intoWe tried doing voice recognition and I learned heaps about phonemes and how that all works, but we came to a dead end and realise we needed to rewrite and use a different library so had to pause on that. I'm keen to get back to it but need to pace ourselves due to too much to do. Mobile development on Cordova using Windows has been difficult due to debugging tools being a bit faky and general slow code-debug-run cycle that you get with the build process. Emails are difficult to process with the many complex formats in the wild.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofGetting hot swapping of cordova code working for super fast dev-run cycle was great - annoying that we had to spend so long on tooling but good to manage to get it working well. Layout of emails using css and javascript was much tricker and ultimately rewarding than we expected. Making a cordova plugin using objective C was a good accomplishment. Getting our first app in the App Store just over a month ago was an exciting moment!!What I learnedLearned a lot more about email. I thought I knew a lot already, like how inline attached emails and CIDs work, but turned out there was a bit more to it with iPhone emails being multipart mixed and still containing inline images. With gmail api you have to compose messages in raw format - base 64 with mime boundaries which I've never had to do in 20 years of programming! What's next for Speaking EmailWe've just pushed a new version to the App Store, now supporting Gmail, Outlook.com, Yahoo! Mail, iCloud, or any IMAP mail server. We've also built in more customisation of how you manage your email (eg mark as read or move to folder instead of archive).

This gives customers the ability to fine tune and learn from the cards that performed best and make adjustments to their cards in the future to get better results each time. ', 'I built RokkSalt using the Laravel PHP framework and using a MySQL database to store information. I used the Infusionsoft API and the oAuth authentication method to allow users to connect to their Infusionsoft Application.

Listen to music while commuting?We're guessing you have.

Everyday distractions like crying babies and noisy neighbors hinder your productivity, your patience, and the sick fiya you're dropping in your playlist -- but they no longer need to be sources of stress.What it DoesUsing the built in microphone on your Mac OS X device, f.low is able to detect how loud your environment is and dynamically adjust your volume on-the-fly, keeping your listening experience consistent.Mapping microphone input power to decibel values using our fitting algorithm, as well as letting you set a maximum and minimum volume for f.low to work with, we achieve the sound you want, all the time.How We Built Itf.low is currently available on Mac OS X, and it's just a quick and easy port away from iOS.

"ZenPRM","Making Healthcare administration amazingly simple","[4873, 'The idea was born because we’ve solved similar problems for Hospital Systems, IPAs, ACOs and HIEs over the years. We started to see a lot of commonality in what they we’re collecting. Then when we got involved in NYS DSRIP, TCPI grants, etc. and it became apparent that the number of requirements were growing and getting more complex. Most importantly, we started to see providers and organizations participating in overlapping programs that needed to collect a lot of the same things from a lot of the same people. It was clear there was an issue here, so we built ZenPRM to go after it.   ', 'ZenPRM starts with the Collaborative Profile. This represents the basic demographic information about your participants\u200a—\u200aWho are they? What do they do? Where do they do it? Who do they work with? Etc. These are facts about the resources and not competitive secrets\u200a—\u200astuff that you’ll painstakingly curate and then put on the provider search on your web site. All of our customers and the participants themselves will work together to keep this information up-to-date. It ends up being a complete directory of the healthcare community you’re operating in and it’s not all on you to keep it updated. For the purposes of this challenge, we’re using the advanced search capabilities to find referral paths for patients at discharge.  One of the top predictors for hospital readmissions is whether or not the patient had an appropriate follow-up with their physician after discharge.

"PowerGlove 2.0","Get your power back","[2385, ""The inspiration for this project started from an idea for a virtual reality glove. The glove was going to be able to give feedback by using servos and wires to stop the hand from closing. Because we weren't familiar with developing through the Oculus Rift, we ventured to find other uses for this technology. We took a health approach after we realized that the glove could be used to help people who suffer from arthritis. We modified our original idea so that instead of  stopping the user from closing their hand, it records data about the movement of each finger.How it worksThe PowerGlove works by using flex sensors to measure the deflection of each finger. The data gets wirelessly transmitted to a computer which will analyze the raw data, filter through the invalid measurements, and store the data on a database. A common method physicians and doctors recommend for patients with arthritis do deal with their pain is simple hand and finger exercises. We have created a web app that walks through these exercises with the patient and records if the user can complete them. Challenges we ran intoSome challenges we ran into were figuring out how to communicate between the glove and the web server; finding how to wire the glove so that each movement could intrusively be measured with maximum accuracy.What I learnedWe learned about arthritis and the research going on being the condition; how to read from a serial port, parse the data, and write to a MySql database; and advanced soldering techniques.

These suggestions act as probable topics of interests that potentially serve as valuable points of reference to the user. ', 'The web application relies primarily on the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to asynchronously transcribe audio to text while also storing the timestamp of each word. This data is stored in a Python Dictionary with the words acting as keys and a list of timestamps of the word’s occurrence as the value.. To construct the relevant suggestions that the program offers, the Google Cloud Natural Language Processing API is used to identify words from the audio with high levels of “salience.” Promoting words with higher salience over sheer frequency, we prevent the inclusion of filler or common words.APIs UsedGoogle Cloud SpeechGoogle Cloud StorageGoogle Cloud DatastoreGoogle Cloud Natural LanguageGoogle Cloud  App EngineThe front-end is two styled HTML pages, one where the user can upload a file and one where the user can see the results. When the user uploads a file, we store it in the Google Cloud Storage Datastore using an API call. A python endpoint on our Flask server (described below) then processes the audio file and returns a list of keywords and a dictionary mapping each word to a list of its start times in the audio. Next, when the user tries to search for a specific word in the audio, the program will retrieve a list containing the start times of that word in the audio and allow the user to toggle between each one, very similar to the “command-F” functionality. ', 'Although the NL API provides salience scores, some manipulations had to take place in order to make them useable. While working with the API, we were faced with the decision of whether or not to remove stopwords from the text. Stopwords are short words such as “the, at, on” which provide no real significance to the meaning of the sentence. Many NLP algorithms remove stop words to better analyze phrases.For our project, we run the NL API on two sets of the audio transcripts: one containing stopwords and one with stopwords removed. This is because, as we were testing our algorithm, we noticed the API produced significantly different results for keywords depending on whether stop words were included. Since we believed both runs had useful outputs, our final output for salience takes the top five salient words from both algorithms combined. ', 'We successfully built an application that solved a tangible issue we found. With little to no experience with APIs, we were proud to be able to create a working product using three of the Google Cloud APIs.Flask server and connectQuery Cloud datastoreDeploy first Google App Engine ', 'Over the course of 36 hours, our skills improved dramatically. We learned how to build the entire pipeline starting with creating a Google Cloud account to deploying the finished product on the Google App Engine. We also learned how to build a full stack application and integrate the front-end and back-end into a working application. Additionally, we learned how to implement control flow in HTML using Jinja2. ', 'One functionality we wanted to implement but didn’t have time for was built-in sound file conversion. Currently, our program only works with .flac files and we have to run two shell commands on any other sound type file to get it to fit our requirements. Our goal for the future is to be able to call these shell commands from within the program after the user uploads a file before it is sent to the cloud storage.We are also hoping for embedded YouTube video functionality. Instead of uploading a sound file, the user can paste a link to a YouTube video. Our software would extract the audio and process it and allow the user to essentially search the video for the word they want.Finally, our current implementation only allows for single-word search in the audio file. A relatively simple but largely helpful update would be to allow the user to search for phrases within the audio.

"WiFi Helper","Share WiFi Credentials with your guests via Alexa by showing a QR Code on Echo Show or dictating it by an Echo (dot).","[9825, 'I wrote an iOS App to share the WiFi Credentials via QR Code back in the Days of iOS 10 when it was not build-in. It does not only scan those QR Codes, it creates them and managed multiple credentials. After incorporating different technologies inside the Apple ecosystem for sharing (NFC, AirPlay, iMessage, AppleWatch), it was natural for me to build a companion skill to share the WiFi settings via Alexa. Especially the Echo Show is predestined to show the QR Code to guests. The device is always hat the location of the WiFi, while I might be away with my iPhone, when my wife wants to share your wifi with guests.But a problem e.g. on parties is, that the shown QR Code disappears after a short time - this updates brings infinite displaying the Credentials. ', 'First of all, the Skill stores the WiFi credentials.There a three options to accomplish this:I) Voice OnlyBy invoking the e.g. ""set credentials"" the skill asks for the length of the WiFi Name. Then it ask for each character separately. After the last character for the WiFi Name ii asks for the length of the WiFi Passwort and then again asks for each character separately. A character answer could be:XS: only character (this might be error-prone think about m vs. n etc.) and will be interpreted as a capital characterS: the numberM: a word and the beginning character will be used as a capital characterL: ""small"" followed by a character (same as 1, but the character will be used small)L: ""large"" followed by a character (same as 1)XL: ""small"" followed by a word (same as 3, but the character will be used small)XL: ""large"" followed by a word (same as 3)XXL: ""digit"" followed by a number (same as 2)XXXL: ""special character"" followed by the name of the special character, which should be used.II) Webpage SupportIf you ask for ""connection code"" three options bring you to a website:voice only: Alexa tells you the link ""alexa.wifi.properties"" and a user specific 6 digit code, which is valid for 15 minutes. The URL leads to a webpage, where the user enters the 6 digits and if correct, a page is presented, with two fields (name and password).card: The URL (""alexa.wifi.properties"") and 6 digits are noted on a card in the Alexa App. The card also presents a qr code, wich is a link. This link directs the user directly (skipping the page for the digit code) to the page to enter the credentials .display: On an Echo Show the QR Code, URL (""alexa.wifi.properties"") and the 6 digits are also presented on the screen.III) iOS AppAs described in ""Inspiration"" I have a companion App. This app manages WiFi Credentials. If you ask the skill for the ""iPhone App"" it will give you the URL ""http://wifi.properties"" where you can find the link to the App in the Apple App Store. On the card and an Echo Show or. Spot Display it also presents a QR Code wich will directly open the App in the App Store App.If you have the App installed, you can send any stored credentials directly to the skill. Therefore the app needs to know the Alexa UserID for invoking my Webservice - like the website (see II above). So the app extends the functionality of the ""connection code"" intent and offers different ways of integrating it:You can enter the 6 digit code in a special form inside the app, the app receives the Alexa UserID from a web service and stores it locally. You can scan the QR Code inside a special form inside the app and the app extracts the Alexa UserID directly.Both forms are special, because the user gets a special hint how to invoke the skill via a speech bubble image.The Link coded in the QR Code is registered as Universal link, if it is scanned by the iOS Camera App or the URL is entered in the Safari App, my App gets invoked and directly extract the Alexa UserID.After the Skill backend has stored the WiFi Credentials for a User, it can present thoseThe user can ask for the credential set or for a specific attribute:SSID and Password (""Alexa ask Wifi Helper for the credentials"")SSID (""Alexa ask WiFi Helper for the WiFi Name"")Password (""Alexa ask WiFi Helper for the password"")The skill spells every character in detail (like small a large b special character Dollar Digit one ...). Additionally they are also shown on a Card in the Alexa App. In the credential case, the card also includes a QR Code with the WiFi Credentials, so that it can be scanned directly.On an Echo Show and an Echo Spot the Display is used, to present the written representation of the Card and in the credential case also the QR Code.On an Echo Show or an Echo Spot the skill ask to present the QR Code infinite. If yes, an audio directive starts a silent audio stream and presents the QR Code as cover image, and the credentials as meta data text. The stream restarts after 2 1/2 minutes by adding those data to the play list. The skill uses a unique toke each time, so that it will reload the credentials if they are changed in-between. The user can directly invoke this infinite presentation by asking alexa to ""... start WiFi Helper and show credentials permanently"". The best user experience of this skill is using an Echo Show, connecting the skill to the iOS App for easy credential input and showing the credentials to guest on the Echo Show, which then uses their Smart phone (even without my App) to scan the wifi credentials QR Code and automatically get access to the WiFi. ', ""The skill Backend runs on a php server. The script uses the Alexa UserID (hashed) to create an entry in a MySQL database to store the WiFi's SSID and Password. There are different kind of scripts running on the server processing those data:Skill (plain JSON parsing and creating via PHP - just minimal code, no framework, yet)QR Code Generating (using the PHP QR Code lib) used by Skill for displaying WiFi Credentials on Display / Card or the (deep)link to the webpage.Website (just some HTML,CSS and PHP code) for browser use (also supporting universal links to deep-link into the iOS app if installed).WebServices (just some PHP code) to communicate with the AppThe iOS App is written in Swift an only uses default Frameworks of apple. For the Skill this app is extended by an upper top-left skill button in the navigation bar. This invokes an menu with the options:Enabling the skill: If Alexa app is installed, a deep link is called. Otherwise a link to the amazon skill store is invoked).Connecting via QR: Start scanner for Connection Code. On the camera image, there is a speech bubble overlay, which shows the phrase how to get the connection code from an echo show.Connection via PIN: Speech bubble, which shows the phrase how to get the PIN from an echo and a form to enter itDelete connection (if there is an active one).If an Alexa UserID is linked by QR Code or PIN, the credential detail view presents a switch. If the switch gets activated, the credentials are transferred to the WebService. On the Overview View, the credential wich is stored on the skill is marked by a grey Alexa Skill icon. "", 'The Display of the Spot created some challenges:The Display is round, so the normal QR Code would lose the corners and so the scanner could not recognize it. Solution: Added an additional boarder to avoid losing the three orientation squares.The shown text is presented over the QR Code on the Spot, so some informations are lost and the scanner sometimes cannot read the data. Solution: While generating the QR Code I use the highest quality which added redundancy so that the lose of some information can be restored. Additionally I shortend the shown text to the minimum, so less information is lost. Both solutions reduces the comeliness on an Echo Show. But it is not possible to distinguish both devices, neither by the Intent request nor by the HTTP Request of the image itself.Adapting the audio player interface to the infinity image presentation hack. This means, only using it, when display is present and some additional intents to handle stoping etc. correctly. ', 'Multiple ways for the user to enter the credentials, so that he can chose the one wich suits best for her/him.VoiceOnly option for dictation of the SSID and Passwords, which usually mix small and capital letters as well as special characters and digits.The idea to quickly adapt the new audio player meta to make infinite presentation of the QR Code by presenting it as a cover image of a silent audio file. ', 'How to build an easy dialog with short interactions while offering options to handle more specific options (like the any character / word for small characters). There fore you need to handle the context, otherwise you can not distinguish a single digit as an intent to specify the length of the SSID or Password or a Digit within those (not handling this well, lead to a bad review in the beginning of the skill).

However, without the specific street knowledge gained from experience living in Boston, safety can be an issue not just for us but for the general populace as well.Our VisionWe hope to create an app that gathers data from police databases and utilizes historical data to display a heatmap of criminal activity in Boston. This app will then recommend safer areas for foot traffic and provide actual navigation instructions, avoiding areas of highly concentrated violent crime and drug related activities.Our ProcessWe scraped Boston Police arrest databases and gathered a dataset. Then, we utilized a deep neural network to create a model for geospatial crime frequency data, learning to predict the relative safety of a given area. The neutral network then evaluated the data on a variety of different locations in Boston and created a custom heatmap, which we then turned into a custom Google Maps overlay.ChallengesOur initial problem was the lack of uniformity in data structure between the variety of databases we scraped, forcing us to fallback on an amount of manual re-formatting and sorting. While there were optimization issues with the machine learning model, those were related to simple hyperparameter tuning and were overcome. The primary stumbling point was properly overlaying the crime data on the Maps rendering.

"Augmented Decision Making ","A platform that offers a fair framework for decision making process by empowering individuals ","[3571, ""Social choice has received considerable attention in AI and computer science in recent years, due to technological advances that have facilitated an explosion in the availability of ranking or preference data.Despite a great degree of personalization in recommendations and information provision, tailoring alternatives presented to specific users can be difficult for a number of reasons, including infeasibility of complete personalization. Most decisions force the choice of a single option , usually from a range of choices that maximise customer satisfaction across a target market. In such settings, a single “consensus” recommendation is made for the population as a whole.In social choice theory, the Arrow's theorem states that when voters have three or more distinct alternatives , no ranked voting electoral system can convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide ranking while also meeting a specified set of criteria: unrestricted domain, non-dictatorship, Pareto efficiency, and independence of irrelevant alternativesThe proposed alternative is using a modern voting system so as to satisfy as many criteria as possible, while considering the participatory democracy concept: involving users in the decision making process and focusing on their participation and collaboration "", 'Our platform offers users a middle ground between fully personalised choices and pure consensus recommendations in the process of decision making.The platform is an integrated part of the Mirro product and aims to benefit organisations by empowering individual employees in the fair-decision making process implied by a participatory democracy: problem identificationdebate , ideation and co-creationdrafting proposalsvoting checking that the solution has been properly deployed and actually solves the identified problem.The process aims to determine a collection of candidates that best represent the “collective interests” of the voters, by using a modern voting system, selectable by problem authors when defining the problem.

"LiveBus","Crowd-Sourced location sharing platform to provide accurate public transport location data to users","[4187, 'Public transport systems have many struggles. But for most, the biggest struggle is the uncertainty behind not having accurate information location on how far their next bus is. While some systems do implement their own GPS tracking systems, this would need a different bus app to be downloaded for each system and most systems do not even have GPS tracking. As students we use buses to get around campus all the time and need accurate location data to know whether it will come in time for class. Hence we created LiveBus to solve a widespread struggle for all Public Transport users. ', ""LiveBus utilised the powerful here.com api to load the map as well as automatically fetch the bus routes in the city based on the user's current location. The app then allows the user to select a specific bus route and see the next bus based on crowd sourced data. They will also see the path that the bus is taking to reach the user. When the bus finally arrives, the user can instantly board the bus and act as a tracker for others to see until they get off their next stop. The app checks for clusters of trackers so that the user waiting at the bus station can understand the reliability of the location data. The trackers can also indicate how crowded the bus is. Lastly the app acts sets up a medium of communication between those on the bus and those waiting to allow those waiting on the bus to get information about the status of the bus in case it has broken down or is stuck in a traffic jam.  "", ""The core of the app powerfully uses the here.com api to power the map as well as all the routes and bus stations. Then, using the web-geolocation api, we added the user's live location to the map gotten from here.com. Google cloud was used for data storage and vue.js was used to implement material design to make the UI look good and simple the use. Many web services then complemented the app to power the backend to connect the trackers with those waiting for the bus station.  "", 'One of the conceptual challenges was in whether the users would track the bus for others.

A virtual dance pad sits at your feet, and vive trackers help bring your feet into the virtual world to dance. Keeping to the tried and true DDR style, the steps the player must take come from the bottom of a virtual screen and mark the timing needed for each move.

We used two vive trackers along with custom built straps to securely fasten the trackers to the feet.

Finally, we used Unity's UI system to create the visuals and built our own parsers to read in our song data and present the visual steps to our players. "", ""Since we needed to make a song data encoding system from scratch, there needed to be a lot of prior design work to be done before any code could be written. A significant issue was figuring out how to take in the song data, and then put out the steps at the correct time, and then taking in the player's inputs to hit the spawned steps. It ended up being a very complex system that took hours to debug at one point. In addition, we used Unity Collaborate as a version control and repository system, which sometimes would overwrite one of our changes, forcing us to do the same changes again. "", ""We're very proud that the game we made ended up very much like the DDR feeling we were going for.

From the start we came up with a plan to divide work, but as parts started to come together, the pace slowed down, and we needed to keep going to finish our game.

Each template card bears the name of the list it is associated with.Why use checklist templates?For users:Checklists are added only when needed as the card moves in the processNew checklists are added on top and clearly show the required actionsFor process designers:Templates can be stored in the board or grouped in a separate boardIt is a great way to setup and document your processChanges are available immediatelyWhy automate actions when an item is checked?For users:It is simpler than using the move or archive card buttonsNo need to think about what to do nextFor process designers:You can easily embed some process logic in the cards and avoid using Zapier integrationsIt works when items are checked via the APIScreenshot 2: When a card is created in the Inbox list, the bot automatically adds the Inbox checklist. Actions such as move, archive card or add label are availableWhy call it a bot?Automatic actions are performed by the Trello user who authorized the Checklist bot power-up.Once properly configured, the ""bot"" acts in the background until desactived.How do templates work?A checklist template is simply a card bearing the name of a list and containing one or more checklists.Card templates are usually stored in a list containing all the templates associated a board.Once you\'ve told Checklist Bot where to look for the template you are all set.How do you program the bot actions?Checklist Bot detects actions after the keyword -> in text associated to checklist items.The following actions can be detected and launched:ActionDescriptionSyntaxlistMove the card to a list-> list(listName, position)listName: name of the target listposition (optional): location in the list the card will move.

Any unauthorized access to a board or an action will simply be discarded.When the user grants the authorization, the token is stored in the private settings of the power-up and is not available to other users on the client side.An open-source projectChecklist Bot Power-Up  is an internship project of Louis Jeckel.The code is open-source and available on Github and GlitchWe have chosen to open-source it for many reasons:use it as a source of education for other students and prosgive visibility to Louis (who\'s looking for an internship next summer in Southern California) and to OCTO Technologyhelp detect and solve potential security leaksWe welcome future contributors.

The glasses vibrate when your eyes close for too long, and also causes your Pebble watch to vibrate. How it was builtDigitalCoffee was built with an arduino, photon, pebble, and android phone. The arduino processes all of the information, and the photon uploads the information to a server. The server sends data to your phone, which in turn forwards the data via bluetooth to the pebble. The IR sensors detect eye movement - blink frequency and duration. There is also a tilt sensor to detect head motion. The vibration motors trigger as long as the sensors detect signs of sleeping. The blink information is forwarded to the phone app for analytics; one can see when he/she is most sleepy. Lastly, the pebble app displays raw values and alerts you via vibration/notification.The glasses were designed and 3d printed. We used multiple breadboards, wires, and parts to do everything. Also included: a button to calibrate the IR sensors.Challenges we ran intoGetting all the hardware to work properly. The biggest challenge was getting the photon to accept and transmit data from the Arduino Uno. We ran into some serious problems with transmission using RX and TX pins, but we were able to use I2C instead. It would have been much harder without Pennapps' great mentors. The hardware was also hard to calibrate as there were multiple issues with sensitivity. What's next?Minimizing the cables, making the entire module more wireless/light, more analytics and information, various smart options controlled via blinking.

"Tunnel Comet","pass through like comet goes","[6118, ""The Hsuehshan Tunnel is the main artery between Taipei and Yilan, but it can be severely clogged. After researching, our team found there are two main reasons that cause the traffic congestion in Hsuehshan Tunnel. One is there's no tool for drivers to measure interval from the front vehicle objectively. Drivers usually keep too long interval to avoid breaking the laws. It lead to decrease of car flow in Hsuehshan Tunnel. The other is some drivers driving at improper speed results in clogging up traffic behind them and decrease average driving speed. Hence, we try to design a system that can solve the problems and increase car flow and average driving speed in Hsuehshan Tunnel.雪山隧道是連結台北與宜蘭的主要幹道，但令人煩惱的是它常常有嚴重塞車的情形。經過研究後我們發現有兩個主要原因造成雪山隧道的交通壅塞，第一個是因為駕駛沒有客觀工具可以判斷和前車的車距，因此駕駛很容易為了不要觸法而拉長車距，而導致雪山隧道的單位時間車流量減少，另一個原因是有些駕駛會開在不適當的速度(烏龜車)，堵住了後方的車輛，導致後方所有車輛的平均車速降低。因此，我們想要設計一套系統來解決這些問題，提升雪山隧道內的單位時間車流量和平均車速。 "", 'Tunnel Comet provide visualized guides for drivers in Hsuehshan Tunnel to drive properly. It would base on the conditions around the vehicle and show appropriate visualized guide in front of the vehicle to suggest driver to accelerate, decelerate or maintain current speed. By guiding drivers driving at optimal speed and interval, Tunnel Comet leads to significant improvement in traffic. The efficiency is proved in simulation system.Since all vehicle would pass through the tunnel with visualized guide in front just like comet goes. Hence we named this system “Tunnel Comet”.雪隧彗星提供駕駛視覺導航，來幫助駕駛能更適當的行車。它會根據車輛附近的情況，在車輛前方提示出適當的視覺引導，來建議駕駛加速、減速或維持目前速度。藉由引導駕駛在最佳的速度和車距行車，雪隧彗星大幅改善了交通狀況，它的效益已在模擬系統中證實。由於所有的車輛在穿過隧道時，都會有視覺導航一直在前方，就像彗星要離去的樣貌，因此我們把這套系統命名為—雪隧彗星。 ', 'Simulation System:In the beginning, we try to prove the efficiency of Tunnel Comet. We built a simulation system in unity which has two-lane traffic in the tunnel. Both lane is simulated with AI cars running on it, while one lane is normal road and the other lane is Tunnel Comet road. Tunnel Comet road is setting up sensors to detect car pass through and light patterns to serve as visualized guides. By this design, user can carry out the comparison between normal road and Tunnel Comet road. Furthermore, the simulation system has two mode – God mode and player mode. In God mode, user can observe whole tunnel in god view and see the objective traffic statistics of each lane. In player mode, user can experience the driving in first person view and even VR(virtual reality) view if user has VR glasses. These two mode also allow us to make sure the strategy of Tunnel Comet is appropriate and the driving experience is comfortable.Prototype:After proving the efficiency of Tunnel Comet, we built a prototype of Tunnel Comet road. It contains four ultrasonic ranging modules and three LED lights to form a segment of road. We used an Arduino board to connect all components and implement same strategy algorithm as simulation system on it.模擬系統:首先，我們為了驗證雪隧彗星的效益，我們用Unity製作了一套模擬系統，裡面的隧道有雙線道，兩個線道都會人工智慧車輛在上面行駛，而兩個線道一個分別為普通道路，一個被製作為雪隧彗星道路，雪隧彗星道路設置了很多感測器來偵測通過車輛和特殊圖案來做為視覺導航，藉由這個設計，使用者可以清楚地對普通道路和雪隧彗星道路進行比較，此外，模擬系統有兩種模式，分別為上帝模式和玩家模式，在上帝模式，使用者可以以上帝視角觀察整個隧道，並且有兩個線道客觀的交通數據供審視，在玩家模式，使用者可以以第一人稱視角體驗行車，甚至若使用者有虛擬實境眼鏡，甚至可以虛擬實境視角體驗行車，這兩個模式讓我們可以確保雪隧彗星的策略是適當的，並且行車體驗是舒適的。硬體雛型:在驗證雪隧彗星的效益之後，我們製作了雪隧彗星道路的雛型，它由四個超音波測距模組和三個LED燈構成一段道路，我們用Arduino電路板統合這些組件，並在上面實作和模擬系統一樣的策略演算法。 ', ""Although the concept of Tunnel Comet is simple, but the appropriate guiding strategy must be well-designed. At first we found that too simple or sensitive design could cause Bullwhip effect in traffic. The guiding strategy must avoid providing improper acceleration and deceleration guides and should be capable of absorb Bullwhip effect. While designing the guiding strategy, we have to consider not only the interval but also the relative speed of the vehicles. Another challenge is how to design appropriate visualized guide patterns. Improper guide patterns design like not intuitive, too complicated or flashing would not only cause misunderstanding, but also lead to distraction and even dizziness.雖然雪隧彗星的概念很簡單，但實際上適當的導航策略需要很完善的設計，起初我們發現太簡單的設計或太敏感的設計都會造成交通狀況上的長鞭效應，導航策略必須避免不適當的引導加速和減速，並且要有能力吸收長鞭效應，因此在設計導航策略的時候，我們不只需要考量車距問題，還需要考量車輛彼此的相對速度。另一個挑戰是對於視覺導航圖形的設計，不適當的設計，例如不直覺、太複雜或閃爍等，除了可能造成誤解，還可能造成分心甚至暈眩。Accomplishments that we’re proud of1.Think up an excellent solution to improve the traffic in Hsuehshan Tunnel.2.Build a powerful simulation system which prove the efficiency of Tunnel Comet, and also serve as a perfect platform for us to test the guiding strategy and driving experience.3.Build a prototype with complete function by hardware component.4.Give this system a cool name – “Tunnel Comet”5.Work as perfect team and have a lot of fun1.發想出一個出色的解決方案來改善雪山隧道內的交通狀況。2.製作一套強大的模擬系統，驗證了雪隧彗星的效應，同時也作為一個完美的平台讓我們可以測試導航策略和行車體驗。3.製作一個功能齊全的硬體雛型。4.為這個系統取一個很酷的名字—“雪隧彗星”5.做為一個完美的團隊一起完成這項作品，並得到很多樂趣。What we learned1.Designing an excellent system requires comprehensive consideration in every detail.2.Knowledge about traffic congestion.3.Technique in developing system with Unity and Arduino1.設計一個出色的系統，需要在每個細節上的周全考量。2.關於交通壅塞的知識3.使用Unity和Arduino開發系統的技術What's next for Tunnel Comet1.Keep improving guiding strategy and visualized guide patterns design of Tunnel Comet.2.Apply the concept to urban traffic and develop other vehicle locating and guiding technology that can cooperate with current system.

"wells","Wells is a smart bottle cap that tracks your water intake, boosting your well-being one drop at a time.","[2742, 'wells is a brainchild of a group of friends from Imperial College London and UCL. Being passionate about innovations in health tech and quantified self, we were surprised by how little our increasingly health-conscious society knows about one of the key parts of lifestyle - water intake. Drinking enough water is essential for maintaining our health and overall well-being. However, many people either do not realize the importance of water intake or simply do not know how much they should drink. Dehydration can contribute to an array of medical complications. Drinking enough water helps a balanced body and mind, making hydration equally important for athletes, scholars and patients alike. ', 'wells consists of two components: the smart bottle cap fitting every standard PET bottle and a smartphone app. Using the wells app, user is provided with a recommended water intake for the day based on their personal metrics and current activity levels. The autonomous cap measures the amount of water that flows out through its seal and data is collected and displayed via the app. The user can see their progress and receive push notifications reminding them to follow the recommended intake.  ', ""The measurement is compromised by a specifically developed cap to suit every PET plastic bottle. In its inner canal an adapted mechanical turbine is located to provide data about speed of flow of liquid. The signal is being processed by a special System on a Chip that is able to track the speed of rotation of the turbine and thus the liquid and provide the output data via Bluetooth to a smartphone with a wells application. The whole system is powered by a battery that is wirelessly charged via Qi standards, that enables to store data in case of application and the cap being disconnected. The measurement is thus reliable, energy efficient and comfortable for the user.The wells website is available here and supporting code for the app can be found in the links below.What's next for wellsOur mission with wells is to improve your hydration via a simple, smart experience.

"SAN - Soil Analyzer Network","Simple, extendable, scalable monitoring solution","[6281, ""California is the largest economy in the United States, it accounts for more than 13% of its gross state product (GSP) and by itself it's comparable to the many countries of the world. Its agriculture is a very important, multibillion dollar sector that consists of more than 75 000 farms and ranches that have been hurt by the recent droughts. To help fight the droughts modern day farms use large irrigation systems with vast water requirements. Smart management of this precious resource is a must.Luckily, with today’s technologies we can hack the solution. "", 'The challenge is to help mitigate California\'s water crisis by using smart interconnected devices or with what is commonly known as Internet of Things. We have come up with a solution that optimizes water consumption of the irrigation systems with the goal to reduce overall strain on this precious resource.Our solution consists of two parts, low power soil moisture sensor probes that are scattered across the field, and cloud computing. By using a simple wireless communication protocol, probes aggregate information about certain sectors of the farm\'s soil and propagate information to Samsung Artik. There, the data is analyzed and used to control the irrigation system, while offering the farmer complete control and overview. Additionally, nodes are based on low power microcontroller that collects the data from capacitive moisture sensor. They are solar powered with battery backup. Data can be propagated from the farthest to the closets node by using a mesh networking algorithm. This setup allows us to build scalable solution which can be custom fitted for a wide range of cases.Our user interface is implemented by using Web 2.0 technologies.

"Smart Floating Farm","Cultivate the future, start from the sea","[9971, 'We want to help peopleWe see that local people in Coastal area and Remote Islands having difficulty in planting horticulture because they face the problem of land limitations. We have an idea about making floating platform so people can grow their vegetables at coastal area.We inspired by GROASIS, Seawater Greenhouse, and Hamster Ball-Shaped Solarball. They can grow plants at desert area and have a pure water using desalination process.Hopefully this platform can help local people to reduce their dependence on supply from mainland, help them make their own food independence and also help to make more money from selling the harvest vegetables. We also can manage these process with supllying seed, provide consultation to user, and preparing the market to sell the vegetables. ', 'SMART FLOATING FARM (SFF) PLATFORM BUILD TO RECORD, MONITOR, AND MAKE DECISION BASED ON THE RECORD.Initialize sensors and outputThis platform will initialize serial, lcd, RTC (real time clock), sensors, and motor. If RTC cannot be detected, LCD will display error and user must fix it. After RTC is ok, Arduino101 will check communication with ESP8266. Arduino101 send ""AT"" and wait ""OK"" from ESP8266.Get threshold from ServerAfter receiving ""OK"", Arduino will command ESP8266 as station mode and get parameter threshold from Server.  These threshold value used to ensure plants are in the range that has been determined by the user. SFF send GET method to server (This link used to receive sensors threshold). Parameter threshold will be saved as variable.Sensor MeasurementThis platform record these parameters : soil moisture & temperature, greenhouse temperature & humidity, greenhouse smoke detection, vibration, plant height, time, and light intensity.Sending Data to ServerData from sensor compiled as String and send it to Web by ESP8266 using POST method (Go to this link to send data to WebServer; Visit this link to see data that received by WebServer from Platform).Output ActionArduino101 check data measurement with threshold received from Server. Based on these threshold, platform will give command automatically to activate LED indicator, water pump, exhaust fan and LED lamps based on sensors reading. After 10 seconds, platform will delay few minutes before the next measurement. While waiting, Arduino101 measure gyro value.Smart Floating Farm DashboardUser can see data send to Server using this dashboard. This dashboard will give all information from sensor graphically. All data can be found at irwanrudy github repo.Smart Floating Farm Dashboard/GUI ', 'Google SketchUpGoogle SketchUp used to make the platform 3D design. We have made 3D model of Smart Floating Farm. We simplify our model for Intel hackathon.Smart Floating Farm 3D DesignWe make dashboard with HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. To add style we use Bootstrap and make interactive chart use Highcharts. We make it eye-catching for everyone that using the dashboard. FritzingFritzing used for the design of electronics hardware to support us in sensors configuration with Arduino101. We used internal and external libraries to make this visualization.Smart Floating Farm Sensors and Outputs Configuration-Fritzing designArduino IDEWe use Arduino IDE to built the firmware. We use libraries from internal Arduino IDE and from internet. For external library, we used  SEEED RGB LCD , Adafruit DHT11 , Adafruit RTC , Adafruit ADS1115 , MQ02 Gas Sensor, Dallas DS18B20 , Rotation from Gyro & Accelerometer, Time Alarm , and Time Lib . For internal library, we used Wire, pitches.h, CurieIMU and Software Serial. We used Mario Bros Tune developed by Dipto Pratyaksa to play sound at the beginning. IMU rotation angle we got from Erikyo. SFF Arduino sketch can be found at MANTIS GITHUB.Eagle LayoutWe build our own shield to make easier in pin connection. We used Eagle Software to build the schematic and board..Smart Floating Farm Custom Shield ', ""When we start submit our idea to Intel, we decide to use SIM900 GSM Module because we have some problem with ESP8266. As time goes by, we facing problem with Software Serial communication between SIM900 and Arduino101. SIM900 using 5 volt in communication and Arduino101 using 3.3 volt. We thought this difference in voltage maybe the main problem why Software Serial wasn't work. After that, we decide switch to ESP8266. We used Custom ESp8266 module from GeraiCerdas named MCCloud. ESP8266 using 3.3 volt as main voltage, same with Arduino101. But Unfortunately, we still facing the same problem. We tried to solve this problem by searching in the internet but no luck. Suddenly, we tried switch the keyword from Arduino101 to Arduino Due. Voila, we got the solution. We add pinMode (rx, INPUT) and pinMode (tx, OUTPUT) to ensure Software Serial works.We also encountered problem with relay. We used this relay. The problem is relay must powered by 5 volt so relay can switch from OFF to ON. we come with solution using pinMode (relay_pin, INPUT) and connect one relay pin to 5 volt and the other to Arduino101 Digital Pin. With pinMode we ensure that the voltage through relay will 5 volt.Sometimes, we connect sensor wrong so we must soldered again. We tried to write down in a paper the wire color and the pin, so we can remember and not wrong soldering the sensor.Arduino101 have problem when we upload the firmware. We often press MASTER_RESET button to upload the firmware. Arduino101 also must powered by adapter before connect it to computer. We experience our Arduino101 died and cannot recognized by computer. We dont know the fault because we never did something wrong to Arduino101. We think it is because the board. Board getting hot when we connect it to adapter. But, after we have another Arduino101, it is OK until right now.We encountered challenge to understand AT Command from ESP8266. Article from luciorocha, alselectro, fuho, Electrodragon, and ReiLabs very helpfull to make us understand how to use ESP8266. Before we connect ESP8266 with Arduino101, we tried AT Command using UART to TTL adapter.UART to TTLTrying GET and POST method was very challenging because we must communicate between Arduino division and IT division to decide the link for getting threshold and sending data.Arduino101 cannot use every external exist library in the internet. We came with problem when we use custom/indie library such as DS1307 library and I2C LCD 16x2.IMU Arduino101 must be updated all time. When we tried to make delay about five minutes, Arduino101 cant get the gyro real value. So we decide to read gyro value in the delay time to ensure we get the right gyro value.For dashboard challenge is make live chart using Highcharts. Because the technology is new for us, so we need to learn deeply to make it live. It can be see at SFF dashboard. "", 'We able to understand and using ESP AT Command using GET and POST method.We able to use Arduino101 Internal IMU.

"Fish-o-Tron","An end-to end solution for easily measuring &amp; tracking fish!","[3060, ""After reading the problem statement and chatting to Harry yesterday, who has worked in Fisheries for several years, we realised that there was a pressing need for a faster way to measure and record information about fish. The current procedure involves manually measuring several properties, recording the data offline, and then manually transcribing it into a spreadsheet for data analysis. We knew there had to be a better way.How it worksBy using state of the art computer vision technology, we are able to measure the length of a fish placed on our special board by using an overhead camera. Using this technique, and by averaging multiple readings and rejecting anomalies, we can obtain an average accuracy of +-5mm, which much better than the vast majority of manual readings, and significantly faster [approximately 1 second measurement time per fish]. We automatically upload this information to a public website which we have developed (visible here: http://fishotron.fyquah.me/ ) , where people can see information about the fish, as well as edit it. This enables simple, real-time auditing from interested organisations, as well as an easy way to increase engagement with the public, as they can discover just where their fish came from, using uploaded GPS data.Challenges and solutionsComputer vision is difficult! We initally tried to create tracking points (known as 'fiducial markers') by hand, and then identify them. However this was extremely challenging, and did not allow us to differentiate separate tracking points. By switching to using an external library, integrated into our code, we can very precisely track the location, rotation, ID and skew of multiple points in real time - allowing our software to work, even when the camera is not precisely positioned over the paper.Accomplishments that we are proud ofLearning to use OpenCV was great fun - it's a beautifully designed library, with a host of awesome features.

"LSDai","Earn Compound interest with your rDai collateral, while providing liquidity for hedges against variable Compound interest. Get high on interest! ","[6098, 'In a world of roller-coaster crypto volatility, we turned to Dai for stability. With the emergence of interest generating instruments born through layers of collateralization on crypto native synthetic assets, we are entering a phase of interest rate volatility. Introducing LSDai, for your escape to a peace of mind: earn Compound interest on your collateral with rDai, while providing liquidity for hedges against variable Compound interest.  Empirical studies from traditional finance have shown the adverse impact of variability in interest rates (the “price” of money) on the real economy. Accordingly, interest rate swap, used by non-financial firms in the management of the interest rate risk of their debt, is one of the most important fixed-income instrument in the trading and hedging of interest rate risk. An alternative to interest rate swap, Eurodollar futures, is the biggest and most liquid futures market traded in the US by volume. We have seen recent wild swings of Compound interest on Dai, going from 5% to peaking over 16% within a month. With the emergence of DeFi stack, more synthetic crypto assets composed of native assets are created and then rebundled on the Ethereum tech stack, enabling new possibilities while introducing complex interdependencies into the system. This is why we are creating LSDai.market, for hedgers and speculators to take leveraged long and short positions on Dai interest rates without borrowing by simply buying and selling LongDi and ShortDi tokens. ', 'LSDai creates a Euro-dollar like construct, that is a future on the Compound Dai lending rate over the duration of the contract. By leveraging Market Protocol which takes on the approach of constructing index futures via ""iron-cross options"" approach, LSDai de-couples the risk of the two sides via long and short position tokens.It enables three different types of users to gain the kind of exposure to the interest rate fluctuation that fits their profile, while aligns incentives.Hedgers: Hedgers are lending out their Dai on Compound and earn interest, but fear that the interest rate — thus, their passive revenue — will drop. LSDai’s Market Makers mint and sell them short Dai interest tokens for Dai, in the amount that will completely hedge their interest-earning position. This means they will experience no fluctuation: if the interest rate drops, the profit from the short will make them even, and if the rate goes up, the extra interest makes up for their loss. Hedgers can insure themselves against loss of income.Speculators: These players have no stake in the lending business, they just want to speculate on the changes in the interest rate. Bettors expect Dai’s lending interest rate on Compound to go up or down, and buy long or short Dai interest tokens from the LSDai Market Makers for Dai. They either gain or lose money, depending on where the interest rate goes… and how clear their mind was when they made their bet.Market makers: Market makers manage the minting and selling of the long or short Dai interest tokens ', 'We took a decentralized approach, adopting Market Protocol in decoupling the interest rate swap positions into margin-embedded Long and Short position tokens. We used Airswap to find the price of the Long ad Short position tokens. Given the importance of liquidity in the model, we programmed a bot to arbitrage away the spread across the Market Makers (Minters) of the token pairs and the Hedgers/Speculators.Lastly, in order to create virtuous loop to further incentivize the Market Makers, we implemented rDai as the collateral in Market Protocol in Minting of the position pair. Thus, Market Makers will be able to earn interest from the rDai collateral, in addition to earning the spread.For this hackathon, we are able to start from scratch and launch our LSDai on Ethereum Main Net. Since we are the first Market Maker in this product, we have decided to donate the interest accrued from rDai in the collateral to EthBerlin.  ', 'Figure out how to take a contract that is written to provide assets priced in dollars and invent a pricing structure for the interest rate swap, and how the pricing structure may fit into the existing Market Protocol smart contract that we have already deployed on Kovan.

"DeFake","Automatic DeepFake detection: protecting democracy from the next wave of misinformation. Uses machine learning to detect whether videos are authentic or deepfakes.","[5737, ""The upcoming election season is predicted to be drowned out by mass influx of fake news. Deepfakes are a new method to impersonate famous figures saying fictional things, and could be particularly influential in the outcome of this and future elections. With international misinformation becoming more common, we wanted to develop a level of protection and reality for users. Facebook's Deepfake Detection Challenge, which aims to crowdsource ideas, inspired us to approach this issue. "", 'Our Chrome extension processes the current video the user is watching. The video is first scanned using AWS to identify the politician/celebrity in subject. Knowing the public figure allows the app to choose the model trained by machine learning to identify Deepfakes targeting that specific celebrity. The result of the deep fake analysis are then shown to the user through the chrome extension, allowing the user to see in the moment whether a video might be authentic or forged.Our Web app offers the same service, and includes a prompt that describes this issue to users. Users are able to upload a link to any video they are concerned may be tampered with, and receive a result regarding the authenticity of the video. ', ""We used the PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to build the model by hand, and broke down the video into one second frames. Previous research has evaluated the mouths of the deepfake videos, and noticed that these are altered, as are the general facial movements of a person. For example, previous algorithms have looked at mannerisms of politicians and detected when these mannerisms differed in a deepfake video. However, this is computationally a very costly process, and current methods are only utilized in a research settings.Each frame is then analyzed with six different concavity values that train the model. Testing data is then used to try the model, which was trained in a Linear Kernel (Support Vector Machine). The Chrome extension is done in JS and HTML, and the other algorithms are in Python.The testing data set is comprised from the user's current browser video, and the training set is composed of Google Images of the celebrity.

', 'We are proud to have created our own model and make the ML algorithm work! It was very satisfying to see the PCA clusters, and graph the values into groups within the Support Vector Machine. Furthermore, getting each of the components ie, Flask and Chrome extension to work was gratifying, as we had little prior experience in regards to transferring data between applications. We are able to successfully determine if a video is a deep fake, and notify the person in real time if they may be viewing tampered content!

"", 'Train the model with more celebrities and get the chrome extension to output whether the videos in your feed are DeepFakes or not as you scroll. Specifically, this would be done by decreasing the run time of the machine learning algorithm in the background. Although the algorithm is not as computationally costly as conventional algorithms created by experts, the run time barrs exact real-time feedback within seconds. We would also like to use the Facebooks DeepFake datasets when they are released.Specifically, deepfakes are more likely to become a potent tool of cyber-stalking and bullying in the short term, says Henry Ajder, an analyst at Deeptrace.

I've always built webapps and I just finished an ML class so I wanted to try it out. Plus, now we can see if art can be scientifically generated? "", 'Sonata in Python reads in a series of MIDI files, mostly piano sonatas by Mozart or Beethoven. This acts as the training set for the neural network. The input nodes for the network take the duration and frequency of the preceding 5 notes as well as the current note, the preceding 3 chord progressions, and the corresponding note on the other clef. The output nodes produce the duration and frequency of the next note in the sequence, which is fed back as an input for the subsequent note. ', ""There is one neural network for the treble clef (right hand) and one for the bass clef (left hand). This is because the higher right hand notes often play a unique melody, while the lower left hand notes are often repeated, slower chords. I wanted to make sure these two very separate styles of music didn't confuse the neural network.  "", 'The biggest challenge is that feeding outputs back into the neural network will cause the network to converge. In the beginning, my compositions often converged to a single, repeating note. This produced extremely boring music. I fixed this by introducing mutations to the network. First I tried to sample a Gaussian distribution based on the mean and standard deviation of the error vectors. Then, I switched to a small percentage of changing the note by a perfect fifth or a perfect octave, both of which do not affect the flow of the music much. Furthermore, both the treble and bass clefs converged to the same note. I fixed this problem by splitting the the network in two, as mentioned earlier. Finally, neural networks do not give very exact predictions. Unfortunately, in music, even the slightest deviation will cause the music to sound out of tune. I often had quarter tones and random durations of notes. I fixed this by rounding the pitch and duration, which significantly increased the quality of the music. ', ""I'm proud of having done this project alone. I've been to a lot of hackathons in past years, but always under the tutelage of upperclassmen. Now that they've graduated, I'm sort of wondering on my own. I'm glad I was able to accomplish this project without others directing me. I'm also proud of how far I came with this project. I compared my first generated sonata to my most recent one and I was really impressed with how good the latter one sounded. Perhaps not yet at the level of Mozart, but it's certainly come a long way.  "", ""Music is hard! 36 hours is not enough to create an algorithm that can generate music that has been endeared for centuries.

Technically, I already knew this, but to be able to produce this quality of a music generating, machine learning algorithm in under 250 lines is incredible. Yes, I only wrote 250 [very well thought out and tested via trial and error!] lines. Python is life.I was also introduced to pybrain and music21, Python libraries used for neural networks and analyzing music, respectively. Both of these are very well made and I hope I have an opportunity to explore more of their features in future projects.Also, I had to learn a lot of stat. It was pretty uncomfortable, and I'm not a fan... "", ""Obviously, more fine tuning of parameters in order to produce even more beautiful music. While I did consider chords in the neural network, harmony is probably the most important missing feature. Harmony analysis is a 36 hour project on its own, and would greatly improve the project. In addition, I'm hoping to expand to concertos and contemporary music. Sonatas are fairly easier because they are generally piano only, with only a left and right hand. Opening to more types of music would be very fun.PS. Unfortunately, I have no pictures! There's not much to show about a neural network...

From his own experience, and from countless interviews with highly successful people, Nick understood the many benefits of keeping a personal record of one\'s daily life and experiences.  Unfortunately, after testing every well-known journaling product available, Nick struggled to find a platform that fit his needs.  Specifically, he wanted a solution that was:   Portable (available for both Web and mobile)   Easy to use   Easy to manage   Flexible (supporting multiple platforms, email integrations, etc.)   Designed to handle both public and private journal types   Built with features to simplify collaboration and sharing of public entries   Capable of exporting content or publishing to a hardbound bookWhat is JRNL?At JRNL, we believe that Life is Worth Recording, and that by keeping and reflecting upon past experiences, we can better address future challenges.

To date, it has registered just over 65,000 users who, in turn, have created over one million unique posts.  It\'s important to note that the product is ""in the wild"" and we are iterating and making improvements based upon user feedback.The platform is supported by an experienced team of developers and operators, with multiple successful ventures, numerous industry awards (over 40 combined), and well over $4 Billion in value created.Key members include:Nick Jones - Founder, Lead Visionary   16+ Years Management, Marketing & Operations Experience    Brand Consultant to Wrangler, Special Olympics & Mandalay ResortsSteve Reed - Co-Founder, Lead Designer   13+ Years Branding and Graphic / Web Design Experience   Past work recognized by Wired and MSNBCJay Goodwin - Chief Architect   16+ Years Senior Software Development Experience    Previous teams have won dozens of industry awardsGlenn Argenbright - Advisor & Board Member   19+ Years Executive Experience   Six High Value Exits as Founder or CEO – 3 IPOs / 3 AcquisitionsHow it was builtOur product team consists of seven designers and developers working out of two distinct locations, separated by a two hour time differential.  Fortunately, the team was broken into two groups, each with a unique set of skills and responsibilities.  One team focused on backend processes and all Web application development, while the other team focused on Mobile development and front-end UI design.  This allowed us to minimize the impact of working with two remote development teams. The remote nature of the team also impacted certain design decisions.  Realizing that we wanted multi-platform compatibility and a consistent user experience, we decided to go with a microservices based architecture.  The Web platform was originally built as a single page application, using the React Javascript Framework.  The app communicates with the Web Server via http and https calls, to a Django based backend.  For mobile, we originally used Xamarin Forms, communicating via http and https to the same backend as our Web application.  We will likely move away from Xamarin in the future.For data storage, we use a mix of three technologies.  Specifically, MariaDB, Elasticsearch, and Redis.  We opted to use a cloud based hosting provider, so that we could rapidly scale resources as needed, and to reduce ongoing operational overhead.Challenges We EncounteredTeam:  Operating remote teams presents numerous challenges.  We’ve had to work hard to avoid or minimize communication breakdowns, scheduling misunderstandings (due to time zones), unclear design requirements, poor prioritization, faulty expectations, focus drift, feature creep, and overall clarity of the product vision.  Additionally, team members varied significantly in terms of both overall experience and technical knowledge, which was only amplified by the remote nature of our work environments.  This necessitated additional time for training and education, as well as a more structured communication methodology.Tech:  On the Web app side, the choice of React was a risk due to its relative lack of maturity as a platform, combined with our own learning curve and an associated lack of available documentation, best practices, and other materials relating to the platform.  As an example, we initially chose to use the React Flux framework provided by Facebook, combined with datastore and API abstraction libraries with which we were already familiar.  This proved challenging, because the tools lacked maturity, and because we were attempting to use old methodologies (depending on old libraries), rather than leveraging the various benefits inherent in React.  After a few false starts, we settled on Redux as a full replacement for all existing datastores, which proved prescient given that the React community has now, for the most part, settled on Redux as a best practices approach.Product:  Initially, we designed the product as a single-user private journaling tool but, as the product progressed, we recognized a real need for private, semi-public and public journals, offering the ability to share content and collaborate with others, in order to create a more complete record.  However, through this process, we soon learned that sharing and collaboration, at least in terms of journaling, is not nearly as simple and obvious as initially thought.  One obvious challenge revolves around content ownership.  In a private journal, it is quite obvious who owns the content, but that understanding breaks down as soon as you share the content with others and allow them to contribute to the journal.  As an example, if I invite Sally to collaborate on a specific event or entry, who then owns the content - both of us, neither, me, or Sally?  Taking this even further, if I invite her to collaborate on my journal, can she then invite others to collaborate as well?  When we first started talking about sharing, we found that each person looked at it differently, depending on their experience.  Some focused on social sharing (Facebook and other social networks), some focused on permission-based sharing (Dropbox), and still others focused on email or other legacy-based sharing options (forums, listservs, etc.).  In fact, it’s become clear to us that journaling presents its own challenges with respect to both sharing and collaboration, and we had to create rules and functionality to account for each of the three paradigms mentioned above, while at the same time making sure that our users understand the implications of such actions with regards to their content.Accomplishments We\'re Proud OfThere are many things that we’re proud of as a team.  For the most part, such items can be broken out into two categories - inward facing, “operational” issues, and outward facing, “product” issues.Operational items include:   The successful management of remote development teams   The ability to attract “top tier” talent on a limited budget   The ability to address and account for complex sharing issues far beyond other offerings   That we’ve remained true to our core principals.  We always respect user privacy, even when looking at concepts such as sharing and collaboration.  This is very different from Facebook and other well-known social platformsProduct items include:   The knowledge that we’ve helped many families capture their history and produce books creating a generational link for the future   The creation of unique habit building tools, and their impact on journaling (as evidenced by the total volume of posts created)   The many ways we’ve simplified and made journaling more accessibleWhat We LearnedMost of what we’ve learned thus far is the direct result of user feedback.  Through research, surveys, and unsolicited user comments, we know there is a great demand for reminders, prompts and other tools to maximize the journaling experience.  In fact, habit creation tools and other prompts to battle writer’s block, and to encourage daily activity, are among the most often requested items from our users. We’ve also learned that this is a complex problem.  This explains why existing solutions continue to struggle when it comes to addressing key areas of concern.  This fact is further complicated by the reality that any associated product must be easy to use - otherwise, users won’t journal on a regular basis.  However, as one might expect, building simple solutions for complex problems is no small task.  We believe that current rates of user adoption (65k+ beta users) and high levels of daily engagement (1M+ posts), show that we’re on the right path.What\'s Next For JRNL?As noted above, we are currently expanding our sharing and collaboration toolsets.  In addition, we plan to greatly expand our current “habit building tools,” offering specialized categories and subcategories so that users can customize the prompts they are likely to see.  This work will also tie in to customized journaling types and templates (camping, cooking, travel, fitness, diet, etc.).  We are also looking at ways that people might contribute to journals through voice / text transcription through the mobile app (or via a microphone).  We also plan to add various legacy components in 2016, allowing users to send individual messages (or complete journals) to friends and family members at some predetermined date in the future (or upon the completion of certain triggering events).Built Withdjangoelasticsearchmariadbnode.jsreactredisreduxxamarinTry it outwww.jrnl.com      Submitted to    RootsTech Innovator Showdown    Created by  Brand, project creation, fund raising, team building, management, and every other hat that goes with a startup.Nick JonesBranding, web design, UX/UI, front-end development, and marketing materials for JRNL.Steve ReedJay GoodwinAmy VelozJay Goodwin ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['react', 'django', 'node.js', 'mariadb', 'elasticsearch', 'redis', 'xamarin', 'redux']","False","10","['jrnl', 'nickjones', 'notjay', 'amyveloz', 'stev3reed']","https://firefly-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/usercontent/fill/242/161/cGhvdG9zL3Byb2R1Y3Rpb24vc29mdHdhcmVfdGh1bWJuYWlsX3Bob3Rvcy8wMDAvMzI4Lzc5MC9kYXRhcy9vcmlnaW5hbC5qcGc=/devpost-thumb.jpg?signature=7aca8e550bf590288db032e58e7858d8c89c2fff","True","2"
"Pigeon Point","Summarizes flooded and nasty group chats into topics with clean bullet points of key events.","[4030, ""Everyone has those friends who just add you to their group chats, and then you get incessantly flooded with notifications. After muting conversations, you'll miss invitations and key messages, mainly because you didn't see them. Now there's a way to manage your notifications and be sure that you miss out.It was especially helpful for the TreeHacks Slack group. Especially since we're hacking, we preferred not to be notified much, or spend time just to see where lunch is. It also helped us find out that a guy just dropped off an Echo in the hardware booth, and we promptly intercepted it from another team. :DWe also built this for accessibility. Most people with vision disorders or physical disabilities have a hard time talking to their friends (since most of us use instant messaging, not calls). Our project would allow these people to have the Echo talk to them and basically act as their social assistant. "", ""To summarize group messages from GroupMe, you could tell Alexa to summarize whichever group you want. She'll then tell you what topics were discussed, and the main points said in each topic. She'll even tell you about what certain people were feeling. If you don't fully understand the messages, you could ask her for the context, and she'll tell you what was said before and after. The same functions work if you want your Slack messages summarized.For Slack specifically, we built a Slackbot, which you could enter your commands to select which group to summarize. All the other functions above apply here too!  "", ""For the summarization itself, we implemented Jolo Balbin's thesis on summarizing a single topic text block. It involved finding the most common ideas, and ranking the sentences based on how similar they were to other sentences. This was coded in Python, and lives inside an AWS Lambda function. Most group chats have many conversations going on though, so we also built a classifier function using IBM Alchemy's concept extractor and clustered similar words together using NLTK. We then ran the summarization script on each of the specific conversation topics and got out key points.The Slack Bot was hosted using a Python flask image running on Microsoft Azure, that's where all the API calls and data lived. This was called on by the Lambda function on AWS. We then used our Lambda function and Azure backend to link functionality to the Echo. "", ""We had a hard time when we first ran our summarizer on the Slack conversations, because it wasn't optimized for multiple topics. We fixed this by splitting the conversation.It was hard to get our hands on an Echo, so we developed most of it without being able to see results on the go. Our Slack summarization backend saved us though. Also, we had a hard time deploying packages on AWS because it needed us to make special versions of NLTK and other packages to run. "", ""We're particularly proud about implementing one of NLP's hardest problems, and how we worked around the limitations of the thesis by classifying messages.Also, we're proud of building something that would help us and almost everyone, and how it helps a certain segment greatly.

The device will continuously report the SPL to Exosite, but will make its best effort to report an aircraft event when its native algorithm makes an appropriate determination. The reason for the analysis of the audio timbre processing on the device is to keep a large portion of the signal processing performed on the gear the user/community has already paid for. It makes no sense to do processing in the cloud when a cheap device is capable of it as well. This will keep the cost of the IoT solution down.MAC currently has 39 listening towers. From this picture one can easily see there are underserved neighborhoods. The aim of this project is to crowd-source the datacollection and provide another means of accountability for airport noise.

"Tobii Ghost - Eye Tracking Twitch Extension","An extension that allow viewers to see where the streamer is looking at the screen. ","[6731, 'Tobii is the world leader in eye tracking technology. Founded in 2001, the company has built its reputation on providing millions of families with the tools it needs in order to better communicate. Eye tracking was born as a research tool, but soon exploded in the specialty market where users were able to communicate using our products (Watch Sebastian Story). Since then we have uncovered countless uses for this technology.The inspiration for Tobii Ghost came about whilst watching speech tablet users, We soon realized that we were trying to guess what they were trying to say just before they actually said it, giving us a visual representation of user intention.With this thought formed and being avid gamers ourselves, we began toying with the idea with the belief that this had great potential ONLY IF we were able to have a good visualization tool to display exactly where and what a person is looking at.Challenges we ran intoBack then we didn’t have a good visualization tool for eye movements on screen. However, there did exist a lot of experiments such as Dwell-Free that allowed us to trace a succession of actions based on heat maps. Whilst innovative, it wasn’t really suited to gaming. We needed something less intrusive and based on what we experienced, heatmaps were a step in the right direction in terms of achieving fluency.So, we accelerated the decay of the heatmap and that created a kind of a waterdrop effect in the screen (The first bubble!). We then created a different variation of that technique that ended up being the customization feature in our extension. After that things gathered steam. We showcased the functionality to Eleague and we were promoted in a  ""Getting Technical"" segment that became quite popular in the show. After that (by content creators/streamers request), we made this a streaming tool. Accomplishments that we are proud ofThe 2nd challenge came when we had the option to transform this streaming tool as an extension, by that time twitch was working in a new version of their extension store showcasing a new way of visualizing extensions in categories,  that will boost discovery for newcomers. Of course, we did not want to lose this opportunity, but we had 3 weeks to research how to build this and actually do it!Also, we have no branding at all, we call it internally the ""Gaze overlay"", so we had to have that in mind too and what was more difficult by then: ""How we can help our users to explain to their viewers that the bubble means eye tracking?"". It was a huge challenge, a very exciting one with a lot of office hour but also with a ton of fun since we were doing something that no one has seen before in gaming and/or eye tracking :) We have seen an amazing reception that been translated into a great exponential organic growth. This has not only allowed us to expand in streamers numbers but also has open doors in esports events as a broadcasting tool: Rainbow Six US Invitationals   ', 'Empowers the viewer with the ability to see where the streamer is looking in the screen. Watch Demo ', ""There are various components involved in transferring streamers gaze on their screen to a stream on Twitch. The easiest way is, of course, to burn the gaze bubble into the stream. However, this won't offer the best user experience for the stream viewers as they don't have any say in the whole setup.We started to develop the Twitch extension based on the Tobii streaming gaze application which we already had. It now needed to push the streamer's gaze data to the viewers, luckily Twitch's PubSub API fitted that purpose. From the viewers perspective, they would get streamers gaze data and could customize it according to their preferences or turn it off altogether.Tobii Ghost windows application passes the gaze point data to Twitch using products offered by Amazon Web Services, then Tobii Ghost extension on Twitch will receive the gaze point data and will try to visualize it with the help of WebGL.What we learnedThat eye tracking is a great addition to streaming for 3 main reasons:a) To allow viewers to understand the streamer decision-making process while they play. b) To allow viewers to see streamers reaction time, been able to measure Streamer eye-hand coordination with their own. c) An extra tool for educational streamers to showcase their game awareness and what they focus is in the different stages of the game. in addition, being able to have access to all the data that streamer generates with AWS has made us learn a lot about our users. What we initially thought was a great product for the battle royale and overall shooter genre, has given us an amazing response in some other communities. That has been the case with  OZU!, Tetris 99, Guitar Hero, Chess and Poker and IRL. We have also learned how to create a community out of this specific extension. What started as a support channel for new users, today is a place where streamers are constantly discovering new ways to use their eye tracker to connect deeply with their viewers. We are very aware that we have only just started and there is a long path to follow in terms of development, but for now, we have achieved great things and one of them is celebrating user content. We have done that not only by placing them into the spotlight.What's next for Tobii Ghost - Eye Tracking Twitch ExtensionThere is a lot cooking, so going forward we intend to make sure we continue the development of this tool by listening to our community feedback since we believe that user-centered design is the best way to explore the future of eye tracking in streaming.Based on that we are looking forward to working together with Twitch in order to fix time sync. Right now that is a process that needs to be done manually for every streamer. We believe that the outcome of this will be a big revolution since we will be able to provide the social aspect of eye tracking allowing viewers to make clips including Tobii Ghost.We are also looking forward to extending our experience to more devices, with mobile as a big target.Lastly to be able to give streamers way more control and data over how their viewers interact with the extension, so they can see what decisions boost engagement.Try it outgaming.tobii.com      Submitted to    Twitch AWS Extensions Challenge    Created by  Back-end DeveloperMohammad MousaviContent strategy, promo.

Of course, we did not want to lose this opportunity, but we had 3 weeks to research how to build this and actually do it!Also, we have no branding at all, we call it internally the ""Gaze overlay"", so we had to have that in mind too and what was more difficult by then: ""How we can help our users to explain to their viewers that the bubble means eye tracking?"". It was a huge challenge, a very exciting one with a lot of office hour but also with a ton of fun since we were doing something that no one has seen before in gaming and/or eye tracking :) We have seen an amazing reception that been translated into a great exponential organic growth. This has not only allowed us to expand in streamers numbers but also has open doors in esports events as a broadcasting tool: Rainbow Six US Invitationals  What it doesEmpowers the viewer with the ability to see where the streamer is looking in the screen. Watch DemoHow we built itThere are various components involved in transferring streamers gaze on their screen to a stream on Twitch. The easiest way is, of course, to burn the gaze bubble into the stream. However, this won\'t offer the best user experience for the stream viewers as they don\'t have any say in the whole setup.We started to develop the Twitch extension based on the Tobii streaming gaze application which we already had. It now needed to push the streamer\'s gaze data to the viewers, luckily Twitch\'s PubSub API fitted that purpose. From the viewers perspective, they would get streamers gaze data and could customize it according to their preferences or turn it off altogether.Tobii Ghost windows application passes the gaze point data to Twitch using products offered by Amazon Web Services, then Tobii Ghost extension on Twitch will receive the gaze point data and will try to visualize it with the help of WebGL.What we learnedThat eye tracking is a great addition to streaming for 3 main reasons:a) To allow viewers to understand the streamer decision-making process while they play. b) To allow viewers to see streamers reaction time, been able to measure Streamer eye-hand coordination with their own. c) An extra tool for educational streamers to showcase their game awareness and what they focus is in the different stages of the game. in addition, being able to have access to all the data that streamer generates with AWS has made us learn a lot about our users. What we initially thought was a great product for the battle royale and overall shooter genre, has given us an amazing response in some other communities. That has been the case with  OZU!, Tetris 99, Guitar Hero, Chess and Poker and IRL. We have also learned how to create a community out of this specific extension. What started as a support channel for new users, today is a place where streamers are constantly discovering new ways to use their eye tracker to connect deeply with their viewers. We are very aware that we have only just started and there is a long path to follow in terms of development, but for now, we have achieved great things and one of them is celebrating user content. We have done that not only by placing them into the spotlight.What\'s next for Tobii Ghost - Eye Tracking Twitch ExtensionThere is a lot cooking, so going forward we intend to make sure we continue the development of this tool by listening to our community feedback since we believe that user-centered design is the best way to explore the future of eye tracking in streaming.Based on that we are looking forward to working together with Twitch in order to fix time sync. Right now that is a process that needs to be done manually for every streamer.

"Stream Closed Captioner","Easily increase the accessibility of your stream by adding Closed Captioning for your viewers","[4703, 'I was first inspired to create a Twitch Extension like this when attending a panel by Suz Hinton (@noopkat) at Twitch Con 2017. She mentioned she was an advocate for accessibility on the web and wanted to try doing Closed Captioning on Twitch. This seeded the idea in my mind and I had it in the back of my head for a long time. Before the hackathon I started to notice broadcasters using a Closed Captioning browser source in their OBS setups, a simple section on their stream overlays dedicated to displaying speech to text closed captioning for their viewer. Seeing this rekindled the idea in the back of my mind and when the call went out for this hackathon I thought that the time was right to tackle trying to do the same but doing it as a Twitch extension video overlay that will be configurable and increase user engagement. ', 'Twitch extension video overlay that will display Closed Captioning to the viewer with the only requirement that the broadcaster uses a companion site to do the speech to text translation. All the broadcaster has to do is install the extension, enable it, login to stream-cc.gooseman.codes and click ""On"" when they go live. Once it\'s on viewers will see Closed Captioning being display on stream that they can hide or move around, with future features coming soon.  ', 'The extension front end was built using standard web UI technologies with ReactJS. The Companion site is a standard Ruby On Rails application hosted on Elastic Beanstalk. When a broadcaster signs in using a Chrome browser (Firefox support for Speech To Text is on the Mozilla roadmap) and they click ""On"". The browser will start listening to broadcasters mic and convert speech to text at near real time speeds. From there I send that information to the Server over a websocket when it passes though a simple profanity filter and then relays the payload to the broadcaster channel using the Twitch PubSub API endpoint. Now all viewers of the channel will receive the the Closed Captioning text to display. Since all viewers have a different latency to the broadcaster before displaying the text, I check the users HLS video latency and delay the display of the text for the amount of time. This helps to keep the text as in sync as possible with the broadcasters voice. ', 'One of the biggest challenges I encountered with solving the issue of the Closed Captioning being positioned in a location that was blocking a viewers experience. I grappled with a couple of ideas of having preset locations a broadcaster can set to position the CC where they would like it. But not all streams are created equal and having presets will not solve all peoples issues. I then realized, why not put it the power of the user to move the position of the CC text? So I added the ability to drag around the text on the viewer side so they can tailor the experience for themselves. This simple solution made me happy since now its in the power of the viewer on how they want to see the CC text. ', 'I am just proud I was able to build this extension using the APIs Twitch has offered. It works and it was fun building it. ', 'I learned a lot about AWS and deploying a Ruby on Rails application, I never actually built and deployed anything on my own. I also learned a lot more more about the Twitch Extension API and the data available through it. ', 'There are a lot of features I want to prototype and build for the extension.A couple ideas I like to prototype for broadcaster:Downloadable transcripts of their CC sessionEnable text translation for another language, ie. Korean language streamer enables translating text from Korean to English. A viewer will then be able to toggle betweenBroadcaster can customize the font used for the closed captioning textWhen a broadcaster says the name of an emote its could display the emote on screen or replace the text with the emoteVoice activated overlay eventsIdeas for the viewer experience side of the extension:Bit enabled actions/events with the textPay bits to cause the spoken text to rain down from the top of the screen and pile up for a period of timeStill thinking about other ideas that users can trigger with bits but not at the cost of ruining the closed captioning experience for others.

Alexa Skill that uses dynamic 3D.","[4376, 'A friend of mine told me about the Amazon Multimodal Contest, #AmazonAlexaMultimodalChallenge, and I thought I\'d take a stab at making my first Alexa Skill.  While researching the Amazon Presentation Language I looked for inspiration in my daily life to guide my direction.  One evening, my family and I were trying to decide on what movie we would watch.  This sparked the idea of a fun and interactive decision maker.  Thus was born, ""Fork On The Road"".  ', 'The skill is invoked with ""Alexa, ask Fork On The Road"".  Users are asked to add up to four things for the fork to choose from.  Users can also remove items they\'ve added.  While users are adding things, an animation of the fork bounces in the intersection of two roads.  A full 3D scene is used to present items in a fun and unique way, with items placed as dynamic 3D extruded text.  When there as at least 2 items the user can ""Spin the Fork"".  When the fork is choosing, it bounces up and spins around, slowly stopping on the path it would like you to take.  A final screen presents the forks decision using another dynamic 3D scene.  This skill works responsively across all Alexa products ranging from speech-only to TV.  ""Your destiny awaits.  Enjoy!"" ', 'This project was created using several different technologies.  It primarily uses open-source and Amazon platforms.  The key technology is Amazon\'s APL.  The APL is designed using several layers of APL Components, including APL Video, that are sequenced with SendEvent Commands and Document Directives.  Document transforms, game logic and speech response is managed using the ASK SDK for Node.js running on Lamba.  Skill configuration for invocations, utterances, intents, lambda, etc, are maintained and deployed through a Skill Manifest and the ASK CLI.  Resources and Assets come from two different sources.  Static files are hosted on S3 with a Cloudfront instance on top.  Dynamic assets, like the dynamically generated 3D scene, are requested from a Lambda service with API Gateway routing requests.  This dynamic asset service uses a Headless Chrome Node API called Puppeteer to load a website, take a screen capture, and send it back to the Alexa device with a ""image/png"" header.  The captured website uses Three.js to dynamically construct a scene based on the variables in the request and composes elements such as extruded text.  Animations were also scripted in Three.js and then captured, cropped and embedded in the APL. The 3D scene was first composed in Unity to get the look and feel correct and then exported.  Finally, the fork\'s sound effect was composed in Sony Acid Pro using a couple of layered sounds and exported to the appropriate MP3 specs using Audacity.Enlarge ImageEnlarge Image ', 'The Amazon APL is off to a great start but the games visual sequences will most likely be easier to accomplish once there are more APL Commands and Component options.

"Suju - suju.online","On demand self-driving buses using multi-parameter route optimizing aimed to help event and public transportation.","[5906, ""Our team members are hyped about Machine Learning and UX. We were intrigued by the Sohjoa virtual bus stops challenge. It allowed us to design a bus service we would love to use ourselves: a cheap but efficient alternative for the taxi/uber. We wanted to hack a bunch of state of the art tech together to show how a dynamic bus service could work.The problemEvent organizers have trouble getting their attendees to the event venue. Public transportation may not be enough and organizing custom transportation is expensive and time-consuming. The best practice for custom transportation so far is to organize a route from a pre-defined point X to the venue using a pre-defined schedule. The customers will still have to travel to point X before they can use the arranged transportation. They will have to schedule their day based on the transportation's schedule. If they don't want to deal with these problems they can choose to use their own car or get a taxi/UBER, which gets expensive really fast.  Technically, this kind of problem is often referred to as the last mile problem. We wanted to tackle a variation of this: the first mile problem. Even with just some tens of passengers there are millions of possible routes between them, let alone when a third variable, time, is taken into account.The solutionOur project for Junction 2016 aims to solve the transportation problem by using Sohjoa to organize dynamic and cost controlled custom transportation. Our concept is a tool for event organizers and public transportation decision makers that allows them to design dynamic routing for the self-driving bus. If the surroundings of a location are pre-scanned the bus can plan and drive routes that are planned on-the-go.  Our tool makes the required optimizations to the route, chooses a smart way to transport people from their desired pick-up location and tells Sohjoa which route and schedule to follow during the transportation. The use cases1) Event transportationEvents organize group transportation to boost visitor counts. Doing this in a cost efficient way is what really matters. Unlike public transportation there is a more clear business model: people bring in money, so it is worth investing money to bring them to the event. Our routing algorithm allows prioritization by cost, which means that people can be transported on a price per visitor basis.2) The commuter's first mileCurrently public transportation is organized around node points such as railway or metro stations. However, the last mile or so is often the most unconvinient for a commuter. Busses to less populated areas leave seldomly and can't stop at everyones home. Our service can create efficient routes that transport everyone from and to the general area of their home - adjusting dynamically to demand thus being able to take the shortest route to the destination.  The techThe service is running on a node.js server, with React and Redux used for the web UI. Our algorithms are written in Python so we can leverage state of the art Machine Learning libraries.1) Clustering user data  - Recursive DBSCAN machine learning algorithm to reduce the complexity of the spacetime data.2) Sjukstra routing  - Customized Djikstra that takes into account cost-factors that are specific to electric buses3) Routing with EMBERS  - Leveraging Embers route planning to get fast routes between virtual bus stops4) Data visualisation with leaflet  - Intuitive and easy to use planning and visualisation tool for virtual bus stops5) Telegram (SujuBot) end user demo  - Example of an end user UI. Helps envision how the service would look for an end user.  AccomplishmentsThe project required long hours and took our very best effort. In the end, even though at times we had problems and didn't always feel like we were progressing, we were able to create a prototype of a service that helps better imagine what is possible and how shared transportation could work. We have coded through the entire night and currently have our fingers crossed that our pitcher will stay awake through Sunday.Our main challenges were parametrizing and developing algorithms to solve the initial routing problem, we had to develop them almost from scratch. Integrating our different parts to a seamless and consistent service took lots of time and effort. Lastly, it was difficult to prioritize and scope a presentable MVP, the problem was complex and had numerous points of possible failure.What's nextOur project is left open ended. It could be taken towards multiple of development directions, but only time will tell. We hope that during the judging phase we will get inspiring suggestions or feedback on our project.Built Withazuredbscanemberses6leaflet.jsnode.jsnumpypostgresqlpythonradixreactreduxsassscikit-learntelegramTry it outsuju.onlinegithub.com      Submitted to    Junction 2016Winner                Main Prize              Winner                Embers Challenge              Winner                Sohjoa Robotbus Challenge              Winner                Track Finalists                  Created by  Deployed code to server, consulted algorithms and added very small touches on the frontend.Aleksi JokelaI developed some front endJere VaaraThe mom of the team.

Ready to go!Recognising someone and adding a their contacts is as easy as taking a picture of that person!Challenges we ran intoFace recognition doesn't really work well - different camera configurations, different lighting or even haircut and glasses screwed up the process. Thus, in the future, we need to add more reliable identification techniques like Fingerprint recognition (when the devices are equipped appropriately) with a fallback to techniques like NFC, Bluetooth or QR Code scanning.Having a centralised server for all the functionality means that we can roll out updates and have total control over the core of our app. However, it also means that the app can't function offline or if the server goes down. Meanwhile, doing Face recognition on the device is difficult due to all the SDKs out there (some of which are limited to the processor chips, e.g., Snapdragon SDK).Using Ionic and Cordova for making an app was a really good choice due to rapid view design process, but the framework sometimes behaves unexpectedly on the actual device. Lack of on-device JavaScript debugging makes development quite a horrifying process.Accomplishments that we're proud ofWe were advised to have a look at Parse backend-as-a-service and it worked out really great for us. Our backend server is just a single file with less than 250 lines of code!Doing a complex app that interacts with a server, uses camera and Face recognition only by means of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript is exciting and is quite an accomplishment on its own. A couple of years ago we never could imagine using thick technology stack in such a way!What we learnedWe had no prior experience in Ionic or Face recognition, so we learnt a great deal.

"Gradebook","Gradebook is a scalable, cross-platform information learning system analytics platform for high school students.","[6004, ""A business that makes nothing but money is a poor business.Henry FordWe weren't inspired by some life-changing experience, or by a vision to be the greatest in all of history.As students, we wanted more from our grade data. So we created the first solution.How it worksThe best way to experiment is through daily utility -- so that'sexactly how we've setup our first version.The first version of The Gradebook is built as an extension of the learning information platform Infinite Campus. In setting our application up this way, we can access existing student data, building up our platform on a system that our own school uses to store grade data.When a student signs into their school portal, we use the existing API to download all of their grade data, then we reorganize it in a way that makes it more visually pleasing, easier to understand, and more navigable.FunctionalityTheoretical Grading: Your grading platform should extend beyond the present -- we make that happen. With theoretical grading, you can add in future grades to see how it would affect your existing grade. Don't get blindsided by critical grade dumps that change your grade.Built-In Notifications: When you open the application, you're presented with any new updates to your grades. Click on any notification to immediately scroll to that class.Beautiful User Interface: Our user interface minimizes convolution while focusing on what matters most. The app is just a frame, your grades are the real content.Faster Refresh Rates: Because we solely focus on grades, we can grab your data faster. As soon as we have all of your raw grade data, we cut off the stream, minimizing data usage and maximizing download times. No extra student information is downloaded, giving us an edge over traditional platforms.Extreme Ubiquity: Our app is available on iOS and Android, with user interfaces specific to each platform. Download it at grdbk.comChallengesSince there aren't any other products in our market, we had to paveour own path.Information Learning SystemThe world of student gradebook data is a battle of the big companies: Powerschool, Infinite Campus, and many other solutions are going to head-to-head with claims over parts of the American education system. That level of fragmentation made it hard to determine where to start. Since our school,  Adlai E. Stevenson High School, uses Infinite Campus, we started with that.Initial RoleOur end goal is to provide broad-variety analytics to both students and teachers regarding overall trends in classes based on the teacher, the school, and pretty much any other possible filter. But that's a bit macroscopic -- so we started small.We decided to start off by just helping students make sense of where their grades are, and where they could be heading. Therefore we built a system that can grab student data and then provide theoretical grading.Student PrivacyStudent data has to be handled extremely responsibly, so we've done our best not to overstep. All data is solely stored locally and all calculations are done on the device in real-time. We want to shift over to a server (in beta), but we want more help and to invest more time into developing a secure server-client infrastructure first.Bug FixesWe have a small team of 3 active students, balancing our coding lives with all of our extracurriculars and academics. We often find ourselves staying up late trying to solve bugs only to find out there are more that have been discovered. Everyone is in extremely unique grading situations, and we often find ourselves tweaking our code to deal with unanticipated situations.DemographicsThough our market is the entire student population in America, we can't reach them all at once. For now, we've limited our marketing and setup to our school community: Adlai E. Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire, Illinois. We want to continue to expand outside of our community, and to move onto different information learning systems so we can access people who don't use Infinite Campus as well.AccomplishmentsCreated the first real student analytic platformCompleted our application & pushed it to the market in under 6 monthsFollowed up the iOS version with an Android version in under 3 monthsUsed by 50% of potential demographic (local school population of 4000+)News coverage in local school paper with interviewLessons LearnedBefore pushing to market, the beta process is extremely importantDesign the UI carefully, changing it radically post-release disturbs user comfortWhen someone asks for a feature, adding it makes them a loyal userConsistent updates keep users happyLoyal/happy users recommend your software to friendsUnorganized code inhibits code scalabilityUp NextThe Gradebook is still in its infancy.

As this is the Tornado season at Manhattan we decided to go ahead with the idea to create a weather Alert system using existing hardware and APIs.

Finally we decided to work on weather Alert system. After finalizing the design we decided to make a mobile application. It was getting difficult to decide platforms to work and therefore we came up with an idea of a web-based application.  We wrote the code on HTML and PHP and used LIFX and OpenWeatherMap APIs . We have implemented following functionalities.Switching Lights On/OffSetting lights to desired colors.Control brightness of the light.Implemented Special Effects - Pulse effectsWeather Alert - This is the most vital functionality. Using current user location (Longitude and Latitude ) we fetch data from OpenWeatherMap. This returns JSON data with different details about weather. There are three major categories of weather status returned - Clouds , Rain and Clear. When status is ""Rain"" we invoke a pulse notification with Blue color that notifies user of Rain. If the weather status is Clouds we give a mild purple color pulse. This indications help user to stay updated without looking at their digital devices. As this is a visual stimulus it quickly grabs user attention and saves them from missing any update (SMS or alarms can be overlooked if they are silent or in other rooms).

Learning anatomy is difficult as it usually costs significant time and effort to memorize and comprehend. Our MedReality website provides an impactful solution to increase lively study environment and promote students imagination in learning anatomy. MedReality is a virtual reality website providing students exclusive experiences including several vibrant and descriptive anatomical lessons in both human and animals. Our inspiration is to allow students to both train by themselves and in groups, as multiple users can join a virtual space and experience a human and animal anatomy demonstration.Additionally, this framework is deployed with an AI system which was trained on a cloud using human expert ground truth. The system's purpose is able to assist disease diagnosis,  medical imaging segmentation or even quantification. "", 'With the VR experience in MedReality, users may explore organs and systems in a fully immersive environment in virtual reality, display diseases in varying states of severity, and add treatments to visualize and understand medical options.Users can exploit brains, vessels, organs, bones, and muscles in order to explore anatomical structures in orthogonal views: coronal, sagital and axial. Moreover, with a richable amount of ex-vivo and clinical scan sources, MedReality promisingly encourages users to widely elaborate their learning knowledge and skills in respect to perceive a profound understanding of structures in respect to terminology and definitions. Our MedReality WebVR is an advanced learning tool that could help not only medical students but also individuals without a medical background to visualize and explore anatomy. In addition, MedReality also include an Artificial Intelligent which is trained using 3D deep neural network (3DUnet) to detect white matter, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid. This AI can be further extended to detect structures in other organs like heart, kidney, liver, etc. Furthermore, it will help to correct/guide students in learning these anatomical structures. On the other hand, this AI highly aims to 1) support students and researchers working in radiology and medical imaging to segment and quantify structure volume and 2) assist medical doctors to diagnose abnormal structures in human body such as tumors.

How?Office Floor Plan Navigator is built using an open source web based Geographic Information System (GIS) JavaScript framework. To retrieve data from Office 365, we use the Microsoft Graph API to pull user profile data including the thumbnail image. The Microsoft Graph API is called via PHP.  Assign a unique ID (add to any Azure AD field) to a desk, printer or meeting room, then, use Office Floor Plan Navigator to attach an XY coordinate to the ID.  Then, query the Azure AD for a person etc and Office Floor Plan Navigator will zoom to the corresponding XY location on the office floor plan and bring up their profile details.The custom SharePoint Employee Directory is built via ASP.net.  The embedded Office Floor Plan Navigator employs the use of a SharePoint web part and an iframe.Challenges?A couple of technical glitches were encountered when registering the application.  Permission to read user profiles did not appear to  be granted.  After much random clicking this was resolved.Also, one annoyance discovered was the lack of profile information integration between Azure AD,  Office 365 user manager, and SharePoint Online.

"Unofficial Devpost API","The unofficial part means I probably won't fix it when it breaks.","[3735, 'I was inspired by the innovative tools that I was learning about at the most recent AWS Summit here in New York (Checkout the presentations on SlideShare and Youtube if you haven\'t already.)I knew that I wanted to use AWS Lambda to run ""Event-Driven Code in the Cloud"" as they put it, and when they showed us how simple it was to create an HTTP endpoint for your Lambda functions the first thing that sprung to mind was a scraper that would take Devpost pages and return JSON.How it worksIt\'s a little quirky to work with since you\'ll need to make POST requests in order to retrieve your data as JSON, since the new API Gateway/Lambda combination doesn\'t seem to have anyway to support URL parameters yet. Here is the example CURL command I would execute to scrape my portfolio:$ curl -X POST -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d \'{""screen_name"":""MGerrior""}\' https://iii3mdppm7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/UserPortfolioEndpointObviously you will want to replace my screen name with your screen name to obtain data related to you. It\'s not built as a crawler yet, so it will only return information that is visible when you first view your portfolio on Devpost.The API uses Amazon\'s new API Gateway that provides built in caching and throttling out of the box. The API endpoint is the hooked up to a Lambda function that is executed when the request is received. The Lambda function then scrapes the page, formats it as a JSON response, and returns it to the API Gateway which subsequently returns it to you.Challenges I ran intoOne of the challenges that I ran into was finding resources for learning how to work with these tools. They\'re both fairly new services (API Gateway was just announced at the summit a week ago), so finding resources online outside of the official docs was not easy. I additionally ran into some issues with the Grunt tasks I was using from grunt-aws-lambda since it was producing empty zip files for me to upload to Lambda, but I eventually just zipped the files myself.Accomplishments that I\'m proud ofI\'m pretty proud that I was able to get this up and running in just a few hours as part of Dev Thursday here at Devpost.What I learnedI learned that I hate writing Java. As of right now AWS Lambda mainly supports two runtime environments which are node.js and Java. I couldn\'t figure out how to get NPM modules loaded in Lambda (Save yourself some time, just read this) so I decide I would just use Java instead and take advantage of all the built-in libraries, or so I thought. After struggling with Eclipse, and then struggling to install the AWS SDK for Eclipse (something something Data Tools Platform?), I switched back to node.js and bundled the npm modules as a ZIP file thanks to the guide above.What\'s next for Unofficial Devpost APII want to figure out how to add CORS headers to the responses from the API Gateway so that developers on Devpost can integrate this data into third party sites such as their portfolio by doing something as simple as:$.post(""https://iii3mdppm7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/UserPortfolioEndpoint"", {screen_name: ""MGerrior""}, function(data) {  // Add your projects to the DOM});If you try that right now the request will fail for security purposes since the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is not set in the response.Also, it wouldn\'t hurt for this to have more endpoints, or to just build an actual API for Devpost.Built Withamazon-web-servicesaws-api-gatewayaws-lambdacheerio.jsgrunt-aws-lambdagrunt.jshtmljavascriptnode.jsnpmrequest      Submitted to    Your First API | Summer Jam    Created by  Matthew GerriorSenior Software Engineer @ Devpost ', ' ', ' ', ""One of the challenges that I ran into was finding resources for learning how to work with these tools.

We all went to summer camp as kids, and Richard encouraged us to use that theme on the landing page and overall branding. Holly came up with the fabulous logo and color scheme, while Neal knocked out a basic landing page and steered the team towards the Jam / Jamboree language. Once we had a basic page, Holly went back and rewrote all of Neal's hacky CSS and created high-res assets mobile. Keeping it leanWe chose to keep the stack light, relying on only Pure, retina.js, and google fonts. No jQuery here.We also used deep-link.js to add a mobile-only What'sApp sharing link.

"BackPack","SAVE MORE ENJOY MORE","[2739, 'We all love money hacks. When it comes to renting a room during a visit to a place is a waste of money. We usually use a hotel room for refreshment and rest purpose which is fulfilled in at max 3-4 hours of stay. This waste our money as we have to pay for the whole day but there is solution for it. ', ""Backpack will maintain a dynamic record of hotel rooms. People here will be able to book rooms on basis of hour and they have to pay accordingly(not the whole price). Then can have there flexible schedule.How does it help out customer and hotelSuppose the rent of the hotel for $200 for a day. But if the person books through BACKPACK he has to pay as low as $40 as for 2 hours. The hotel will also gain profit because rooms are empty to book again. In this way on hotel end they can make more than $200 per day and at the customers end one has to pay a small sum.Revenue Generation For The CompanyAs per the scalability and different timings of year we would impose revenue from 3% to 12% of the total amount taken from our customers . A major share of revenue generation will be this and soon some pro features would be available which only people with our prime membership could access.How we will build itIt will be available on android ,web and iOS platforms .Team will consist 4 departments :-1 ) Collecting resources - arrangement of incubation center 2) Coding - skill developers working at both back end and front end3 ) Advertising - making contacts with the people and the hotel (very first will be bani park)4 ) Sales management - this team will keep an eye on market and accordingly changes the rent of roomsChallenges We ran intoThere are some loop holes like justifying the price of the hotel. Maintaining of hotel standards becomes difficult when there is checkout every 2 to 3 hours. It can create a whole lot of trouble to those hotels which have a large number of rooms. And at the same time dynamic data analysing is the soul of the backend of Backpack.Accomplishments that We are proud ofWe think this idea can break the pre-existing idea of 12-12 and also can be a good competitor of OYO like companies in coming days.What We learnedOverall it is good experience of finally seeing the idea come into reality.

"WiSign","WiSign is an ios app designed for people to learn fingerspelling in American Sign Language. We want to provide people with chances for communicating and understanding Deaf community with its culture.","[7540, ""Siyuan: Being a person who identified as a Hard of Hearing student in UW-Madison, I was aware that many people did have stereotypes against Deaf or Hard of Hearing(DHOH) people. Many people consider the DHOH community as an isolated community and they hope DHOH people could communicate with hearing people by spoke language. However, in Deaf culture, many DHOH people really enjoy communicating with others and they love to use American Sign Language (ASL) to engage in communication. Therefore, I want to use a mobile app to help people who are interested in ASL to improve their fingerspelling skills.Harry: As a person grow up with a cochlear implant, I can feel the world with sound or not. It's a very special experience and I want people to learn more about this special group. A mobile app would be a perfect platform to learn some interesting facts about the deafness, so I took Siyuan's invitation immediately when she asked me to join.Yuren: Actually, I did not meet many DHOH people before I came to Madison for undergraduate study. After I came here, I met and made friends with different people within the DHOH community. The more I get in touch with this community, the more I want to learn about it. Therefore, when Siyuan asked me whether I wanted to join her for this project, I joined without hesitation. "", 'WiSign is divided into two main functions, Quiz and StudyQuizThis function test how the user learns the fingerspelling in ASL. We fulfill this aim by testing how users identify different words by fingerspelling, combinations of signed alphabets, in different length-of-word ranges and send the words they inaccurately identify to review words list. Users can choose one of the four modes: easy, normal, hard, and evil, which contains words with length less than 3 characters, 4 - 6 characters, 7 - 8 characters, and equal or over 9 characters, separately.Our word list is generated from dictionaries in the Github repository and can be found from https://github.com/stoneotaku/vobmaster.git. We developed a python program to filter all the words in the word lists to the length corresponding to the 4 modes.Every word is shown to the users by images of ASL alphabet signs corresponding to characters in the words. The duration of each image is 0.5 seconds.We check how the user learns the fingerspelling in ASL by asking them to type the words they see and check whether they identify each sign accurately. The test input is not case sensitive. If the user enters the correct answer, the app will swift to the next question automatically. Otherwise, the current question will be added to the review words list and the images will be displayed again for users. The users can also put the current question directly to the review words list and see the answer directly. Users can take as many quizzes as they want.StudyThe study section has two parts, Study A - Z and Review.Study A - Z  part is designed for new ASL learners. They can view all the characters in alphabet order individually.Review part is designed for users to go over words they identified inaccurately or put into review words list during the quizzes. In this part, the images of signs are displayed the same as that in the quiz. However, users are not required to enter the words; instead, they can click the button to see answers directly. Besides, they can choose to remove the words from the review words list if they believe they master this combination of signs. After the user clicks the remove button, the button will change to the button for putting the words back if users remove them mistakenly. ', 'We used Github to work as a team and achieve the goal of version control. Each one of us has a task: Siyuan is responsible for UI of the app, Yuren is responsible for the icon design, string generator and image player, Harry is responsible for icon design, link images to string and view management. We started with simple tasks and tried to add features to our app after debugging the basic version. We always make a plot graph before moving on the next objective. Therefore, we communicate effectively and maximized our learning experience in 24 hours. ', ""We had a lot trouble with Github at first. Sometimes Github can't resolve the conflicts when two person modified same file at the same time . We solved the problem by always asking other teammates what changes they have made before update their own versions to GitHub.It's our first time to program in Swift, so we had to learn everything from scratch and develop this program in 24 hours. We had a lot of difficult times trying to create objects, connecting code with UI design, and switching from different view controller to maintain a good functionalities for our app. "", 'We are totally new to Swift and iOS app development and we developed the app by ourselves in only 24 hours. Also, we designed fantastic icons for our app in representing love and badger pride. ', 'Swift, UI Design, UIKit ', ""The current image speed is set to 0.5 seconds, we hope to update the setting and enable users to set the different speed according to their ability with fingerspelling in ASL.The current UI is only compatible with iPhone XR. We hope to improve the UI and adapt it to all the currently available devices.We believe that daily practice is important than Setting daily goals for the user based on their quiz results. We want to include motivations for users to do so. To do so, we may add sections such as daily challenges, rankings, and archives. We believe it is also of great importance for users to use the actual signs in ASL in addition to identifying longer phase and sentence. Therefore, we hope to use a large number of videos to train models to recognize fingers' and palms' movements by users. In this way, we are able to test whether users can use the actual signs in ASL corresponding to the phrases or even sentences.We want to help connect and enlarge the Deaf Community as well as spreading its culture. We hope to build an online cloud community within WiSign so that ASL users and learners across the world can get in touch with each other better.

"melon","Can't pick the ripest watermelon without splitting it open? Fear not! ""melon"" uses a neural network to predict the quality of watermelons through data collected by sound sensor and impulse deliverer.","[3705, ""We knew from the offset that we wanted to do a hardware-based hack. We began with the several sensors available to us that could interface with the Qualcomm Dragonboard. Of particular interest were vibrational sensors. After considering our options, we settled on using a sound sensor to deduce structural integrity and composition of materials. We decided that a great way to test this technique would be with watermelons. After finding a 2004 paper that empirically demonstrated a relationship between vibrational modes and watermelon quality, we realized that this project would be feasible. While the authors of the paper conducted acoustical analyses, we decided, based on the time available to us and because we felt it was more aligned with the spirit of HackTJ, to use a neural network to differentiate watermelon quality. What It DoesWe prototyped a portable watermelon quality sensing device that delivers a sound producing impulse through a servo and records the corresponding sound. The recorded sound is fed into a trained neural network that determines whether or not the sound corresponds to a higher quality watermelon.How We Built ItFirst, we opened Qualcomm and tried to boot it up. After figuring out how to use the DragonBoard, we began researching how to use the electrical components while also making the neural network. While this was happening, we also brainstormed a procedure to gather data and prototyped an arm that would be attached to the servo, which we later 3D printed. Initially, we used a spy camera and microphone, but because it didn’t work, we switched to using a webcam. Afterward, we collected data using the sensor, fed the data into the neural network to train it, and wired up the actual apparatus.Challenges and AccomplishmentsThe microphone that came with spy camera did not function correctly; the signal obtained from the microphone was not clean, as a result, the .wav file was full of beeping noises that rendered data uselessThe 96Boards that came with Qualcomm DragonBoard was causing kernel panics on the DragonBoard; we solved this by giving the 96boards an additional USB power supplyWanted to do a project on watermelons; did not have watermelons; solved by getting watermelons3D printed arm did not fit onto servo, filed down components so that they fitOvercoming hardware issues by employing gracious professionalism among peers: borrowed camera due to nonfunctional cameraNeural network arrays did not align up: kept fiddling till workedSuccessfully collected dataArtificially created a controlled simulation for bad watermelonServo was not strong enough so we used knuckles to apply consistent sound generating impulse to the watermelonCame up with a fun and challenging project ideaWhat We LearnedHardware problems that can’t be fixedGathering and processing audio data from microphonesLearned that python code can be super annoyingUsing GitHub, transferring dataDifficult to roll watermelonsLearning how to use Qualcomm boardLibrary-specific sensors to DragonBoardImportant to be patient when debuggingWhat's Next For IoT HackTJ ProjectUpgrading hammer/servoA more comprehensive training setExpanding fruit typeCreating a more portable deviceBuilt With3d-printer5inch-hdmi-displayarduinoautodesk-fusion-360c++kuman-ky61-micro-servologitech-c920-webcam/microphonepythonqualcom-dragonboard      Submitted to    Hack TJ 6.0Winner                Best Hardware or Other Hack                  Created by  Sophia Wangrichardwang1124Jude_underscore_BShasty88 "", ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['python', 'qualcom-dragonboard', 'logitech-c920-webcam/microphone', '5inch-hdmi-display', 'kuman-ky61-micro-servo', 'c++', 'arduino', 'autodesk-fusion-360', '3d-printer']","False","27","['sophiawang310', 'richardwang1124', 'jude_underscore_b', 'shasty88']","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/795/011/datas/small.jpg","False","0"

"Sobr","A keyless solution to prevent drunk driving","[8081, ""Sobr was inspired by the large amount of drunk driving accidents in the U.S. In 2017, there were 10,874 deaths due to drunk driving. Sobr aims to reduce this number by preventing intoxicated drivers from stepping behind the wheel to begin with and providing alternative methods of arriving home.What it Does?Sobr is intended to be an accompanying application for drivers to identify whether or not they are intoxicated before driving. It uses a combination of features detected through facial recognition to unlock the car, as long as the driver is classified as sober. If the driver is classified as intoxicated, a second (different) face must be provided to act as a designated driver.How We Built It?We began by scraping data off a dataset of pictures of human subjects before and after they had consumed alcohol. It was rather difficult to find quality datasets of this nature, and so, we had to make do with a small initial sample.Preprocessing DataWith small sample pool of images collected from 53 participants, we are asked to expand the datasets to avoid underfitting the data. First, we train a Haar Cascade Classifier to detect and extract facial features from the images. From there, we turned to image augmentation for machine learning experiments, based on which we write a script to arbitrarily apply 0, 1, or 2 special effects to the original 212 images. This technique of image augmentation allows us to generate a sample pool of 50,000, equally split between positive and negative samples.Research ProblemWe treat this as a binary classification problem where we identify whether or not the subject in the image is inebriated. We use iOS’s Vision API to detect the most prominent face in the input image, crop the corresponding bounding box, and feed this as the input to all our trained ML models.Prediction SystemThe first half of our prediction architecture is an ensemble of deep convolutional neural networks trained on different randomly sampled subsets of the augmented dataset. We observed experimentally that using an ensemble produced a much more robust and reliable result as compared to what we obtained with a single neural network. Every neural net in the ensemble had the same architecture: We have four convolutional layers that use a 3x3 kernel, each followed by a max-pooling layer that subsamples in a 2x2 area with a 2x2 stride. We use relu activations throughout the network and a softmax activation on the last layer. We used cross entropy loss along with stochastic gradient descent to find optimal weights for the neural network. We used high-memory instances from Google Cloud Platform to train our models since we required significant amounts of RAM to do so. After training, we used CoreML’s keras-to-CoreML converter to transform our model to a format that can directly run on an iOS device.Following through with our intention to build a voting classifier out of several different models, we built a classifier out of Microsoft Cognitive Services’ Custom Vision API on the augmented image dataset. We used the General(Compact) model type and used a probability cutoff that resulted in reasonable precision and recall values.Aggregated ClassifiersWe took a simple majority vote out of all the different classifiers that we use. Because this is a binary classification problem and because we intentionally used an odd number of classifiers, there is no possibility of a tie. The input image is classified to contain an inebriated subject(or not) based upon whichever class secures the majority vote.Challenges We Ran IntoWhen augmenting our dataset, we took a single image that contained four separate images and split the image into four separate images. For each image, two of the images were classified as sober and two were classified as drunk. When doing this, two of the images were mixed, causing our data to be skewed when training our models. The odd thing was that it performed better with the incorrectly labelled data.Accomplishments That We're Proud OfSobr was able to correctly classify intoxicated faces at 90.68% on the validation set. We do not at present have a mechanism to measure the App’s performance, but it still performed relatively well in our subjective evaluation. Also, we were able to connect to the SmartCar API in order to send commands back and forth.Our dataset contained just 212 images in total and we successfully trained a deep neural network that performs well on such a small dataset.DNNs are notorious for overfitting in the presence of small datasets and we overcame this problem through rigorous data augmentation and ensembling several models.We also achieved excellent performance on a challenging deep learning task that has not been explored at all by the community in less than 24 hours.We built a complete, end-to-end iOS application that utilizes the ML models that we built.What We've LearnedFrom the perspective of data engineering, we practiced expanding the sample pool with limited amount of public data available. In terms of data science, we obtained experience manually constructing comprehensive dataset from scratch and came to realize the precious value behind such establishment of such enormous datasets. Lastly, it was fascinating to become aware of how computer science can contribute to novelizing a traditional concept from the past to enable for infinite potential and efficacy well beyond the status quo.What's Next for SobrFor the next steps we would like to refine the model in order to provide more accurate results. Along with this, we would like to add more components to the entire system. For example, a camera could be added to the dashboard to insure that the driver of the vehicle is not intoxicated.ReferencesHermosilla, Gabriel, et al. “Face Recognition and Drunk Classification Using Infrared Face Images.” Journal of Sensors, 2018, doi:10.1155/2018/5813514.Koukiou, G., and V.

Not long ago I met the operations director for lean manufacturer that does contract work.  When I asked him his challenges he told me there were three.  First, he told me when they reconfigure the operations floor to transition from one work order to the next, usually it impacts any number of workstations, work-centers, machines, conveyors and/or robots, etc.. Sometimes, people and/or machines aren’t always available due to the existing work orders, so they need alternative configuration plans as well. They want a tool that allows them to virtually reconfigure the operations floor for a new work order as well as any alternatives before making the physical changes.Second,  they want to simulate the work order operations (and alternative configuration plans) to forecast a new work order completion date and time.Third, they want a tool that lets them virtually configure and simulate the manufacturing operations when they add or change out equipment, alter operations or come up with new ideas to try. When we learned about the Brilliant Manufacturing Suite, we were ecstatic!  This suite gives us exactly what we need to build a solution that helps this lean manufacturer and others quickly and easily respond to dynamic operational changes virtually. Hence PROS.  ', 'PROS provides operations floor engineers the ability to:Reconfigure and simulate operations virtually in 3D for work orders and the transitions between work orders,View Efficiency Analyzer information associated with the work order operations, Forecast the completion date and time for a work order given the current operations configuration, andRun simulations for what-if scenarios. ', 'PROS was built with the gaming platform Unity as it provides the ability to render and simulate work order operations in an immersive 3D environment. Using this platform will enable us to port this application to other platforms (i.e., browser, mobile, etc.) or run in Virtual and/or Augmented Reality. ', ""Working with new technologies always seems to present challenges.  I can't think of anything we did that didn't have some challenge associated to it.  Some of the more relevant challenges include understanding the API content, integrating with the APIs, figuring out how to associate and integrate API information with a 3D simulation and building the runtime editing capability for the 3D configuration. "", ""I'm proud to have taken an idea from inception to a developed solution leveraging virtual 3D technologies, which was fun in itself, but which also has the additional value of advancing the digital transformation currently underway in manufacturing. It's exciting knowing that this application is a step towards solving challenges in manufacturing today. I'm looking forward to where it is going to take me! "", 'When I started this project I thought I would have an application that was complete. During the process of developing the application I realized that even though the original scope was fundamentally complete, the potential for what this application could be and do is just in the early stages and far from being complete.   ', ""We are currently planning to:1) Better understanding of manufacturing requirements - I came up with the idea for this application after speaking with the operations director for lean manufacturer that does contract work. Before moving forward I want to better understand the needs of a variety of manufacturers in order to make this application significantly more meaningful as part of the digital transformation underway.2) Enhance existing functionality and capability - The current scope of this application is a bit limited.  After I better understand the manufacturing requirements above, I plan to vet potential enhancement ideas with various manufacturers to determine what functionality and capabilities would provide the best value to them. Additionally, we plan to address API endpoint integration performance which were not implemented due to the short timeframe of the project.3) Identify best platform for ease of use - Currently our application runs on PC, Mac and Linux standalones. Since we are using Unity we know we can build this application on selected browsers; Android and iOS devices; and in VR and AR. Again, before moving forward I'd like to better understand from manufacturers what makes the most sense for them.4) Incorporate analytical tools - Running a simulation requires data from the WiP and EA APIs in addition to the locational and animation data used to build the 3D scene.  Having this data available lends itself to incorporating analytical tools to optimize the operations which might include machine learning, linear programming, neural networks or other relevant tools.

Years ago, I was one of the first migrated customers. There was no dedicated iPhone app, so I made one which reads the voicemail system, stores the messages on the phone and can play them. The login is stored in the app. So when I got the Echo and there was no skill it was natural to port my app as a skill to my echo. ', 'The skill first needs an account link (login data for the ip voice mail system). Then it can query the number of messages (status), give information about a single specific message and can even play the recorded voice.

The skill script gets the authentication token from Alexa, generates the search id to look up the login data from the database and uses the authentication token to decrypt the login credentials. Then it can query the voicemail system. The voicemessage is provided by a third script as MP3 to the audio player. This script shares the server session with the skill script.

"Kinetica","Kinetica is an IoT device that creates a cost effective channel of communication for motor neurone disease patients.","[6611, ""2 months ago, my dad's former boss - Mr.Mittal -  came to Bangkok, Thailand for medical treatment. I soon found out that he suffered from motor neurone disease - a mild case of ALS specifically. I was awestruck by his condition. Just 20 years ago he ran large textile factories in Nairobi, Kenya alongside Indian businessmen. One morning, he and his wife came over to our house for breakfast. I witnessed the amount of assistance he required from his wife in order to perform basic tasks such as getting up, eating, drinking water, and even using the restroom. A few hours later, his wife decided to go to the market with my mother, leaving me alone with Mr.Mittal. Though he was able to partially move his hands and speak, most of the words came out to be gibberish. He was asking for something but I couldn't understand him. I wasn't able to ask his wife either because she would also have to guess and check what he wanted through the cell phone. After a few minutes of guessing, I finally brought him what he desired - a mere glass of water. Despite his medical condition, I was the one that felt disabled. I felt incompetent and powerless. At that moment, I realized that this was a problem worth tackling. Bridging the gap between ALS patients and their care takers was a paramount issue. I soon contacted my tech buddy - Mantej, who is extremely interested in studying biology and robotics - and decided to fix this problem!  "", 'The device is really quite simple. An ALS patient rests the arduino board on their hand. Whenever they touch a certain part of the device, the accelerometer is activated. They then move their hands in specified directions depending on what they need. As an example, if they move their hand a little to the right, our program translates that to wanting water. This data is then uploaded online for the caretaker of the patient to see (so they know exactly what their patient needs). The device uses a photoresistor to activate the accelerometer. Once the accelerometer is activated, it records the (x,y,z) coordinates. It then waits for an additional 6 seconds and remeasures the (x,y,z) coordinates. It calculates the delta difference between the respective coordinates (x2-x1, y2-y1, z2-z1) and checks for differences. All this data is sent to python scripts that analyze the motion. The delta values are then conditionally matched to some pre-defined gestures. From there, the gestures are printed online to a website. This allows both the person at the location to know exactly what the patient needs and for one that is in a remote place (ex. the wife of Mr.Mittal who was at the market). ', ""The device consists of 2 parts - hardware and software. For the hardware, we wired up an Arduino 101 with a basic breadboard, which consisted of a photo resistor, a 10k ohm resistor, and an accelerometer (adxl345). Whenever the patient would cover the photo resistor its voltage would change and send the data to the serial monitor. Whenever a change in the voltage was detected (below 850 in the case of the photo resistor), the accelerometer within the arduino was triggered. For the software side, the arduino would run a simple .ino file and receive the (x,y,z) coordinates. It would then wait for 6 seconds and then remeasure the (x,y,z) coordinates. This data was all sent to the serial monitor. From here, a python script using the serial library would use a baud rate of 9600 to connect to the serial monitor. It would save the data points in an array (of size 7, because 2 sets of (x,y,z) coordinates) and transfer this data into a .txt file (called 'output.txt' in this case). From here, it would also automatically run another python script that would analyze the delta change in the coordinates (see above) and based upon the changes form the closest gesture/desire. This gesture/desire would then be printed onto another .txt file (called 'input.txt' in this case). From here, PHP code was called that would transfer the .txt data to static web page. This was then modified a little bit using HTML5. The patient's desire was then printed to this web page and would be available for a person to view from anywhere (our's is limited to localhost for the demo).  "", 'Some of the challenges we ran into included: patient research, gesture movement accuracy, and connecting scripts. Motor neurone disease is a rare disease and has multiple different forms (ALS being one of them). Each patient can suffer varying degrees of this disease and would thus be able to use their hands in varying amounts. We had to set a standard amount they would be able to move their hand muscles. We also had to understand how to translate simple hand movements into desires/needs of the patients. We boiled them down to the bare basics to keep it simple: food, water, and restroom. Different movements would belong in one of the categories (we certainly plan on adding more when we receive more data). Perhaps one of the hardest challenges we ran into was connecting Arduino, Python, and PHP scripts into a single project.

"ECONDITIONER","We want to save water in California and built a smart air conditioning system that produces water.","[6740, 'Check out our Prezi hereWe used the Artik 10 Kit for this project.A lot of us have looked at various ways to save and conserve water. We, Team WPI decided to look at an option we believe is not fully utilized and is a source of water on a daily basis. The source, Air Conditioning. Each air conditioner has a runaway water pipe attached to it. This pipe essentially drains water formed by the condensation process inside the AC. Team WPI has come up with a way to harvest this water.We decided to focus on how each individual can contribute to this mission. This is because a 1.5 AC generates 0.3 gallons per hour while a 5 Ton Central AC generates 1 gallon per hour. Considering an average run time of 9 hours per day, a window AC generates 2.7 gallons each day while a Central AC generates 9 gallons a day!This trend has resulted in almost 87% homes with some sort of Air Conditioning equipment.  AC has virtually become a standard equipment of every household. Among 50 states in USA, California alone accounts for a massive 7.3% of air conditioning. A figure which is 5 times for than most states. This is because of the climate in California. California belongs to the region with hot/mixed dry climate type. With an average summer temperature of 90F and a year round temperature of around 80F, the high use of AC in California is justified.Let’s take a look at how this is a viable solution across the world. In 2013, a rough estimate of AC sales are approx. 900 million. A high volume of which are central ACs and rooftops AC. Together if we can implement E-Conditioner, we can save a lot of water and this in-turn will result more water available from traditional sources like dams and supply. ', 'We built and smart AC system that also saves water, as you can see in the video we can save up to 9 gallons of water a day. Even more if we optimize our condensation process. We use ARTIK10 to connect an standard air conditioning system with our own secure servers (try it on econtioner.me) via an MQTT protocol, we process information as temperature, humidity and most important the amount of water we save and its purity. We also add extra features to your standar AC system, you can program patters into the Econditioner, so that you also save energy. It learns from your ussage and can send you alerts if you are out of your house and left it on.A global solution ', 'We use ARTIK10 as the main processor in our Artik System, we integrated it to the air conditioning control board (got as much info as we could, but this is an ongoing process) to capture some data like temperature, we also incorporated sensors of our own. We then push this data to our server, that has a webpage on http://econditioner.me/ , using the MQTT protocol that is pretty common for IoT applications we get and receive data from our secure server. We can get useful information as temperature, humidity, water saved and the purity of the water and can send from our server to our Econditioner information about turn on and off signals and many features we are currently implementing (You AC unit would be able to turn itself on 30 minutes before you arrive home to greet you with a nice weather). ', ""There were many challenges we ran into, finding an air conditioning system that meets the needs for this project was one of them, we looked around standard AC units but some of them didn't fit our needs, we kind of used and old one at the end, but are looking to implement the Econditioner with a custom one, so that we can have an smart AC from start.It was also hard to use our own servers, planning databases, mqtt brokers and others was a challenge that we overcame at last, and of course keep improving the platform so that we can make Econditioner the new smart AC in your house.At last the final challenge was to save as much water as possible. We keep on working on improving the condensation progress of Econditioner so that we can save more water, trying to optimize this task to a limit is hard, but we are up for the challenge. "", 'We made one of the very first smart AC units. A user can manipulate and get feedback from his/her AC system from a computer, a tablet of a phone, you can turn it on and off wherever you are and also help solve the water crisis.We build a prototype platform for it, and a prototype product.The amount of water we can save is considerable looking at our numbers. ', ""From Cad Design, rendering, mqtt, to the more chemical part of this process, things like how water purification works, water condensation, optimized processes to obtain water from humidity. We also learn A LOT about California's use in air conditioning, we went to tons of data to make sure this project is feasible.  "", 'There are many more things to do, we want to optimize the water saving process to a maximum, having the best performance possible with minimal energy consumption. We would like to collect water from the fog too. Fog in an important resource of water that is found on the air, using it with Econditioner would be a feature that would make it even more attractive to the public.Optimize the platform and in the future launch a mobile app (It is currently a web app). Also add more features as intelligent control (the one we are currently working on)The sky is the limit, we look forward to keep on working hard to improve Econditioner.

"Stranded in the Expanse","Stranded in the Expanse is a sci-fi game that encourages fitness. You earn energy credits in the game by exercising!","[6930, ""I have always loved the sci-fi genre and games. One other thing I enjoy is running and going for long walks out in nature. Recently, my wife and I both got Fitbit trackers to help encourage our walking and fitness routine. We found using them to compete for the 'highest' number of steps each day to be quite addictive and fun.When I stumbled upon this hackathon, I was researching Docker containers and Kubernetes for work related purposes. I thought to myself: why not combine the already addictive Fitbit experience of competing for steps and walking, with a fun sci-fi adventure game, and use an online service running on Openshift to enable Fitbit to talk to the game on player's devices?This would provide people with a mobile game that is not only fun to play, but also motivational in terms of exercise and fitness.In addition to that, I could make the game experience even more fun/competitive by adding online leaderboards to the platform running on top of Openshift.Thus, Stranded in the Expanse was born! "", ""Stranded in the Expanse is sci-fi, action adventure experience that gamifies fitness. You use your Fitbit tracker device to help you progress in the game. The game encourages health and physical activity by giving the player in-game credit that they can use to upgrade their player's ship, in reward for steps counted on their Fitbit tracker. The online platform that makes this all possible runs on top of OpenShift's online platform.Players download the app from Google Play, install it, run it, and hit the register button to register a free account.They then do a 'once-off' hook up of their Fitbit account, to their Stranded in the Expanse account and perform an update of their Fitbit stats at least once a day.They login to the game using their registered details whenever they wish to play, and the game automatically converts any steps they have completed on Fitbit into 'energy credits' in the game, which they can use to upgrade their player's ship, and improve it.The aim of the game is to re-fuel your stranded ship by harvesting energy crystals in space. Once the player has harvested the required amount, they are able to play the end-game sequence and return home.Whenever the player wants more / better upgrades for their ship, the incentive is there for them to go out and walk/run with their Fitbit device! "", ""I started off using the MongoDB/Node.js template on Openshift. I spent quite a long time messing around with this and learning about how it worked, and how the network link between the containers was created. I also learned how the Openshift online platform worked, and how webhooks worked.Once I had all of this figured out, I deleted my sample / test project, and started fresh.I developed a very basic game menu and simple game prototype that just had a flying ship in Unity3D and got that up and running.Next, I developed a base node.js solution that was able to read from and insert values into my mongoDB instance. This part took quite a bit of skilling up, and I spent a significant amount of time learning about node.js and mongoDB here.Never-the-less, I found myself making good progress and just kept iterating on the game client and the online platform, adding an API manager to the game that was able to talk to my Node.js API. I built-in a way for the platform to register and login users, and authenticate them when API calls were made from the game. I plumbed in methods for the platform to talk to the Fitbit API and store any synchronized fitbit data for the player's on their accounts. I then built a way for the platform to communicate this to the game client.Once the core mechanic was in place, I began resolving all the game's logic. This includes things such as: player control and input, enemy spawning patterns / behaviors, attacks, player weapons, as well as the movement of random space objects and mining mechanics to collect space crystal with the mining laser.From there I added live leaderboards (total fitbit steps) for players to compete on and a way for the game platform's API to work with these, and added a message of the day service too. The leaderboards can be viewed online on the site, as well as through the game client. "", ""MongoDB and Node.js! I needed to learn a fair bit here. I now know what Node.js developers mean when they talk about 'callback hell'.I also ran into some challenges getting my game client to operate smoothly when making web requests to my node.js web API. I needed to figure out how to get these calls onto background threads, which is traditionally quite difficult to achieve with the Unity3D engine. I did manage this in the end though, and web requests now play out smoothly on background worker threads and don't lock up the UI. "", ""Completing a full solution from the back-end server in Node.js, and mongoDB database, to a custom middleware game API in Node.js to a full featured, fun client-side game on user's device. I'm really proud I managed to complete this full solution considering I've only had late nights and weekends to work on it around my full-time job and commitments as husband and father.Having a game released into the wild that is free, and that encourages fitness. "", ""I learned a lot about Openshift's platform, and the benefits it brings to the table. In terms of both easing workflows, and not having to manage Dockerfiles and complicated container networking.I also learned a lot about Node.js and MongoDB. "", 'I would definitely like to take this further. I think it is very unique (gaming and fitness!) and has great potential to go further.I would like to integrate with other fitness trackers next - like the Jawbone for example.After that I would like to spend more time on the gameplay and storyline of the gameplay.Then, I would like to add more online platform related features like daily challenges for extra rewards etc...

In addition, visionOS makes it possible to include third party API's into the app like Deezer, Snapchat or Swarm.All uploaded ads to the JCDecaux content server are then uploaded to the bus stations running visionOS. Ads have metadata configured before it is uploaded to the JCDecaux CMS. The data defines to which stations it must be sent (Finland, Sweden, France, Germany … maybe all. It is possible to configure targeting on the per-station basis). Vision OS runs the ads one by one and checks two conditions (questions).Should the ad be shown at this moment of time?What is the money proposal for being shown?The add to be shown is analysing the environment by using visionOS sensors API. The criteria includes: Location and recent news (near a conference?) -----> show a car adWeather ---> raining ? -----> show umbrellasBuses are late? ----->  Show a car ad if people are at the stopAnd any other criterias, the advertiser wants to consider. Apps have full access to the Internet and can evaluate any condition to get their value proposition right. The content and the way how IOT and third party API's are used are up to developer what generates a great space for creativity. "", 'We built visionOS with the help of Unity technologies and prototyping tools like Sketch. Along with the project we created the sample use cases for engaging ad campaign.

Using image recognition, Kenko allows you to track your daily intake of various nutrients including calories, sodium, cholesterol, etc. The application also has Apple Health Kit integration, allowing the app to store your health info in a centralized location. In addition, when you scan a food item, you also have the option of ordering more of that food item from a local restaurant. ', ""The main iOS app frontend is built in Objective-C, and the backend is written in Node.js. We realized very early on, after several attempts, that writing our own image classifier to recognize a variety of foods would be too expensive in terms of time and computational power. Instead, we decided to use the CloudSight API to help make this process a lot easier. We then used the context provided by the CloudSight API, and used the Nutritionix API to grab information about the food's nutrition data. The architecture of the app is very simple. The user takes a picture of some food with the iPhone app, which then sends a POST request to our Node.js backend (running on a Microsoft Azure VM). The Node.js backend then handles all of the communication with the various image recognition APIs and nutrition APIs. In addition, the backend also manages all user data and stores all past queries locally. The backend also aids the iPhone app in processing nutrition requests in the background, by allowing the iPhone app to send multiple images, and then receive the nutrition data the next time the user opens the up. "", ""We originally started by trying to write our own classifier using OpenCV. As we mentioned earlier, we realized very early on that building and training an image classifier that would identify various foods would be too difficult, time consuming, and computational expensive, as there was simply too large of a training data set to be processed and evaluated. As a result, we decided that using the CloudSight API would make our lives much simpler. We used the CloudSight API's Visual Search APIs to get context about food-related images and then later grab nutritional data. In addition, we also ran into latency issues with the CloudSight API, as the image recognition was a long, expensive process. We realized that part of the reason why the process was taking so long was because the images that were being sent by the iPhone app were very high-resolution, and also very large. We learned that bringing the resolution down brought the size of the image down significantly, and as a result we were able to get the CloudSight classifier to speed up a slight amount. The latency issues became less of a problem when we decided to change the intent of the classifier, being that the classifier would look for the main object within the image (in this case, the food), and not try and analyze all details of the entire image (e.g. the classifier would recognize additional, unnecessary, features such as the color of the table or plate that the food was sitting on).Accomplishments that we are proud ofWe are most proud of the fact of how well-designed and efficient the app is, as well as the fact that Kenko is now able to identify almost all foods, as well as retrieve the relevant nutritional data with a fairly small margin of error.What we learnedWe learned many things throughout the hackathon, but the big lesson of the day was that image classification requires a lot of computational power in order to train accurate identifiers (especially when it comes to training against a data set as large as the amount of food on Earth).

I’ve designed my own frameworks to build AR apps… fast—and I’ve also used a bunch of other modern programming frameworks. These are a bunch of RealityScript libraries I wrote on top of Unity C#. I built SnapGlass.es Share two years ago, but that was just a simple glasses try-on platform, with a 3x3 look comparison grid inspired by Warby Parker. That was also using OpenCV/Dlib from 2016. Tracking does not make all AR apps the same. Comparing that to this would be like comparing a basic dynamic website to an extensive blogging platform. The amount of work and the insight in software architecture to build the latter from the first is a world of difference. I built FaceShop.io last year before Facebook launched their AR Studio. Despite the similarity in name, for those who understand product, it is clear that my previous project FaceShop.io is very different from FaceStylr. Just in case, I’ll clarify the differences here: FaceShop is more of a “Photoshop for AR” - a general purpose creator software, similar to Facebook AR Studio or Snap Lens, but without relying on either platform. (It also includes a basic Flash ActionScript 1.0-inspired scripting language and a whole lot of things that would only be relevant for a professional creator tool.) FaceStylr is more like a “Polyvore for AR” - primarily a creative platform to discover fashion-related products and share product collections in a personal way that involves AR try-on’s. (Polyvore and Photoshop, though they both start with P, are very different - I hope we agree here!) FaceShop used the old OpenCV Dlib from last year with no stabilization. (And also allows the user to swap other face tracking SDKs, as it is tracking agnostic as a creator platform). ShopFace uses the latest OpenCV v3.4.1 and Dlib v19.7 and may switch to a commercial face tracking platform. Currently, a hackish stabilization with high-pass filters and optical flow is used.ShopFace has a variety of ecommerce and product and even referral link integrations. FaceShop was made directly for iOS on an iPad resolution device; for instant test-ability, FaceStylr was made initially for (desktop) WebGL.Simply summarized, FaceStylr is about creating AR Shopping experiences across the entire ecosystem, with benefits for both consumer and merchants to engage meaningful sales - and not just about creating arbitrary AR filters like FaceShop.

"RimConnect","We aim to bring native Twitch integration to Rimworld and other games via Twitch extensions, increasing viewer interaction and gamifying their experience.","[4777, 'I was watching a Twitch streamer playing Rimworld, their moderators were creating polls through the Strawpoll website, and the viewers were voting on these polls to trigger challenging events for the streamer. However the streamer was using the in-game developer tools to trigger these events and I thought at the time ""You could automate this"".That\'s where the idea came from, a way for viewers to directly influence the narrative of a survival game. Rimworld is a perfect fit, but I think we can do more. ', 'Our extension in its first release will attempt to achieve the above story, however in a native and automated flow. Moderators (and the Broadcaster) can create a poll, with options selected from a defined list of in-game events. Viewers then vote on their preferred outcome, and the game automatically triggers the winning event. This all occurs within the Twitch ecosystem via our video overlay extension, giving the viewer, moderator and broadcaster a unified experience; Never needing to leave Twitch. ', 'Our extension is comprised of 3 parts. The front-end is vanilla (yet modern) JavaScript and is very lightweight, we have plans to upgrade this with a framework (React/Angular/Svelte). Our back-end is a Node.js server hosted on a BaaS for simple scaling and links the game to the extension. Finally and maybe the most important component is the game mod, in our case hosted on Steam Workshop, which queries our back-end for any commands and executes them within the game. ', 'I am familiar with JS, Node, and Mongo databases, I have however never made a mod for a game. Rimworld uses C# and I have very limited experience with it. After the initial struggle of debating architecture and designing our authentication flow (How do you link the game itself to a server when it has no idea about the Twitch streamer?), our next challenge was learning how to actually trigger the events in the game.Luckily we have a well rounded team, and one of our developers (InfinitySamurai) was able to carry the bulk of the weight when it came to C#. Without his expertise this project would have been dead in the water. ', 'We designed an authentication system that uses cryptographic keys to link the game mod to our back-end, creating a secure channel of communication between the streamers game instance and our events server. Bringing this together on top of the complexity involved in having so many moving parts was truly an accomplishment for us.The first time we did an e2e test, and went from creating a poll to voting on options to seeing the item appear in the game was truly astounding! ', ""Releasing a Twitch extension is hard work, there are a lot of hoops you have to jump through to pass review, and what initially started as a very simple concept very quickly evolved into something quite complex. We are very glad that we planned far ahead and it has reinforced for us the importance of good design and planning. Don't leave your reviews to the last minute! "", ""We have so much planned for our extension and we are very excited to make a start, here's a short list of our planned features:Bits! We want to help streamers make more money from their content, so we plan to add the ability for viewers to spend bits to trigger events in the game.Loyalty Points! We want to reward viewers for interacting with our extension and the streamer so we want to allow a system for viewers to earn and spend loyalty points.Event Store! We want the viewers to be able to take full control of the events in the game and directly purchase items/events with their loyalty points.AI Hooking! We want to connect to the games story telling AI, to automatically generate polls to take the weight off the moderators and allow the narrative to still be told in a somewhat natural way.Finally, we want to keep going with this ideal, we want to bring our concept of Twitch integration to more games, we want to gamify the viewing experience on twitch and implement a system that allows the viewer to actually play with the streamer.

"The Endless Weather","What can you learn from your local climate? Where else and when else in the US is very similar to your favorite day?","[7945, ""How many travelers seek destinations with similar weather to their favorite vacation spot? Are you a golfer looking to vary the annual trip to Myrtle Beach, but maintain the same temperature? Are you deciding on family vacation spots, and would love a list of destinations most similar in weather to Cape Cod?Embedded in our fondest memories is the weather of that particular day - a beautiful day at the beach, a perfect day on the slopes, or a sunny day on the greens. What if you could find that weather again somewhere, sometime, could you find that memory as well?In 1966 the famous surf filmmaker Bruce Brown traveled the world in search of an Endless Summer. Spending a year locked in their favorite weather sure turned out to be a great decision. In the spirit of The Endless Summer, I set out to find my own Endless Weather with any conditions I wished, and determine where that would take me- be it Utah, Vermont, or even Wine Country.High quality local climate data is kept in many locations nationwide, but is often just used to help pitch today's forecast or contribute to the global climate picture. What other stories can this data tell? Here, we find out.The IBM Bluemix cloud allowed us to take temperature and precipitation data and turn it into information rich maps and virtual itineraries telling us where and when to be. "", 'Monthly temperature normals (average daily minimum, average daily, average daily maximum) and precipitation normals (25th percentile, median, 75th percentile) are imported into the Apache Spark environment.The data is first formatted through a series of map-reduce steps to create a vector representing the climate normals at each of the 1164 locations for 12 months, a total of 13,968 locations in space and time.These vectors are then compared to every other vector in space and time by computing the euclidian distance, a similarity metric, between the pairs.The resulting similarity values are then organized through another round of map-reduce steps to arrive at 13,968 arrays , each with 13,968 values comparing this time and place with all others (total 195,105,024 values).The results, both graphic and numeric, are presented through a mobile web application allowing the user to quickly and easily position the interactive map to the location of their choice (sorry, only continental United States this iteration!), select the month which they would like to compare against, and have the images shown, as well as explore several tables of data illustrating just where the most similar locations and times are. ', 'Apache Spark provides a Python binding, PySpark, which is ideal for scientific data analysis, given Python\'s strengths in data analysis, statistics, and scientific data libraries.Data from the US National Centers for Environmental Information\'s (NCEI) 1981–2010 Climate Normals were imported to the provided Object Storage. Spark Resilient Distributed Dataset\'s (RDD\'s) are created from these files and joined, then organized through a series of map-reduce operations, resulting in an RDD containing key-value pairs of location/month key and climate normal values.PySpark\'s cartesian operator comes in handy to create a new RDD that is a cartesian product of the original RDD with itself, with all possible pairs (195,105,024 pairs) of keys now represented and ready to be distributed.A method was created using the numpy library to compute the Euclidean distance between each vector pair and mapped to each pair in the RDD. Apache Spark held true to it\'s reputation with over 195 million vector operations taking well less than 1 hour.The RDD containing the distance between each pair of vectors, or similarity between the two, was then organized through a series of map-reduce operations, with the final RDD containing key-value pairs of location/month key and an array of 13,968 similarity values.Using the geographic coordinates of each location, maps representing each calendar month of the year were created. A green/yellow/red color-scale was used with green indicating very similar (go!) conditions and red indicating very different (don\'t go!) conditions. Total images created are 12 images per location per month, a total of 167,616 images. Each image answers a question such as ""How does the month of August across the US compare to my selected location in February?"" ', 'Demo account scalabilityHigh quality climate data is available for nearly 10,000 locations and available on a daily basis. The original idea was to compare all locations, all 366 days of the year (includes leap day). It was quickly determined that the demo account provided for the Sparkathon could not reasonably handle the nearly 91 trillion combinations that result from daily data at the full location list. The locations were trimmed down to only locations in the U.S. Historical Climatology Network (HCN) and monthly data were used to bring the scale of the demo into line with the provided infrastructure. I have no doubt the methods scale well with increased resources and such a large problem is still well suited for the Apache Spark framework.Limited Object StorageWith the intent of creating over 167,000 images, periodic transfer to an external system was required to keep the storage usage below the limit. ', 'Climate science is robust, but the presentation of climate data has been somewhat lacking. Such large datasets in time and space, combined with often complex statistical analysis of the data, can lead to a lessened interest in how to fully utilize the information. I believe this application, of comparing locations, provides a fun, inquisitive and information rich environment to both learn and plan based on local climate data.This model can continue to be refined to bring more data and targeted information to all. ', ""Certainly Apache Spark (PySpark to be specific). As a long time data scientist, numerical methods using numpy are familiar to me, but being able to distribute the processes via an RDD was a real joy and impressive at times. My development cycle was helped by seeing results (and mistakes) quicker than I would have otherwise. Seeing the power and scalability of Apache Spark was a great value in the Sparkathon and Spark will remain a tool I'll use for future projects. "", 'Daily data at all locationsI would love to extend the analysis to all locations and daily data using a much larger Spark infrastructure. Additional data such as wind and snow are available at daily frequencies and could really increase the value of the analysis.Global DatasetsWhere possible global datasets should be incorporated to not only compare the continental US, but all locations worldwide. By creating a comparison of all locations, any user could happen upon any set of weather conditions they can dream of.Incorporate travel costsTravel costs (hotel and airfare) could be incorporated into the results, showing the user not only where and when the conditions are very similar, but also where costs can be minimized for that particular experience.UI developmentWith Big Data being the focus of the Sparkathon, much of the time was used for data analysis. Revisiting the UI development to include native mobile applications and refined layouts could enhance the utilization of the output.

"Story Quality Add-On for JIRA","""It's time to get your story straight!"" — Calculated quality rating for user stories","[2957, ""User stories in agile development are the foundation of a development team's work. Producing and working with user stories of appropriate quality is critical for development teams. There is a need for common understanding of the quality of their stories. "", 'The Story Quality Add-On for JIRA checks and shows the quality of user stories.Its purpose is to help development teams identify and improve low quality and not-yet-ready stories,and possibly avoid starting progress on them.The add-on consists of a custom field and a workflow validator.Custom fieldThe Story Quality calculated field displays a rating of the overall quality of user stories. The field is sortable and searchable, and the rating is an integer value between 0% and 100%, based on different criteria consisting of the INVEST principles and other indicators. The overall rating is a weighed average of these indicators.A greater value indicates a more concise, complete, precise, and clear user story. The general idea is that the closer this value is to 100%, the more likely it is that the story is ready to start progress on, resulting in a more efficient process.In short, this rating gives team members an understanding of the quality and readiness of their stories.Workflow validatorThe Story Quality validator blocks all ""In Progress"" or ""Start Progress"" transitions for non-administrator users (by default) for user stories that have insufficient quality rating, that is, points less than the minimum specified for the project. This helps ensure that the team is working only on stories that are ready for development.IndicatorsThe indicators are rating the quality of a story (a JIRA issue of type ""Story"") based on different criteria. These criteria are designed from a developers\' point of view, because their work is impacted first hand by the quality of the stories.An indicator is calculating a point between 0% and 100% (inclusive), where 0% means the lowest, and 100% means the highest quality. The calculation can be any mathematical formula, but most indicator implementations are starting with maximum points (100%) and then giving penalty points for problems they find.See detailed description of indicator calculations in the readme.

"TSOLife","TSOLife is a online platform that allows users to record a digital legacy to leave behind for future generations","[5715, 'Everyone likes a good origin story, how did it all get started? The company TSOLife was incorporated in Sept 2014, but the concept was inspired decades before. It was inspired by loving grandparents, who helped raise a grandson from birth.My grandfather was a remarkable man, he had the opportunity to be an Olympic athlete, he was the recipient of the civic recognition award and he was inducted into his high schools hall of fame. His life is not only worth celebrating, it is worth remembering. The stories of his accomplishments could currently soon be lost. Verbal history dies after only 2 generations. There is no Wikipedia page dedicated to his life, no published biography documenting his many achievements; there is strictly what we remember.As it currently stands, history is only recorded for the famous or infamous, the rest are left to be forgotten. TSOLife was created with the conviction that we are all worth remembering–that life should be celebrated, passed down and remembered. We all deserve to leave behind a personalized legacy. History isn’t just for the famous or infamous but for all of us to leave something behind.While I have always felt strongly about this vision, it finally hit me when my grandmother passed in 2014 around thanksgiving. There is so much I never got to know about her, and even more I will forget. The only lasting legacy she left behind was her funeral service page. The notion that all that my grandkids will ever be able to learn about her is her name, date of birth, and occupation, haunts me.That notion ignited a fire: from that moment on I dedicated my life to creating a web platform that will truly allow our story to transcend time. I created TSOLife, and it will soon be launched nationwide in August. It is my greatest accomplishment thus far in life, and also my greatest regret because I didn’t make it soon enough for my grandparents. Their story is in my hands to tell, and I will do my best… though I know so much history has already been lost. ', 'TSOLife is an online platform where users can craft the story of their lives. For a one-time fee, a user\'s personal history is hosted and maintained forever through a perpetual funding model leveraging cloud storage. On TSOLife\'s beautifully simple and integrated platform, stories, videos, photos, and memories can be preserved for future generations, allowing the user to leave behind a personal legacy. The stories can be categorized, and will also be placed on a timeline of events and on an interactive global map. Users also have the feature option of creating their own family tree and personal network linking with past and future members of their family.A feature that fully captures our vision and embodies our idea of connecting to the future and past is the ""wish I were there"" feature. This unique function allows members to write a specialized message, record a video, and/or upload an audio file that can be delivered on a specific date or event in the future. For example, a personal message can be sent to a great grandchild, on his or her high school graduation day, or to a child on their 50th anniversary. TSOLife ensures the preservation of family memories and emotional connections and ties the past, present, and future together in a beautiful ever-changing story.Challenges we ran intoA primary challenge we ran into, was that we wanted a way to ensure our users that the information would be hosted forever and find a way to make that financially sustainable. We were able to develop a onetime fee pricing model that allowed us to calculate the cost of host information forever and by determining the net present value of the information stored and charging based on that number. We believe that once history is online it should be free to view for future generations and friends.Accomplishments that we\'re proud ofMajor Accomplishments and Awards:•2015: Carins Foundation Innovation Challenge winner•2015: Score Biz Fest winner•2015: Met Kickstarter funding goal•2015: Florida Venture Form finalisthttp://www.cultofmac.com/400088/tsolife-is-a-place-where-your-story-can-live-long-after-you-do/#more-400088http://www.news-journalonline.com/article/20150905/NEWS/150909709http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/technology/tech_check/os-stetson-story-telling-app-launch-20151019-post.htmlWhat we learnedWe learned that nursing home residents in the United States have the highest concentration of depression.

"HappyHour","Don't lose track of the night.","[2657, ""For students away at universities, it has become more important than ever to know how to take care of oneself. As college students, we are exposed to a variety of things, including alcohol. Even though we've all had educational classes or seminars in school about drinking safely, sometimes a gentle reminder can make a huge difference. That's where we came up with the idea of HappyHour, a pebble app that can keep you safe.  "", ""HappyHour initially asks users for a couple of inputs: height, weight, and gender. These parameters will be used to calculate the blood-alcohol-content (BAC). BAC is a universal measurement of the alcohol in an individual's system. It is a complex equation that our application simplified for each individual personally. From then onwards, users can specify a '+' or a '-' button, allowing them to keep track of how many drinks they've had with a click of a button. The BAC accordingly updates and creates a vibration, reminding them about their drinks. When the BAC is above 0.08 (the legal threshold for drunk driving), HappyHour creates a longer vibration, indicating that the user should take an Uber home. A click on the select button will trigger an http request that the pebble sends to our node.js server, where we use Uber and Twilio API to text the user information on the nearest Uber, time required to take them home, and estimated price. Challenges We ran intoDeveloping on Pebble Time was a learning curve at some points, especially when we were having trouble uploading color resources and performing GET http requests to send longitude and latitude data. Accomplishments that We are proud ofWe are definitely proud of parsing through the Uber JSON API data, as well as setting up Pebble Time to perform GET XMLHttp requests and extract information from that to obtain the geographic coordinates of the Pebble. The entire process of getting user-selected data and displaying the BAC in real time was also difficult, but we've learned a lot in the process!What's next for HappyHourWe hope to clean up the user interface code a bit (it's difficult to have good coding habits at hackathons!).

"bSmart Smart Diabetes Management System","Manage Type 1 diabetes through IoT technologies","[6226, ""Two years ago my 4 year old daughter was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes and since then my main goal in life has been to manage her blood sugar (BG) levels within an acceptable range. Although there are quite a few technologies out there that are of great help in the management of Type 1 Diabetes, I believe there is a lot more we can do to make the lives of Type 1 Diabetics and their care givers easier. I work in data analytics in my day job and thought latest technologies like Internet-of-Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning/Deep Learning can be of great help in the management of Type 1 Diabetes. In the quest for better management of my daughter's BG numbers I decided to embark on this project to build a system that will capture all the information it can, in real-time, and analyze it and suggest treatment options in an easy to consume format i.e. text messages on phone. This system, in its fully developed form, could act like an AI brain which can suggest treatment plans in real-time to care givers/baby sitters.Type 1 Diabetes is an auto-immune disease in which the pancreas stops producing insulin which is an important hormone for converting food into energy. There are 1.5 Million Americans living with Type 1 diabetes and it costs more than $15 Billion each year to manage this disease. Diabetes is the most expensive chronic disease in America today. Improving the care for Type 1 diabetics is not only good for the patients themselves but also for the whole society in terms of lowering healthcare costs.Typically a Type 1 Diabetic's BG goes up when they eat food and their BG comes down when they inject insulin via an insulin pump or insulin shot. The BG could go too high if not enough insulin is taken and the BG could go dangerously low if too much insulin is taken. Currently healthcare providers suggest insulin dose based on a formula which takes into account the number of carbs in the food eaten. But a true calculation of the insulin dose should also take into account other factors such as the type of food and the activity level to name a few. Making sure the BG level stays within range is a daily battle and any assistance with this would be of great help. "", 'The system I developed tries to integrate data from two devices namely an insulin pump and a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) every 5 minutes and uses the insulin intake and BG data to predict what the BG levels will be in the next 2 hours. If the predicted BG is too high then an SMS text message is sent to the care giver suggesting an insulin dose and if the predicted BG is too low then a text message is sent suggesting low treatment to the care giver. No SMS message is sent if the predicted BG is within range. This system could be expanded to integrate other information like activity, heart rate and ambient temperature all of which have an impact on the BG levels. ', 'Data from the insulin pump and CGM is read using a third party android app which stores the data in a mongoDB. I wrote a python script to read the mongoDB every 2 mins and extract the data and send it to the Azure IoT Hub. An Azure function listens to the Azure IoT Event Hub and stores the data in an Azure SQL Database. Every 10 mins another Azure function reads all the data in the Azure SQL server and executes a stored procedure to create the BG forecast. If the predicted BG is too high or low the Azure function sends a message to a Azure Storage Queue which in turn triggers another Azure Function which sends a text message via Twilio service. Bulk of my time was spent in building the stored procedure which creates the BG Forecast which is currently rules based but could be expanded to leverage machine learning. ', ""Initially I wanted to develop the python script to run on a raspberry pi and connect to the insulin pump directly but realized it was too much of a technical challenge to deal with. Hence I resorted to using a third party app and also used my laptop instead of the raspberry pi to run the python script.The prediction engine needed to be tuned to my daughter's numbers to enable it to make sensible predictions. To make the system more universally usable we need to replace the current rules based engine to a Machine Learning driven algorithm.The text messages were initially schedule to run every 5 minutes which ended up annoying my wife who was one of the recipients of the messages, hence I had to reduce it to every 10 minutes. "", ""This is the first time I have been able to analyze my daughter's numbers in real-time and take corrective action based on the numbers. Lot of people rely on rules or gut feeling while managing their kids Type 1 Diabetes. I believe this system has the potential of making lives easy and protect kids with Type 1 diabetes from the harmful effects of sustained out-of-range BG levels. Since this system relies on text messaging to communicate the treatment plan it can help non-technical care givers. "", ""Predicting accurately is a herculean task. It requires a trial and error approach to get the algorithm right. Always err on the side of safety when predictions are related to healthcare. It's a fine balance between sending alerts when most needed and avoiding annoying the person we need to alert. Again trial and error approach helps to get the optimal level of alerting.

After performing unit testing of these individual components we did a system integration to launch an android application that detects cataract. Since the machine learning component required the data to be in a better quality, we used some image enhancement techniques to preprocess our data. We could not get any annotated data online, so we collected the data ourselves from Google Images. We took a dataset of 60 patients (30 cataract infected and 30 normal healthy people). We divided this dataset into 40, 10 and 10 patients for Training, Development and Testing purposes. The most important feature for this study was the whiteness of the small ring of the eye. In Cataract images, the inner surface of the cornea is more whitish as compared to that of normal images. We also took into account the Big Ring Area of the eye. In cataract images, the outer surface of the cornea images is bright in color as compared to that of the normal patients' image. Also, we took into account the Edge Pixel Count. Canny method is the most powerful edge detection method among them. It uses two different thresholds (to detect strong and weak edges), and it includes the weak edges in the output only if they are connected to strong edges. In the computation of EPC, we counted the number of white pixels in the output of the edge detection. Now, with all these features, we chose the Unsupervised K-means clustering algorithm as out baseline Machine Learning algorithm. The reason behind that was having access to only non-annotated data. The algorithm divides the datapoints into two sections (or clusters) which are separable. The test datapoint can be incorporated with the cluster to which its closer (Euclidean distance). From the Android side, we used Material Design concepts to bring together a clean and sleek UI that helps to minimize stress when dealing with diseases. We provide educational materials along with out ML backed algorithms to deliver information in a straightforward manner. Users would get to know more about how to deal with cataracts. To ease users into the app, plenty of animations were implemented to guide users around the app, making sure that buttons are reused and minimal learning is required. "", 'We could not find any publicly available annotated dataset for eye images affected with Cataract. The idea behind having a labeled dataset was the ease of usage of powerful supervised learning algorithms. Since, we were not able to get the labeled data, we scraped images from Google Image Search manually and built a non-annotated dataset, for Machine Learning purposes. We also tried to extend this work over another eye disease Conjunctivitis, but we could not get good results owing to the dataset that we had. Since this is a Health hack and we do not want to recommend random suggestions to the patients, we decided not to include it with EyePhone. ', 'We are happy to present an application that tries to positively impact the lives of the people. Our application is at a one-click launch able stage. We believe our application would be a useful tool not only for the general population but also to the medical industry. We also believe that EyePhone is not only capable of detecting cataract at an early, but also acts as an interactive tool that helps to educate the general population.  ', 'We learned a lot about Computer Vision techniques and ways to play with image-related datasets. We also realized how important it is to do image preprocessing and image enhancement before we use Machine Learning algorithms to train and test the data.  ', 'We plan to launch EyePhone on the Google Play Store soon. We also plan to extend the EyePhone to incorporate other diseases such as Glaucoma and Conjunctivitis.

","[2703, 'One of our team members is from India and is aware of the struggles that those of rural India face. Based on his observations, and some research we learned that a large portion of the global population does not have documented medical history. This means that when seeking medical treatment providers may be unaware of things like medical conditions, allergies to medicine, and previous medical history. Our goal is to create an inexpensive, scalable system to allow access to medical records for all. By carrying a card (for example a government issued ID) with all this information attached it would speed up hospital wait times, ensure proper care, and expand the total population with documented medical records.  ', 'We created a system that reads a unique RFID tag which corresponds to a  medical record file stored on the google cloud.

This was our first time using RFID, so we took some time to learn the basics. ', 'We have a working system, that seems feasible. The RFID readers that hospitals would need to purchase only cost around $60 (INR 4300). The RFID tags cost only $0.10 (INR 7). These costs could be greatly reduced by buying the tags in bulk and using integrated PCBs for the hospital scanners. Currently a government issued Indian ID costs $0.70, so a $0.10 increase appears practical.  ', 'This was our first hackathon for two of our members.

"Super Creature Showdown","Super Creature Showdown for Echo &amp; Alexa is a game where super creatures battle, &amp; your math skills find the winner!","[5450, ""Super Creature Showdown started as a hand-drawn game that I would put in my son Jack's lunch box each morning. Jack is 5-years-old and LOVES all things nature. Every day he'd look forward to getting a new Super Creature Showdown. Each morning I'd work to make them more and more elaborate, ultimately turning it into a math-based game with the goal of being fun and educational. This past Christmas we got an Echo Show and we thought it would be a great winter break project to build out a voice-based game. "", ""Super Creature Showdown tests your math skills in a fun, 3 round battle to determine each creature's Strength, Speed and Smarts. In each round you answer by saying which creature had the greater score. In the 4th, and final, Showdown round you add up the scores for each round and say the winning creature's score. At the end of each game a fun fact is revealed about the Showdown winner.In keeping with the tradition of Jack's lunch box games, I wanted Super Creature Showdown to have a physical component. Each Showdown has a companion PDF that can be printed and used as a game board to keep score. Showdowns can be downloaded from SuperCreatureShowdown.com "", 'Super Creature Showdown was truly a family effort. My wonderful wife, Katie, teaches 2nd grade, and her insight into education was a huge benefit in helping make the game fun, educational and age appropriate. Certainly Jack was a huge inspiration, and even our 2-year-old, Luke, got involved.We built the game by starting on paper and working out the game logic and pacing. I then moved into coding using the Alexa Skills Kit SDK for Node.js. The SDK made it really fun to develop for Alexa, and leveraging Amazon Web Services made everything fast and efficient. I opted to have an external config file hosted on Amazon S3. This allows me to easily add new Showdowns without having to republish the skill. ', ""Time. Time. Did I mention time? I worked on development over winter break, so coding between holiday events, parties and just everyday life made for quite a sprint. Don't get me wrong, it was a ton of fun. Also, working on UX for voice is really challenging – Things you take for granted on a website, or in an App, really present unique scenarios with voice. On a whole, I loved every minute of it. I think there are a lot of improvements to be made, but we all think this is off to a good start. "", 'For me personally, I\'m most proud of how involved my whole family was in making this game. It was really exciting to talk about it as a family and as a team. My wife is really tech savvy and has a background in English Literature, so it was awesome to have her helping streamline the voice and language components. She also teaches 2nd grade, so having her insight into how to help structure the math-based game play was also a huge help. My son, Jack, was a rockstar\xa0– He helped with ideas, debugging and testing. It was really cool to see him watch the development process and how excited he was about it. We did a lot of tests with custom audio, so it was also fun to seem him learn about recording sound, recognizing audio as waveforms and starting to understand volume. Speaking of volume – Our 2-year-old, Luke, got a kick out of watching us all talk to Alexa. She can\'t quite understand him yet, but he\'s definitely saying, ""Alexa, open Super Creature Showdown""! :)  ', ""Wow. What didn't we learn? I've been doing professional design and development for 20 years and I'm amazed about the things I've learned working on a voice-based experience. I'm really excited about it and I'm looking forward to continue working in this space. For the rest of the family, I think it's a mix; Jack is really excited about computers, Katie is really excited about technology and education, and Luke is really excited about everything! "", 'This is definitely a 1.0 release. There\'s a number of things we\'re looking to improve. I know there are some things in the UX that need to be worked out. Also, some handling of utterances and intents. From a game perspective, the game has score keeping and custom audio support. We\'d like to better work that into the experience. Adding ""easy"" and ""difficult"" modes would be fun, too. Oh, and giving kids (of all ages) the ability to create their own creatures and battle against friends! Not to mention at least twenty other things I\'ve got jotted down on a notepad. :)Thanks for checking out Super Creature Showdown! It\'s a work-in-progress – We hope you enjoy our game and we\'d love to know your thoughts!

None of the current solutions on the market have yet have come to dominate and establish themselves as a defacto standard. This creates challenges for new communities when trying to select a system, often resulting in a perverse cycle of creating yet another management system that only sort of works for that particular community.At an high-level, these are the issues preventing widespread adoption of a single system:each system is often the result of a part-time or short-term volunteer effortsdifficult to reach a critical mass of users adoption necessary to sufficient generalize the systemchallenges in creating a critical mass of developers around the open source projectpoor understanding of global requirements (i18n/l10n, payment gateways integration, taxes, etc)hard for individual communities to evaluate the software quality attributes of a particular systemcomplexity in maintaining the software solutions and the data it generatesThis results in numerous problems, among which:time spent on management instead of makingredundant efforts invested in systemslack of support and long term maintenancelack of a defacto standard API to third party components (door locks)Frederic Bazin (founder of agora-space.com) and Ricky Ng-Adam (cofounder of xinchejian.com) with the help of Julien Choulet (a new active member and MeteorJS specialist) face these challenges regularly.

"Confucius","Confucius offers a revolutionary way for people to obtain information, giving users so much more than just news.","[6736, ""Confucius is the combination of Spotify music, Soundcloud, and breaking news in one package.The inspiration came from the fact that as university students, we don't have the time to constantly be looking for the best news sources. We also don’t have time to sit down and read the news diligently, especially when we are busy. Not only that, we found that with existing news applications, we were visually distracted while online, and were not able to just listen to the articles on these websites. We came up with an app that aggregates multiple news sources and translates their articles to audio, enabling users to take news with them on the go. "", 'With one tap, the user is able to listen to any article from playlists, trending articles of the day, and different genres from top news sources, in order to give the users the latest news on the go. Unlike other news app where users have to scroll through articles to read them, Confucius allows the user to LISTEN to an article. With our hands-free news app, we give users so much more than just news. We give users the freedom to be informed while on the go. ', 'Confucius is composed of three primary components: WEB SCRAPER, CLOUD BACKEND, iOS USER INTERFACE.WEB SCRAPER:     In order to populate our cloud implementation backend with text articles, we had to create a web scraper using Kimono Labs technology. Written in JavaScript and Python, we were able to crawl multiple websites ranging from BBC news, The New York Times, to the Onion and National Geographic. Using Heroku, and cloud logic, we are able to automate this web scraping process to grab the latest articles at regular time intervals. That way, our cloud database is always up to date with the top most recent articles.CLOUD BACKEND:     We implemented our backend data storage with the Parse API, a cloud database implementation. Following web scraping, we interfaced this database with iOS querying methods to easily write to and write from our cloud database. Most importantly, this database enabled us to populate our front end user interface with all the most up to date articles, hottest news article playlists, etc.iOS UI/UX:     In order to take advantage of our solid backend, we had to build a front end capable of reflecting all the information in the cloud to the user in a simple and intuitive way. Every part of our UI/UX has been thought about, and we have taken validated User Interface tips from other top mobile applications.     We decided that a Tab bar is the most straightforward and intuitive way to show all the pages in our application, taking only one tap to change from page to page. On each page, useful indicators enable users to intuitively navigate our application with satisfying swipe and tap gestures.. ', ""While we were able to complete implementing most of the features that we had designed in the beginning, we found it difficult to strike a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simplicity is always welcomed in terms of user experience; however, we felt that there were certain relatively 'complex' features that benefited the user experience. The only way to figure this out is from user feedback and we hope to keep incorporating data to maximize the user experience. "", ""We are most proud of the fact that we considered all aspects of a potential business when designing this application, keeping in mind that a successful app hinges on our FIT with customer demands/preferences, designing a product that customers actually WANT and that competitors have yet to MAKE.We take pride in the fact that we have placed deep thought about the business model, and how users will interact with the application.The beauty of Confucius lies in its smooth and enjoyable UX/UI, and we're proud that we have accomplished just that.We truly believe that users will enjoy the freedom that this application bestows on the user to be informed on the go, creating a product that other news apps simply don’t have. "", 'This is our first hackathon and the biggest difference was the fact that we had discussed about our ideas beforehand. Coming into Junction, we already had a clear, general idea of what we wanted to make, and as soon as we got here, we were able to utilize the available resources to implement our idea quickly. With this time advantage, we were able to concentrate more on the app design, UX, and UI, which gives our app greater leverage over competitors. ', 'With the basic features in place, we believe that Confucius is a differentiated product. We need to continue executing on our business model, marketing our application to potential customers in order to generate interest. Customers include those that would pay for subscription accounts with access to premium articles. In addition, we seek to generate interest in the advertising sector. With greater network effects from a growing user base, we think that we can generate revenue from advertisements in the long run.Furthermore, we will continue differentiate our application with more features:-Provide more news sources-Enable users to crowdsource article recordings of their own voices ']","['ios', 'parse', 'python', 'javascript', 'heroku', 'photoshop', 'kimono']","False","19","['keikumata', 'raghavkedia', 'michaellee94', 'ejyuan13', 'jaeraw']","https://firefly-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/usercontent/fill/242/161/cGhvdG9zL3Byb2R1Y3Rpb24vc29mdHdhcmVfdGh1bWJuYWlsX3Bob3Rvcy8wMDAvMzE2Lzg1Ni9kYXRhcy9vcmlnaW5hbC5wbmc=/Default_2x.png?signature=819e2e1456627816f813ed8ecd848b48b8fae310","False","2"
"CloudSonar","Let CloudSonar find an event you should watch","[4364, 'The critical event any IT service provider cares is a service outage(e.g. HTTP 5xx response). But there are just too many variables. uptime, Java gc counts/time, CPU, I/O util, swap memory usage, etc.Whenever you try to detect a service outage before it happens, you get screwed up by those countless variables.One day, I noticed Apache Cassandra uses a very simple metrics to detect a node failure, which is based on the following theory.http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~defago/files/pdf/IS_RR_2004_010.pdfThis inspired me to try HTM against simple PING response times to predict possible high load that could generate an error. ', ""It polls a given set of nodes by PING periodically. Then, record its response times, and which are fed to PhiFailureDetector and HTMAnomalyDetector to detect an important event to watch out.Please refer to Concept on my project for details.Case StudyThe case study I have investigated was done on a 6 nodes Cloudian HyperStore(S3 object storage) cluster. You can simply think of it as a distributed file system with a web interface. All the HTTP requests were routed to cloudian-node1, then distributed among 6 storage services. The traffic pattern I used was a constantly high traffic for this cluster, which would produce an error if some more requests had been added.To make it overloaded, a temporal random traffic surge was added every hour. Then, as expected, 6 errors were observed as follows.Now, the first question is if this tool could have provided a useful information based on anomaly score by HTM before they happened.The followings are examples against node1 taken on node3.HTM inputs, log10 of response time in micro seconds, looked like this.This looks there is no direct indication of such an error. For example, around 6:50, there were 4 503 errors. But no particular spike there. There could be a hidden pattern, but may be not. Let's see.And this is the distribution. 2.5 is around 300 micro seconds.PhiFailureDetector shows a server health. It is below 1.0, if it is fine. The lower, the better. You can set a horizontal line(threshold) to identify a bad node.Here, as you can see, there are so many high values over 1.0. Some spikes are even beyond 10(0.0000001%). This indicates that the server was under high load.A PHI value is a good indication of server health, but simply lowering a threshold doesn't really help. For example, if you would set 2.0, the first alarm could have been given around 22:10, followed by many more alerts. You may try 5.0 to avoid too many alarms. But you still have no idea if this is OK or not. HTMAnomalyDetector allows you to see a vertical line instead of a horizontal line(threshold), which indicates an anomaly, the time when unexpected pattern was observed against its prediction(max in the next 30 seconds).As you can see, HTM detected whenever a pattern has changed.ConclusionCloud Sonar is not an oracle, so can not tell when an error could happen. But Cloud Sonar is confirmed that it can give an anomaly whenever a pattern changes.If you look back a pattern when your server got overloaded, then you'll see the first point that became higher than its usual pattern. And it must be the first possible point you could be notified.So, the best way to deal with an unexpected event is to know as soon as possible when a change is observed. And it is what Cloud Sonar can provide. "", 'Using HTM.java, and Swarming to find optimal configurations. ', 'HTM parameter tunings.=> Let Swarming find==> Takes long...  HTM input scale.

"BZ - Secure Online Sharing","Securely save and share files through distributed secret sharing","[2786, ""Damian suggested looking deeper into Shamir's Secret Sharing, a secret sharing algorithm that could serve as an interesting encryption tool. Despite its potential use-cases, there have been limited real-life applications of the idea. Furthermore, such applications have been limited to only protecting strings. Hence, we decided to take this idea further and provide a SAAS - storing files securely using the same idea, and making it convenient to do so by abstracting away all the technicalities. "", 'Provide a platform for people to securely store their files. Files are encrypted (with the original file discarded), and the secret decryption key (which is also later discarded) is split into shares which are essentially ""keys"" that, when enough are put together, allow for the original key to be recovered. Gaining access to the files requires an adjustable number of shares that are combined together to form the final secret. For example, if the number of shares is set to 5 and the threshold is 3, there will be a total of 5 shares to be distributed, and 3 or more are required for the original key to be recovered and hence decrypt the file. This can be used in a variety of ways, such as to ensure credibility and also to make sure that files can be retrieved still even if some of the shares are lost. To further add security, whenever the file is decrypted, the decrypted file is promptly deleted after the user downloads the file.

"DD - tLaundry","tShirts taken to the nextTier(); ","[4633, 'Our entire team is from Tembusu Residential College. We often experience inconvenience when using the washer and dryer machine as we are not sure whether the machines are used. This causes our residents to waste an immeasurable amount of time constantly checking if the machines are available for use or have completed their cycle. Thus, we thought, ""Why not let the users tell others whether the machines are being used?"" This will help save our time and energy as assessing the availability of the machines is just a click away!  We have witnessed Telegram Bots improving our quality of life, such as the SupperJio, CountMeIn bot and many more. Therefore, we are inspired to create this bot. :) ', 'In Tembusu, there are 2 levels that contain laundry rooms. The bot provides information on the availability of the washers and dryers on each floor with the /check9 or /check17 function. Since the bot has a user-based system, residents of Tembusu have to use the bot to update the machine status. Residents can decide which washers or dryers they would like to use, update the bot, check the amount of time left and also receive notification when their load is done. Additionally, the userId of the resident on telegram would be tied to the washer/dryer, thus it is possible to send a message via the bot to the previous user to collect their clothes if they did not. Once the time is up, the washer/dryer would be available again. ', 'We wrote the bot with Node.js and Telegram-bot API, with the help of Firebase SDK. ', ""A major limitation of this bot is the fact that it is a user-based application. Without accurate users' contribution, the reliability of the information provided by the Telegram Bot may be questionable. We also find it difficult to incentivise more users to make use of the bot, so as to keep the machine status updated and accurate.Accomplishments that we are proud ofWe added a nudge function to nudge the last user of the machine to remind them to remove their clothes quickly. We find that this is a necessary function because some people may not remove their clothes immediately as they are preoccupied with other tasks. When users receive this nudge, they will know that there is someone waiting to use that machine and would go and clear their clothesWhat I learnedWe learned how to make a working Telegram Bot using node.js, linking to firebase and constantly thinking of better ways to optimise our code. What's next for Tembusu LaundrobotA possible improvement will be to install a sensor on the machines that detects whether a washer/dryer is in use. For example, it may be possible to detect a jump in the electricity current when a machine is in use. This will eliminate the need for user input to update the state of the machine, effectively overcoming the challenges stated above. We are aware that there is another group of Tembusians working on using light sensors to detect when the machines are being used, and we are planning to collaborate with them for future developments.Since there may be a possibility that there are faulty machines, we plan to input a report function into our code, such that users can report to the bot that a certain machine is faulty, so that other users would be aware of the number of machines actually available for use. The report function will probably change the status of the machine to unavailable, until the college is notified and fixes the machine.

"TruClinic","Delivering the tools and data healthcare providers need across all care settings and into the home","[8564, ""Justin Kahn was struck in the head with a baseball bat when he was 14 years old. In his teens and twenties, he would suffer from anxiety and panic attacks. When Justin was 27, he had a panic attack that scared him into seeking out the help of a neurologist. After working with her for almost a year, she discovered that he did not have PTSD. Instead, what he had been experiencing for 13 years, were seizures that were caused by the traumatic brain injury. She put him on an anti-seizure medication that alleviated what he had been experiencing.In 2009, he read an article that was in the speech that Robert Gates, the former Secretary of Defense, gave to the graduating class of West Point. He said that the Department of Defense was going to begin investing billions of dollars each year to address the PTSD epidemic plaguing all branches of the military. Justin grew up around the VA. His stepfather was an administrator for the VA. He thought that the way to address this problem would be to establish a relationship at the beginning of the service member’s career with their home state VA and have it continue into the rest of their lives. He knew from his own experience that the most effective mechanism for him to deal with his seizures, which can be similar to the symptoms of PTSD, was having someone to talk to. A lot has been done to address mental health in the military, but there are some service members that do not proactively address the issues they are dealing with. The reason is there can be a stigma attached with having mental health issues, as well as real world implications because they can be pulled away from their unit, possibly lose rank or pay, get passed over for advancement, or even be discharged. The result is, as troops transition to veteran status, some come back suffering from traumatic experiences that are having a dramatic effect on their transition back to civilian life. Justin approached the Salt Lake VA with the idea of having active duty troops being able to meet with VA practitioners from their home state while deployed, and have it be done through secure video conferencing. The VA agreed to test the concept of online care by teaching relaxation exercises to a small group veterans to see if they would have the same retention rate or better as doing in-person. When Justin received pre-seed capital in 2012 to start TruClinic, he approached his friend and software engineer, Trevor Wilkin. Justin Kahn/CEO and Trevor Wilkin/CTO have known each other since 2007, and have worked on multiple creative projects together. Brian Russon was originally introduced to TruClinic while he was with Microsoft and looking for Surface use cases in healthcare, of which we were utilizing with the University of Utah’s NICU unit. Brian joined the company initially in an advisory role for over three years before joining the company as Chief Revenue Officer. Lori Douglas joined the company as a result of her excellent work in the physician staffing industry with one of our investor/board members when we identified the need for someone to manage and grow our existing clients to ensure client success with our early adopters. Alex Zoller & Vitaly Leokumovich, co-Founders of Overl.ai joined the company in 2017 with the TruClinic acquisition of Overl.ai. Alex has over 10 years in the EHR industry and is now TruClinic's Head of Product. Vitaly is the co-Founder of IDEOM and Ego7 and is now TruClinic's VP of Engineering.  "", ""TruClinic connects the clinical applications and services healthcare organizations need to fit their unique workflows and patient population by streamlining communication between multiple clinical systems and services to eliminate repetitive tasks and data entry. Fast access to information when providers need it leaves them with the time they need to focus on patient care by staying connected with patients through telehealth technologies.TruClinic gives the caregivers the tools they need to provide the right types of healthcare services and information at the right time to best serve the patient's individual needs. TruClinic is used as an extensibility of the systems the providers and staff use on a daily basis. TruClinic solves the problem of patient management, patient engagement and patient adherence by giving the providers the ability to customize the telehealth experience based on their different subsets of patients. "", 'Trevor Wilkin and Jon Fuller/Director of Customer Support were the driving force of the first two iterations of the TruClinic platform. The first version was built on a LAMP stack using Javascript. Version 1.0 used a Flash based video codec. TruClinic was an early adopter of WebRTC for the video codec which was rolled out in Version 2, along with moving away from Javascript and into Node.js and Angular. Version 3 (code name: Olympus) is built on Node.js, Angular, React and Typescript.  ', 'We believed that TruClinic would be the solution that providers would flock to. The thought at first was to get customers, regardless of size of practice or length of sales cycle. We were not charging enough either. The positive side of the challenge was that we got a birds eye view into all different types of healthcare providers. The negative side was that we did not have a cohesive sales strategy and it was very hard to predict revenue. Small practices were easy to sell to, but they had high attrition rates because they did not have the infrastructure or budget to implement a successful and scalable telemedicine strategy. Enterprise customers have the infrastructure and budgets, but the sales cycles can be anywhere between 6 months to 2 years. This experience helped to shape the customer acquisition strategy and that helped us focus on hone in on our sales process.Fundraising was also a major challenge. As a small company where everyone is wearing multiple hats, the time and resources needed to fundraise were taking away from other tasks that needed to be completed. The executive team decided to raise the least amount of funds possible and to bootstrap for as long as possible. The whole team learned to operate using lean methodology and kept the growth in line with revenue. The company was not able to grow as fast as it had projected, but it gave us time to work out all the bugs before it was ready to scale. ', 'TruClinic was a winner of the Village Capital/VentureWell/SOURCE/Hitachi Foundation accelerator in 2014. The company is also an alumni of the Startup Bootcamp Miami accelerator in 2016. TruClinic currently has 11 employees and 7 independent contractors. The technology has been featured in trade organizations and publications such as The Advisory Board, AGC Partners, IDC Global Insights, the Journal of mHealth & Healthcare IT News. The company has two issued patents which outline the process for browser based online healthcare consultations (US Patent 8,718,245 and US Patent 9,374,394) with a third in review. TruClinic currently has 25 customers spanning 4 continents, in 7 countries and in all 50 states. ', 'The use cases for telehealth are as broad as the providers and the patients they care for. We have learned that our customers want a flexible technology with a modular feature set that they can scale throughout their entire organization. We have also learned that healthcare moves at different paces, depending on the priorities, budget, internal teams, etc. We learned to work with our customers to develop the strategies and deployment plans that will lead to a successful rollout. We treat our customers like partners and learn as much from them as they do from us. ', ""We will be doing a fundraise at the end of Q1/2017 for sales and marketing scale. On the technology front, we will be integrating biometric, biofeedback and wearable feeds intro TruClinic sessions, and will continue with additional EHR integrations.

"Driverless Arduino 101 Rover","A demonstration of vehicle to vehicle communication technology and active collision avoidance.","[15958, 'Many kinds of everyday automation exist in the world of today. Home control systems allow you to control lights in your house over the internet, coffee makers start before you wake up, and you can release a small robot to vacuum your floor.While not everyone may have the need for a robotic vacuum, or want to control their house over the internet, it is extremely difficult if not impossible to find someone in the developed world who will be left unaffected by self driving vehicles. You won’t even have to own one to have your life revolutionized by them. Public transportation will become driverless, traffic flows will become seamless, and people will even release their cars out into their local area to work as taxis for them!These vehicles will need to use collision avoidance systems, still being perfected today, to stay out of the way of obstacles such as people, signs, the side of the road, and other vehicles. This kind of system is adequate in today’s world, full of traffic lights and conscious drivers, but another technology will need to be proven before humans get off the road. This technology is vehicle to vehicle communication. Without this, driverless cars will be restricted to relying on local sensors, and the traffic jams of today will only become worse. Using vehicle to vehicle communication, not only can cars practice actions such as synchronized acceleration and deceleration, alleviating these jams, but can talk to each other ahead of an intersection to avoid a collision. The latter was the focus of this project.My project used an Arduino 101, along with some electronic sensors, to convert an old remote-control car into an intelligent, driverless vehicle that can communicate with other vehicles in order to avoid an imminent collision, along with being able to avoid simple obstacles. ', ""The vehicle has two main functions:Continuous Collision Avoidance ModeIn this mode, I simply send the vehicle an “On” signal through bluetooth, and it turns on the rear motor. I can then step back and watch it avoid trees, houses, chairs people, and just about anything else it encounters in its path. The vehicle can successfully navigate an obstacle course on its own.Demo of Driverless Vehicle to Vehicle Communication in an IntersectionThis mode exists to show what an intersection between two cars might look like in a future with vehicle to vehicle communication. The scenario goes as follows: Two cars, at least one of them driverless, are approaching an intersection of two roads, one vehicle traveling on each road. When the driverless car receives information indicating the other car is approaching dangerously from the other road, it slows down and/or stops to avoid a collision. In this mode, I can connect the driverless Arduino 101-powered vehicle to another vehicle with an onboard computer. The other vehicle is a simple RC car being controlled by a human being, with an onboard computer running linux that is bluetooth enabled. This mode is tested in the following way: the two vehicles are connected and sent on a possible collision course. The Arduino receives GPS information from the RC vehicle, and determines if the two are headed for a collision. If so, the Arduino vehicle will stop and let the RC vehicle pass by.How It WorksThe vehicle is built upon an old hobbyist remote-control car chassis, and uses the servo motor, motor controller, battery, and rear motor of the vehicle. The Arduino 101 serves as the brain of the vehicle, processing input from different kinds of sensors.Continuous Collision Avoidance ModeWhen powered on, the Arduino becomes visible to bluetooth devices. I wrote an iOS application using Swift and loaded it onto an iPad. The application is simply a switch in the center of the screen that appears upon connecting with the Arduino 101. The switch represents a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) characteristic. When the switch is off, it sets the characteristic to 0, and when it is on, it sets the characteristic to 1. 20 times a second, the Arduino does two things. The first thing is check the state of the characteristic. If the characteristic is 0, it shuts off its rear motor and stops checking for collisions. If the characteristic is 1, it turns the rear motor on and starts checking for collisions. The second thing the Arduino does is, as already mentioned, check for collisions. It does this using three ultrasonic sensors placed in the front of the vehicle. One of the sensors is facing directly in front of the vehicle, and the other two are angled to the left and right of the direction the vehicle is facing. If a distance is measured by one of the sensors that is considered dangerous, the Arduino will check the offset sensor readings for a clear path, and turn in the direction that gives it the most space.Demo of Driverless Vehicle to Vehicle Communication in an IntersectionThere are two cars involved in this demonstration. The first is the self-driving Arduino 101 powered rover, and the second is a regular, human controlled RC car with a raspberry pi and a GPS on board. The cars are placed away from each other and oriented so that they will both converge on the same point, like an intersection. I then remotely run a python script I wrote on the raspberry pi, which connects with the Arduino through bluetooth, and once connected, writes the vehicle's track angle to the bluetooth characteristic. Once connected, the Arduino starts moving, and the human drives the raspberry pi car into the path of the Arduino. After a delay of a couple seconds, the Arduino car reads its own track angle (the direction it’s moving) from its GPS and the other car’s track angle over bluetooth. The Arduino then decides whether or not the cars could collide. If a collision is possible, the Arduino stops and lets the raspberry pi car pass.Challenges I ran intoThere were so many challenges involved with carrying out this project, and some of the most difficult were not even software related!In the beginningI like to divide my projects up into individual tests that demonstrate the different technologies needed to complete the project, and then bring them all together. One of the first tests, reverse engineering the motor controller, proved to be quite challenging. Since the controller was designed to be controlled via a radio receiver, not much documentation exists as to which input produces which output. I had to sit down and write some test programs that looped through different analog outputs and tested different PWM pulse lengths in order to find which ones caused the motor to run at different speeds or spin in different directions.Simple electronics can sometimes be not so simpleProbably the most significant problem that took up entire days of work on this project was caused by the power supply. Initially, I discovered that the controller had a 5 volt output pin, supplied by the motor battery, and attempted to use this to power the vehicle components. However, I soon found out that with many sensors, a GPS, an Arduino, and a servo motor, the output was simply not powerful enough, and this caused a lot of weird behavior. After hours of fiddling with the hardware, I ended up using a USB power bank to power the Arduino, and using the motor controller output to power the rest of the vehicle. Since a lot of the power was used in outputting signals from the Arduino, this solution worked very nicely.GPS nightmareI used two Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout Boards for this project, and would recommend them to anyone else in a heartbeat. However, unfortunately, I found that my Arduino 101 hardware serial did not work with them, and I ended up having to write my own GPS library including an NMEA sentence parser in order to work with them. I was able to get them to work using SoftwareSerial, and I plan to upload my library and solution to GitHub in order to help out anyone else who may come across the same dilemma.AccomplishmentsCreating a Reliable Obstacle Avoidance SystemI started out just giving the rover the ability to dodge small obstacles in its path. Now, with my most updated code, the rover almost looks alive when weaving through an obstacle course.Demonstrating Vehicle to Vehicle CommunicationThe Arduino 101 powered rover successfully stops on analysis of data transmitted from another moving vehicle near it.I also found out some useful things about vehicle to vehicle communication. The intersection demonstration uses the track angles of the rovers to determine if they will collide. In a real world application, a more advanced system would need to be deployed, as explained below, since a system only using the two track angles has the potential to calculate false positives. Through tests of more advanced systems that used more measurements from the GPS and more sophisticated ways to calculate a potential collision, I learned a lot about this technology. 1) Bluetooth does not have the range to support this communication in full. Bluetooth also takes time to connect, and does not reliably stay connected between two moving vehicles even if they are in range.2) A more accurate method of location must be used in order to implement full collision detection in an intersection using more than just track angles. Either a much more accurate GPS is required, or more likely, an assisted GPS system possibly using cell towers.Why this is so:If the Raspberry Pi supported a larger bluetooth range, the vehicles could have been started at a greater distance from each other, and more information could have been collected up to the intersection, allowing for a more accurate collision avoidance calculation. I attempted demonstrations where the vehicles start out of bluetooth range, building up a history of data as they move, and connect once in range, but the bluetooth technology on board the Raspberry Pi had lots of trouble connecting the two vehicles while they were moving. I wrote an Arduino sketch that read both vehicles' latitude, longitude, speed, and track angle, and used their position history to plot their paths as lines on an Equirectangular Grid Model of the Earth. The Arduino then found the intersect of the lines, and used the two vehicles' velocities to determine if they would be at the intersection at the same time. This demonstration worked using test values, but the aforementioned limitations of the GPS and Bluetooth hardware led to inaccurate and untimely readings. In order to be utilized in a real intersection between two cars, these calculations would need to be supplied with data from an assisted GPS and a larger Bluetooth range.What I learnedArduino!I had never touched an Arduino before this project, and I have come to love how easy it is to automate things with one.C++Before this project I had worked with Java, Swift, Python, PHP, and SQL, but my past projects did not require any programs written in C++. Since the Arduino compiles C++, I learned a lot about the language, especially when writing the GPS library and NMEA sentence parser.NMEA DataIt was very cool to learn what most GPSs output, and how to interact with the GPS in order to get the information desired.Bluetooth Low EnergyI had always had a small fascination with bluetooth, and writing code that worked with it was very cool to me. I enjoyed how easy the Arduino 101 BLE API was to use.PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)I had used PWM in the past to control servo motors, but this project took me into the details of it. I learned the different between PWM frequency, duty cycle, and pulse length.What's next for Self Driving Arduino RoverStarting my first year of college in about a month, there will be many more resources for me to use in developing my projects. This will open up many possibilities to where this could go. I plan to continue developing the rover, adding different sensors to it and giving it new and improved capabilities. In college and beyond, I will use my knowledge of GPS, BLE, micro controllers, and more gained during this project to aid future efforts in making this planet a safer, more efficient, and more exciting place to live.Testing InstructionsContinuous Collision Avoidance ModePlace the rover in a fairly open area (such as a playground, backyard, gymnasium, etc), with at least 2 meters of space in between the front of the vehicle and the nearest obstacleSupply power to the Arduino by plugging in the cable attached to the power supply, and turn on the Electronic Speed ControlWait 5-15 secondsOpen iPad Rover Controller ApplicationWait for on/off switch to appear in center of iPad screenTurn switch on to start the back motor of the rover and enable collision avoidanceThe rover should start moving forwards and turning its front wheels left or right when it approaches an objectVehicle to Vehicle Communication Intersection DemonstrationPlace the driverless Arduino rover and the RC raspberry pi rover about 9 meters apart (try closer if the vehicles are failing to connect, the raspberry pi 3 has a relatively small bluetooth range)Orient the two vehicles such that they are pointing towards a common point, from directions around 90 degrees relative to each otherPlug the raspberry pi and the Arduino, turning the two devices on, and turn on the Electronic Speed Control on the Arduino roverWait until both GPSs indicate a fix (when the blinking red light on the GPS starts blinking much less frequently)SSH into the raspberry pi and start the intersection demo python programOnce the Arduino rover starts moving, using the Remote Control, drive the raspberry pi rover into the path of the Arduino rover, so that they are on a collision path and moving in directions around 90 degrees relative to each otherDo not stop raspberry pi rover; drive it straight through the intersectionThe Arduino rover should now stop and let the raspberry pi rover passNote: for both the sketches, the pulse length that determines the speed of the Arduino rover is defined by a C++ macro.

Such thing inspires us to solve the bad culture by developing an android-based application.During the development process, we investigate and discuss with those people who likes “ngaret” and found that there are two factors caused which is Internal and External factors. We define the Internal factor caused such as habit (or we call it previously as culture), laziness, and forget, while the external factors are traffic, accident, or natural disasters.Referring to the above factors, we assume that the main reason of the “ngaret” is “HABIT” and the only solution is moving on and realizing the negative effects if we do our activity “ngaret” instead of being punctual.

"Guru","A mobile app that utilizes live streaming technology to bring students high-class education in an effective manner","[7603, ""In today's world, there are experts in every field. Your neighbors, your best friends, people you see every day or those you have never met could be possible experts or at least knowledgeable in the field of your question. Instead of having to find clunky explanations online, search and filter through hours of youtube content, or even set up meetings with tutors days in advance to understand concepts, problems or doubts, Guru saves the day.  "", 'Guru is a native iOS application that utilizes live streaming instructional technology that instantaneously connects students with ""Gurus"" in an effective learning environment. If you ever had to ask a quick question or understand a certain topic, Guru is the app for you. You sign in to the application stating what topics you\'re comfortable teaching. You can either ask a question to a global audience of gurus or you can see a list of questions that students are asking related to your skills. Gurus receive instantaneous push notifications or in-app alerts that their presence is requested. When the guru accepts the student\'s question, they are both simultaneously taken into a Live Video Call, through which the guru can explain the problem. We have seamlessly integrated a collaborative whiteboard in the stream, allowing the guru to draw on the screen and explain difficult concepts.  ', 'Guru is a native iOS app backed with a nodeJS powered Parse Server, a popular open source deployment framework. We host our server on Heroku’s powerful infrastructure which allows us to easily deploy new server side changes via a git command line and manage performance in an integrated environment. For the client side languages, most of the app is written in Apple’s Swift 3.0 with Objective C libraries as well. Cocoapods was our dependency manager and proved to be very useful in organizing the external packages we used. For live video streaming/conferencing, we used Twilio to deliver fast and reliable content streams connecting the Guru and student. There is native Twilio code running in the app, as well as a server component hosted on our backend for authenticating users with the service before granting them access to a session. The real time whiteboard that is provided during a call is powered by the open source Live Query server project which facilitates web socket connectivity for efficiently sharing coordinate points across devices to create the effect a continuous line is being drawn live. A separate portion of our Heroku instance (dyno) manages this live websocket system. We use a MongoDB database hosted on MLab which has proven to be fast and very adaptable to our needs. ', 'Setting up the Live Video StreamAside from coming up with the idea for Guru (which took over 3 hours between all of us), we faced two main technical challenges. They consisted of implementing a video chat service in our app along with having a live whiteboard to draw on during a video call. At first, the idea of a video chat system seemed daunting and we researched possibilities of transcoding and delivering our own content across infrastructure providers such as AWS, but in the end Twilio was found to be a less difficult way to build out this feature while allowing time to focus on the app and interface. We coded a demo app before integrating video with the main Guru platform and divided up tasks such as researching various APIs, efficient server management with video, and designing/developing user interfaces for the product. Integrating a Collaborative WhiteboardWe thought this would be the most difficult feature, but as we soon found out an even harder task was to build the dynamic drawing system. This required setting up a continuous websocket connection to avoid unnecessarily polling a server for new points to download and wasting precious resources. Parse’s newly open sourced Live Query project was slightly complicated and had minimal documentation but after many hours we figured out how to receive subscription alerts for newly updated points and were able to complete this feature. There were many other smaller challenges such as how to properly assign and delegate tasks among our group, as well as when to sleep (if at all!), but we are happy to have a finished product and to have overcome these challenges. ', ""Guru is a near-complete application. We delivered on all our promises, a fully functional and instantaneous live stream viewer, a fleet of push notifications to alert Gurus of requests and the integration of a collaborative whiteboard in the live stream to ensure a better learning experience for the student. The fact that we were able to complete this in a mere 36 hours speaks volumes. We're extremely proud that we were able to get this far, to get this functional app that allows anyone, anywhere to connect with a guru who could be anywhere in the World and still learn valuable information with ease. Developing this app seemed impossible in the beginning, but one by one, as we finished off tasks and created features, everything came together in the end.  "", ""The most important thing we learned is team-driven collaboration and the division of tasks to ensure maximum productivity. With such a complex app such as Guru, it was imperative we all were on the same page, focusing on different areas of the application and tying them in at the end into one superb app. This meant raging through intense git merges, trying to manage 3 people working on the same Xcode project and resolving major conflicts that seemed impossible. At the end of the day, however, we did it together and that's what matters.   "", ""The future of Guru is unlimited. We plan to publish this app in to the Apple App Store and promote this app between high school students and college students alike. The use case for this application is truly present - any person who has a doubt, a problem or a confusion can post a question in a couple of seconds, and 5 seconds later be talking to a Guru who's walking the student through what he or she needs to do. We hope to engage in productive conversations with students and leaders in the education industry to see how Guru can be a fit for teachers and students alike, gaining tractions and pushing this app to its limits.

I found the Alexa Skills Challenge on Devpost and put my registration in. So, I created this AI based Doctor that gives a user his/her diagnosis based on the symptoms. I knew that there are no existing apps in the market for public use that even remotely gives the user a steady description. I did my research. This allowed my to think freely and move in towards building my code. Hence, I built Medical Assistant. I kept the name simple as it is what it's name sounds to be. "", ""Medical Assistant is a skill with the most user friendly voice interaction model. To keep the user interested and satisfied I kept the number of questions to a minimum and gave a more precise answer. I really had to work on a better user experience. The Skill takes the input from the user about medical conditions and gives them a description about it's rarity and severity along with which department of doctors they should go see. But the USP of the skill is actually the Diagnosis based on Symptoms. Based on the user's statement, the skill asks follow up questions till it reaches a decision and finalizes the medical condition the user may be having and then suggests it and also recommends which type of doctor they should go see. This is something out-of-the-box and completely different from anything that exists in the market. It has over 10,000 follow up questions and the content is completely dynamic. "", 'I build the code using Node.js where I used REST API services and a self generating code body for handling follow-up questions. I built the code through Jenkins and Deployed it to AWS Lambda. I used a simple Atom Editor to code and my testing environment was EchoSim.io and the App on Android Playstore called Reverb. ', ""The basic challenge was accuracy. Sometimes even Alexa fails to understand the exact user utterance depending on ambient noise , accent and network issues. My skill had to be reliable and precise so I had to add a secondary layer of Natural Language Processing on top of Alexa's existing Intent builders and NLP engine. I did this with over 1600 slot values and handling a bulk of individual string variations in my code.The second challenge was the probability counter. My skill, Medical Assistant only gives the diagnosis when that probability counter reaches over 97% for any medical condition. This was done by careful mapping of medical conditions with their symptoms. It took me almost 2 months just to do that. Eventually I cracked the code and successfully made the entire package up and running. "", ""The final product is something exactly the one I had in my mind and hoped to build. Getting something exactly right as it is in mind and looking at your code built from scratch running flawlessly is an achievement on it's own. I've even gone ahead and showed it to several doctors who were really hyped and happy about it. People are really happy I'm giving away such a skill for free where enterprises actually charge people money for something like this. "", ""Thanks to this Alexa Skills Challenge 2017, I also got the drive to learn something new. In this regard, I learnt Node.js, Express.js as well as Alexa SDK and about AWS Lambda's Serverless platform. These skills came very handy some interviews as well. "", ""Medical Assistant will grow with time. I'll keep adding more modules to it like Searching nearby locations via Google Places APIs and giving contacts of Doctors as cards in Alexa Companion App, An AI based Diet Builder based on eating habits as well as Binaural Music to keep moods in check for Mentally Challenged People. I do have a plan. If I win this hackathon, I'm going to build this entire package and use that prize money to have premium API Services and Libraries and still keep the Skill Free for the Public so that people get what the need and deserve, A healthier and a better lifestyle.

I have studied music technology about ten years ago, so I felt a bit rusty creating the loops, but It was a great opportunity to catch up with some of my old college buddies to run my ideas past them and to get their feedback.There is also a known issue that I have encountered where card text overrides APL on the echo spot. I used to excellent Slack community to confirm this was a bug, and not me going mad!

"", 'So many things, where do I start? I have definitely learned lots of new coding techniques, including how to debug errors, but probably the thing I have learnt most is how valuable it is to network, share your ideas with others, get feedback early on and then to hands on beta testing performed.

"ConnectOnCommute","ConnectOnCommute is solving the problem of loneliness and disconnection by facilitating interactions with strangers","[5334, 'I was inspired to create ConnectOnCommute after experiencing my own new tribe moment moving out to Boston. I found it very challenging to break out and meet new people, make new friends, and really feel like I \'belonged\' in my community here. After a few weeks of feeling increasingly disconnected from my environment, I decided to put on a namebadge that said ""Ask me about tacos"". Within the 4 hours I had been wearing the badge, 14 different people would jokingly walk up and.. well.. ask me about tacos. Before I knew it I was having a random conversation with almost each one of them. After talking to some other people about my feelings at the beginning of my journey here, I found that I wasn\'t alone in feeling alone. It turns out 48% of Americans feel lonely most or all of the time, and 52% feel that no-one knows them well. Our brains have evolved to need social acceptance in much of the same way that we need food and oxygen- and it\'s because of this that many studies agree chronic loneliness can be more detrimental to our health than obesity and equivalent to smoking a pack of cigarettes a day.When I got to #HackHarvard2019, I had spent a lot of time thinking about that experience and wanted to see how my team could use tech to help foster a world of more deep, meaningful connections. Social media does a great job maintaining friendships once they start, but there\'s somewhat of a gap in initializing that first conversation; ConnectOnCommute was designed specifically do promote serendipitous interactions with the people to the left and right of us, all across our community.  ', ""ConnectOnCommute acts as an initiator for new, random conversations in real life with different people all around you in your community. Sometimes all we need is an invitation; users turn their 'social mode' on when they want to connect with others. As they're walking around, if another person in social mode is within range, both users receive a 'nudge' that includes the other person's name and a topic of interest to ask them about. Once both people click 'connect', a new connect-record is added to each users personal log.  "", 'The front-end was created with angular, typescript, and bootstrap; the back-end was developed using C#. ConnectOnCommute is hosted on an Azure server. ', ""The initial idea for the app involved using nfc or bluetooth to gage the range for the popup. Without the experience that would typically allow us to develop this kind of feature, we had to get creative with how to track location in a way that was accurate enough and allowed us to set parameters- this involved math... a lot of math... by pulling the gps longitude and latitude coordinates provided by every google chrome browser, we had to use trigonometry, conversion formulas, and advanced algebra to calculate the distance of any two coordinate points, and make it so that only people within 100 meters of each other would appear on each user's screen. It was challenging finding a new and creative way to get beyond this issue, however making it work felt really good when it was done. We also ran into some other minor technical issues, with things such as asynchronous functions/operations, typical bugs, and of course our favorite: syntax errors.

While brainstorming ideas for such problem statements, we agreed there was potential for using natural language processing to analyze frustrations and complaints, using human-centered design principles to light the way. We began designing a way to provide hackathoners and businesses with problem statements so they can focus on what they do best - solving them.Out of this idea came Adroit, an easy-to-use reputation and sentiment analysis tool. We sought a project that would challenge us with skills and frameworks which are new to us, while also keeping human-centered design in focus.

We hypothesized that aggregating complaints from social media and analyzing their similarities could point to services that may need attention, indicating recent major customer concerns with the company.

I dreamed of something more Minority Report—an interface where I could just flick the air in front of me and the model would move. Something like this: Careful, Chief. Dig up the past, all you get is dirty.While things have gotten a lot better (touch screens), I'd still like a lean-back interface where I could contemplate the world while effortlessly spinning my models.And with CAD Viewer, I think I'm halfway (ok, 10%) there.

Three.js & some custom loaders (not written by me) take care of all the shading, mesh generation, and 3D stuff. Dat GUI tho!Color trackingUsing tracking.js, I setup a color tracker that targeted any magenta objects seen by my webcam.

I chose a very calm visual language where each task in the routine is represented by an image that reminds the kids what they need to do.

"NC.js","Machining on the Cloud with StepNC Data and MTConnect Data","[9419, ""When working with StepNC data our team realized that our project could be adapted to use real machining data. MTConnect allows our simultation to be used in much more powerful ways. We envision our project being used in various commercial applications to provide real time monitoring of several machines from one location. Through the use of this software, the efficiency of the manufacturing industry could also be improved by up to or exceeding 15%. The MTConnect data correlates well with STEP-NC data which is our team's main inspiration.  "", 'NC.js is an open source application designed tointerpret StepNC data and create a simulation of thedescribed workplan. NC.js has two options that allowthe user to either drive the simulation from a StepNC fileor instantiate a live viewing instance using a machinethat streams MT-Connect data. NC.js utilizesMTConnect data from a live machine to drive asimulation of the machining tool. Then, throughassociative kinematics, a machine or fixture can beadded to the simulation with correct movement inrelation to the tools. Real time machining informationcan be easily compared to the expected result, allowingmachining mistakes to be caught in process andcorrected, with the eventual goal of mistakes beingcaught before they happen. The current application is also mobile friendly so that livemachining simulations can even be viewed from anywhere by the people who needit most. ', 'The current setup of the simulation is an Okuma OSP-P300 on a LAN with the NC.js server.The Okuma feeds the MTConnect data to the server which then parses and uses it to drive thesimulation. MTConnect’s “PathPosition” tag is used to drive the position of the tool duringruntime, while the GCode block numbers allow us to determine the active working step anddisplay toolpaths relevant to the current operation. We also use MTConnect to determine thefeedrate of the tool. In the future we plan to compare it to the expected feedrate values forerror analysis. The backend uses Node.js and the frontend uses React.js in order to parse the MTConnect and STEP data that is attached to the live server.   ', 'NC.js has many parts that need to work together. Creating it requires learning the STEPNC library, Javascript, and understanding the machining process. If one part of the application breaks it affects every other component, making it hard to pinpoint the exact problem. This behavior requires everyone on the team to have an understanding the entire program in order to effectively add features or fix bugs. Adding an independent view of the geometry seems like an easy task, but required the way geometry is loaded to be refactored entirely. Another issue is that the underlying library is poorly documented and doesn’t always behave as intended. This means that when a problem arises it is difficult to tell if it’s a high-level issue, a low-level issue, or undocumented intended behavior.Accomplishments that we are proud ofSeeing the activity of a machining tool in real time allows for levels of oversight not otherwisepossible. NC.js enables supervision of an operation and confidence that tolerances are beingmet, without needing to be physically present for the machining of a part. Various tools can beused in the simulation in order to see if there will be any problems with a different size tool. Atool of the wrong size can be caught before machining begins by using the simulationenvironment to change what tool is being used on the machine.Because NC.js is designed to be web based it is possible for a part to be monitored anywherein the world. The software could be used in a commercial setting to prove the effectiveness ofnewly developed tools or optimized toolpaths.The largest possible benefit is in the potential automation of machining. Automaticallyensuring tolerances are being met could eliminate the need for human oversight.   Shown above in pink is some of the tolerance highlighting that is being done by NC.js as the Okuma is traversing each GCode operation. Tolerance highlighting will allow for the user tosee which of the current tolerances shown on the sidebar applies to the current workingstep.The end goal is to allow the user to change these tolerances and then save those changes toa new file. These tolerances also allow for error checking throughout the application to makesure that all operations complete correctly.Another benefit is the ability to view the geometry ,at various steps in the workplan, in aseparate pane. This will allow for STEP data to have 3D visualization that is before or after thecurrent working step being machined.The model shown above has annotations displayed throughout the model to show tolerances throughout the piece. The color data is also applied to the piece in order to give the user a better distinction between different parts of the scene. A workplan view is displayed on the sidebar to show the underlying workplan and all of the relevant workingsteps for each of the operations. The nested elements can be expanded to see the hierarchy of the workplan which is useful to machinists.The impeller model shown above has the bounding box of the tool and model highlighted. This box is used for many of the underlying rendering calculations. The impeller model also has some more intricate tolerances highlighted on the blades of the impeller which shows the potential of tolerance association with faces on a 3D model. The tools pane on the sidebar shows which tools are being used in the workplan.  Any tool that is defined within the workplan but isn\'t being used will be lowlighted in order to highlight important aspects to the user.The above shows the list of workingsteps, organized by setup. The simulation will pause in between each setup in order to simulate the need to change the orientation or tool of the machine. The toolpath is displayed and eventually a trace line to show any deviation will also be displayed.What we learnedDuring development we learned a good deal about web design with React components, as well as how to transition our simulation from using a preset path to the tool locations given by MTConnect. By saving state information at higher levels we are able to propogate changes to all components in a timely fashion. This enables all our UI elements to run in sync without losing information between transitions. Understanding how to read the MTConnect data took some time but proved to be a worthwhile time investment. The richness of the data allowed us to easily display all the relevant information. In addition we also were able to get important experience working as a team on a large code base, especially in regards to using Git as a source control tool. What\'s next for NC.jsFuture features will focus on statistical analysis and automatic detection of machining faults.Features that are currently being worked on include:Tracing the path of a toolProviding automatic calculations to determine possible deviations, detecting faultsbefore the entire part is machined incorrectlyComparing material removal to tolerances associated with each part faceThe ability for NC.js to make recommendations for feed rates and spindle speedsbased on optimization algorithmsVisually previewing tolerances, workpieces, and tools while the simulation continues inthe backgroundFurther goals are to allow for tolerances to be added or removed from a model using thesimulation. The end result can then be saved for future use with different tolerances than theoriginal model. We also want to generate recommended changes to the workplan based onthe differences between the simulation and the MTConnect data.

"NEATVIBEwear","NEATVIBEwear is a personal real-time noise exposure monitoring and logging device","[10008, 'Every day we are exposed to harmful levels of noise and don\'t even realize it. Studies show the adverse impact of sustained or prolonged loud noise on our health is not just limited to hearing impairment, but can include increased risk of hypertension, heart disease and stress. Annoyance, sleep disturbance and decreased school performance are also sufficiently attributed to noise exposure (ref: Passchier-Vermeer W, Passchier WF (2000). ""Noise exposure and public health"". Environ. Health Perspect. 108 (Suppl 1): 123–31. doi:10.2307/3454637). Additionally, in occupational settings there are tools that have been developed delineating high-risk noise exposure zones based on point source measurement, but there is a need for a cost effective personal noise exposure capture device used for data collection and visualization in real-time. Deployment of ten or a dozen NEATVIBEwear devices in a single factory/plant production area is more cost effective than procurement of one industrial noise monitoring handheld device. To reliably assess exposure to occupational risk factors it is vital to have estimates of where workers spend their time and how they spend it. The study of Time Activity Patterns (TAP) attempts to answers these questions.  Most time-activity studies for health data collection are written in diaries or entered in on-line surveys, which are inherently biased due to differing degrees of recall and accuracy in reporting (ref: Time Activity Patterns in Exposure Assessment, EUR 15892 Report, EC Directorate on Science., R&D, 1995). Some TAP studies now can be mobile device enabled, but few (if any) record real-time noise exposure coupled with time-activity data. Fitness trackers have similar functionality, but do not include noise exposure.  Collection of accurate, cost-effective real-time TAP and noise exposure would enable factory or plant workers to better protect themselves from risk of hearing loss and other noise-associated harms as studies show work-induced hearing loss is a result of repetitive high noise exposure and workers who are overexposed to noise are at risk for developing hypertension (ref: Assessing High Noise Areas, G.Battista, OH&S, May 2016).The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) within the Center for Disease Control (CDC) has established exposure limits for various decibel (dB) ranges, and yet most people aren\'t aware of their exposure to noise nor exposure at various noise levels.Although there are smart phone apps that can measure dB levels, these apps are limited as they can produce false and/or interrupted readings resulting from phone calls, texts and/or when the app is closed. Additionally, the Smartphone sampling rates may be constrained and battery life can be a concern as well. Finally, if the Smartphone is off it can\'t capture noise level information.Hence, a Noise Exposure, Activity-Time and Vibration Wearable (NEATVIBEwear) device!! What NEATVIBEwear doesNEATVIBEwear is a personal noise capture device integrated to a Smartphone (for the purpose of displaying information) giving users the ability to:View real-time noise exposure at a glanceMonitor and track cumulative noise exposure either on the NIOSH scale or broader ""Health Risk"" scaleSave summary exposure information to log noise cumulative exposure over timeReview and understand available information regarding noise exposureHow we built itNEATVIBEwear is an integration between a personal noise capture device built using an Arduino 101 with the Grove Loudness Sensor (with the potentiometer for adjusting gain and a wide frequency range) and Android Smartphone running the gaming platform Unity as it provides the ability to render a representation of the real-time sound in a 3D color coded simulation.

"Turnstyle","keeping score at every door","[10578, 'As college students, we found that we spent a lot of our time in lines--whether it was the line at the dining hall entrance, in front of the squat rack, or into the big basketball game.  While getting lost in some of these crowds is inevitable, a lot of frustration and waiting could have been avoided if we simply knew how congested these places were before we left our dorm rooms.  If we had a way to monitor everyone on campus, we could figure out when to head to the gym, find the ideal quiet studying spot, and determine when to line up at our favorite campus eatery.Of course monitoring everyone is not feasible--but perhaps we could get close.  We decided that all we needed to do was monitor all of the doors going in and out of each of these places of interest.  This would allow us to compute the population of our favorite places in real time -- and with this, help us plan our days better.  Ideally, we would like to have something to the effect of placing a turnstile near each of these doors.  However, conventional turnstiles are big and bulky, and no one likes having to walk through them everywhere they go.  Was there a way to do this in a less intrusive manner?We had previous experience using ultrasonic sensors and accelerometers in a biomedical devices laboratory in college, and we decided to combine these sensors into a more advanced occupancy sensor device. The Arduino 101 was simply the best device to develop on. The internal inertial motion unit, Bluetooth low-energy communications, I2C bus connectivity, Arduino community, and sensor module libraries all came together to produce a cohesive device for us. ', ""Please refer to our GitHub repo README for all instructions.An Ultrasonic TurnstileOur device is an IoT ultrasonic turnstile that records the number of people in a building or room by detecting when people leave or enter. It uses a combination of sensors that, to our knowledge, has not been used simultaneously in this way.  It allows us to help fight crowding and congestion in a non-invasive way, with no contact or interaction required by the people passing through.  It also detects movement in an anonymous way and preserves the privacy of the people it detects.Live UpdatingOur current build of the device streams population data directly to a mobile application and web application. Within a second of sensing movement in a doorway, it updates those applications and visualizations immediately. The speed at which this data is transferred improves the ability for further development of the device and the services it provides without appreciably reducing the speed at which it can deliver those services.  Furthermore, the Turnstyle can be used as a security feature if the door is unexpectedly opened -- perhaps outside of business hours.  Turnstyle seeks to serve both building managers -- in the form of a mobile application they can use to manage and monitor their Turnstyle --  and the general public -- with a widely available web application --  by providing both with valuable real time data.Powerful AnalyticsTurnstyle provides live population monitoring, helping people make educated decisions about where to head in the current moment.  It also provides aggregate measurements such as most popular times and general traffic trends to give people a general sense of how crowded places will be in the future.  We hope that the analytics that Turnstyle has to offer will help us better plan as a society and allow us to lead more efficient lives.  Just as people check the weather each morning, checking Turnstyle's data will encourage people to head to work at less busy times or eat at their favorite restaurants during slow hours -- saving us all from the pain of traffic jams, stalled roads, and wasted time.   "", ""Turnstyle UnitA magnetic contact switch is used in conjunction with the Arduino 101’s internal motion sensing to determine when the door opens.The precise angle that the door makes with the wall is computed using the Madgwick Filter.  When the door is opened beyond a threshold angle, the ultrasonic sensors on each side of the door start firing.  Depending on which sensor detects motion first, the directionality of people travelling through can be determined.The Arduino 101's internal BLE capabilities communicate with the mobile application.The Serial output of the Turnstyle is sent into a Node.js server to plot the results in real time.Any of these variables-- the threshold angle, the distance at which the ultrasonic sensors maximally operate, the directionality of traffic, can all be tuned to match the specific needs of each door. Real Time PlottingA Node.js server uses streams and plotly's streaming API to generate the plots in real time.  It parses the population data from Turnstyle's serial output and creates the plots on the fly.Mobile ApplicationOur mobile application is built using Evothings, a platform designed for creating IoT applications.  Evothings allowed us to write applications that could be run on Android, iOS, and Windows Phone in pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript.  We used Evothings's BLE libraries to allow the application to send and receive messages with the Arduino. "", 'We built an entire functional Android application on Android Studio, but it would only work for android 5.0 because of Bluetooth permission issues associated with 6.0+, so we had to scrap it and learn how to use Evothings in the span of two daysWe hit the API stream limit multiple times (at least 5) on plot.lyTwelve-hour time zone difference caused difficulties in testing and collaborating - two of us were in a different country for an entire month.Lots of difficulties getting Bluetooth to communicate in real time; we had no experience with it and had to learn a lot from the limited documentation. ', 'Using many features of the Intel Arduino 101 in our hack, including the built-in accelerometer, gyroscope, and Bluetooth modules.  We really felt like we were getting the most out of the hardware.Providing both an application and a web service for real time tracking and analyzing data - seeing how quickly our phones and computers responded to the Turnstyle was insanely satisfying.Inertial motion units are accurate within several minutes from baseline but have a strong tendency to “drift,” causing the device’s reported motion to be much different from its actual motion. This is troublesome in the case of tracking an object over a long period of time, but we were able to cleverly navigate around this by using the magnetic contact switch to notify when a baseline position in space was met. That way, “drift” over time doesn’t affect the device’s measurement of the door’s motion as we reset the drift to 0 each time the door is closed.Finishing without drinking any coffee ', 'Bluetooth is a lot more complicated than we initially gave it credit for -- we had to learn a lot about subscription models and UUIDs and the like.  It was also extremely difficult to debug, and the most unexplainable issues are often best solved by resetting the Bluetooth on the phone.Different versions of Android have different problems with Bluetooth -- we need to be more considerate of different versions of the same platform when developing future projects.All of Evothings and Plot.ly!  This was a great first experience with IoT, and we were surprised to see so many tools and technologies specifically designed for IoT projects.Each of us also became better hackers in general; other than Arduino, there was not a single technology we used for this project that all of us have used before! ', ""The biggest feature we have yet to implement is support for multiple simultaneous Turnstyles.  Since most large places have multiple doors, this is a very important feature.  Right now, we could probably implement support for a couple devices at a time (using BLE communication protocols and streaming Node servers), but support for extremely large public spaces (think museums and monuments) would require engineering for scalability.Building applications for specific use cases. For example, a building manager could have a monitor that tells them when to call in maintenance after a certain number of people have used the building, a more reliable metric for needing repairs as opposed to a regular time interval. Another example would be having a live update on specific websites of the number of people at a particular library, post office, or grocery store, so consumers can avoid long times and plan accordingly. A better detection procedure would be helpful; although the population counting is quick robust and accurate, it can be fooled, especially if someone is trying to intentionally deceive the detector.  A possible (but complicated) solution would be to use computer vision to identify faces, but this would defeat part of Turnstyle's purpose -- to be relatively cheap, mass-producible, and non-intrusive.  We would like to look into finding a happy medium between sensor overkill and cost.Creating alternate Turnstyles to accommodate different doors, such as sliding doors, revolving doors, or two-way doors.  You would be surprised by how many different kinds of doors are out there.

"Farmed","Harness the power of data to feed the world","[9425, 'One of our colleagues grew up on a farm in Iowa.  We wanted to see if we could mash up the USDA datasets to help existing farmers become more productive. As we undertook this challenge, we kept a few design principles in mind: keep the data local and relevant to farmers, and layer interesting data on maps to draw insightful conclusions. ', 'Our application maps your land and growth density data to identify problem spots and see how well your neighbors have taken care of their land, because you might be looking to expand your acreage. The rainfall and crop yield graphs reveal which crops performed the best in challenging precipitation years so that you can plan for dry years. ', 'We started with farmer interviews and data exploration.  We tried to see what questions actual farmers are asking that we could answer from the data provided by the USDA.  The number one issue that all of the farmers mentioned was water.  We decided to combine the USDA data with a dataset from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that contains precipitation and temperature data. Architecturally the application is built using using Javascript, Node.js, React.js, Dc.js, and the google-map API.  We use a combination of Bower, Node.js, and Gulp to test package and deploy the application.  We tried to keep the entire application client side to simplify testing and development.  We used github.com to host the source code during development.  The project is public for anyone who would like to look under the covers.Challenges We ran intoConstrained DataWe were constrained by the limited data in the datasets. For example, yield data was only available from the surveys that occur every five years. The activities data was not available in the granularity that we wanted and it is in the form of percentage of land on which each activity was performed over a year, rather than area-specific data about where herbicide was applied to specific plots of land.TimeGiven more time, we would have been able to implement visual details we had built into the planned experience using hi-fidelity wireframes that added an element of fun and polish, such as using a raindrop and leaf for the rainfall and yield graph.We would like to explore more external datasets and pull data out of them to make meaningful connections.  We would like to compare the temperature data from the existing NOAA dataset to yield data in the application.Behavior ChangeIn terms of behavior, farmers don’t have the time to create or maintain online presence, so despite what we learned about the need to share experiences more efficiently in a more targeted manner online, we would have had to tread carefully with such a solution. Additionally, many farmers initially decided to farm in order to get away from the computer. Therefore, any technological application we build has to distill the data into digestible and actionable chunks that require minimal time to analyze. Where possible, we analyze for the farmer and point out information of interest.ScopeSome of our most compelling ideas were out of scope for this project because they would have required us to use machine learning techniques to identify and recognize patterns from existing data and make recommendations for useful courses of action for the farmers. Other ideas, such as creating a social platform, would require building an active user base overnight.Accomplishments that we\'re proud ofWe reached a wide spectrum of farmers and began to really understand their workflow, motivations, and challenges.We addressed both the hackathon’s challenge and farmers’ needs:An important part of sustainability is keeping food production and distribution local. Our map-based application appeals to farmers by showing them exactly what is happening on their land and in the surrounding local community. The Farmed application helps them understand their land holistically, using history as a teaching tool, so that they can make decisions that support increased productivity.Weather is the number one challenge cited by farmers. Our application arms them with historical weather data that they can use to plan crops for projected drought years. It is flexible enough for us to add real time weather predictions for short-term planning as part of future work.The Farmed application focuses on a specific type of farmer and is designed with him in mind. We ensure that the farmer’s interaction with our application will be enjoyable and to the point.What we learnedAn Aging PopulationCurrent farmers are aging out, resulting in a loss of knowledge. The US may soon see a lack of people growing healthy food close to home. The US is losing farms at an alarming pace, and the majority of farm subsidies go to animal feed and sugar, not healthy food for people.Sharing ExperienceFarmers, especially the young ones who are just starting out, cannot easily support or learn from each other, but it’s important to them to be able to share information, new approaches, and advice on how to respond to different challenges. They need to make decisions such as when to plant and harvest, what crops grow well in their area, what works with regards to soil type and weather patterns, and how to deal with adverse conditions. Farmers primarily plan their crops by spending time researching online or they get advice by talking to other farmers at farmers markets. They would like to receive information in the moment, but people are busy, and finding the right person to talk to is all about being at the right place at the right time. One way to facilitate sharing would be to combine farm journals and weather data across people and locations. Finger to the WindWe are trying to quantify things people aren’t used to quantifying. These things usually go by gut feeling, such as gauging soil moisture. Everything is in the farmer’s head, and they make decisions based on their experience. Farmers learn from their mistakes by reviewing their farm journals. There is an opportunity to help farmers focus attention during critical times with alerts that then lead to recommended responses. We would like to add recommendations to the Farmed application in the future.SustainabilitySustainability, like the term ‘organic’, means different things to different people. To many farmers, sustainability means taking care of the land, growing the soil, and managing the farm in such a way that the farm is a closed system that sustains itself. To some, sustainability is about being able to feed the nation in an accountable way for many generations to come. To others, sustainability is about feeding the local community and maintaining a balanced personal lifestyle.What\'s next for ATS / EchoUser USDAAdd soil survey data over the vegetation density data.Add temperature data over the rainfall and yield data.Train the application to suggest varieties to grow and activities to perform based on past performance in certain conditions (e. g. what sort of nutrient level adjustments need to be made for certain soil types).Help farmers focus attention during critical times with alerts that then lead to recommended responses.Connect farmers to each other to share their experiences dealing with infestations and the weather.Connect farmers to arrange transportation to markets, and coordinate truck routes and deliveries, in order to reduce the environmental impact.A Walk Through FarmedBegin typing \'West Milford Road, Milford, NE, United States\' into the search box above the map.

Our map-based application appeals to farmers by showing them exactly what is happening on their land and in the surrounding local community. The Farmed application helps them understand their land holistically, using history as a teaching tool, so that they can make decisions that support increased productivity.Weather is the number one challenge cited by farmers. Our application arms them with historical weather data that they can use to plan crops for projected drought years. It is flexible enough for us to add real time weather predictions for short-term planning as part of future work.The Farmed application focuses on a specific type of farmer and is designed with him in mind. We ensure that the farmer’s interaction with our application will be enjoyable and to the point. ', 'An Aging PopulationCurrent farmers are aging out, resulting in a loss of knowledge. The US may soon see a lack of people growing healthy food close to home. The US is losing farms at an alarming pace, and the majority of farm subsidies go to animal feed and sugar, not healthy food for people.Sharing ExperienceFarmers, especially the young ones who are just starting out, cannot easily support or learn from each other, but it’s important to them to be able to share information, new approaches, and advice on how to respond to different challenges. They need to make decisions such as when to plant and harvest, what crops grow well in their area, what works with regards to soil type and weather patterns, and how to deal with adverse conditions. Farmers primarily plan their crops by spending time researching online or they get advice by talking to other farmers at farmers markets. They would like to receive information in the moment, but people are busy, and finding the right person to talk to is all about being at the right place at the right time. One way to facilitate sharing would be to combine farm journals and weather data across people and locations. Finger to the WindWe are trying to quantify things people aren’t used to quantifying. These things usually go by gut feeling, such as gauging soil moisture. Everything is in the farmer’s head, and they make decisions based on their experience. Farmers learn from their mistakes by reviewing their farm journals. There is an opportunity to help farmers focus attention during critical times with alerts that then lead to recommended responses. We would like to add recommendations to the Farmed application in the future.SustainabilitySustainability, like the term ‘organic’, means different things to different people. To many farmers, sustainability means taking care of the land, growing the soil, and managing the farm in such a way that the farm is a closed system that sustains itself. To some, sustainability is about being able to feed the nation in an accountable way for many generations to come. To others, sustainability is about feeding the local community and maintaining a balanced personal lifestyle.

When I switch BaseShield working voltage to 5, problems start. Although these sensors can work with 5V but I solved with trying and anlaysing. I also had a problem with connecting water sensor to Arduino 101 with LCD because LCD sticks when sensor is connected. So I used another Arduino. At last I think this is a problem for water sensor.

The C++ application then used this coordinate data to make decisions on the speed of both the motors, which was then sent to an Arduino over serial.  The Arduino maps this commanded speed to a usable duty cycle and sends a PWM signal to the motor controllers. ', 'Most of the challenges encountered with the project involved communicating between the computer and Arduino.  We needed to communicate over serial to the Arduino through the C++ application, and we managed to find a third party library that allowed us to send the serial data we needed.  We then had to format the data so we could 1) update the motors quickly and 2) make sure we had accurate data on the receiving end to ensure the Arduino interprets the computers commands correctly. In terms of hardware, we had no idea if the motors would even move the cart because in order to get cheap motors, you have to settle for no specifications about what you’re buying.  Thankfully that worked, and the motor controllers held up.  The Kinect has a proprietary connector that splits into data for to the computer over USB, and power to a 12V wall adapter.  We wound up taking our base 24V battery power, stepping it down to 12V through a buck converter, feeding that into a 12V car inverter that inverts it up to 110V AC, at which point the wall adapter rectifies and steps it down to 12V DC.The Kinect API also took some time to figure out, but eventually we were able to get data from it very consistently.

"AR Voice ML Ninjutsu Battle Simulator ","Our project bridge the gap between science fiction and reality, bring anime characters to life. Users get to reenact their favourite scenes and justus from the anime Naruto with their anime figures!! ","[5174, 'Simply put, our project bridge the gap between science fiction and reality. We are a group of anime fans who dreamed of anime characters coming to real life since our childhood. In the past 3 days, we made our dreams come true. Our AR battle simulator projects hologram on our favourite anime characters to bring them to life. We achieved two main goals: projecting hologram to bring our anime protagonist to live; casting Japanese ninjutsu in hologram form through ML Hand Sign Recognition. These used to be only items that exists in anime classics such as Naruto (an anime about Japanese Ninjas) , Yugioh (an anime about a card game that can summon virtual/real monsters), but today we brought them from the 2D display to the 3D world.  A small step for 4 anime fans, a giant leap for the anime community. In addition, the anime industry is a huge untapped market in the west. According to Hollywoodreport, the revenue of the anime industry in 2017 was 19.1 billion USD. The industry is full of figure collectors that are more than willing to pay for innovative anime merchandise. Not only is our project a major breakthrough for the anime community, it is also potentially extremely profitable.  ', ""The battle simulator is a game where two players brawl off in the battle of Naruto ninjutsu hand signs. Each player has an anime figure. When ninjutsu is cast, the effect is projected on the anime figure as a hologram. The machine learning model can identify 12 unique hang signs from the anime Naruto and different anime cards. Each ninjutsu consists of multiple hand signs.

We build the machine learning model using Keras and tensorflow. We trained the model with custom dataset with 15k images gathered during the hackathon (it took a long time). At the same time, we also worked on creating a front and backend connection to host the animations and hold the game logic. We utilized flask for the backend and used react for the frontend.Challenges WE ran intoWith flask being single threaded (python in general) it was difficult for us to maintain or plan for multiple thread usages, something node would do great. However, tensorflow and keras has such a great python community that we chose to stick with it. Accomplishments that WE are proud ofWe set out a grand vision at the beginning of Hack the North to build a hologram AI battle dome. The objective was difficult and grand in nature; however, we were able to achieve it in the end. It is more than a minimum viable product, it represents the hard work and the constant trial and error during the 36 hours of Hack the North. What WE learnedWe learned to decrease the scope of the project when time and resource constraints are major issues. Machine learning, text to speech, web development, and hologram. Needless to say, we were ambitious. It is as if we are building 4 projects side by side instead of one. We learned that to achieve this grand vision, we had to decrease the scope of the project and use helpful APIs to do different components. We decreased the number of consecutive hand signs from 5 to 2; we used an API called Voice Flow to build the voice controller instead of building it from scratch. All of these discussions helped us to achieve our end goal.   What's next for AR Voice Control and ML Hand Sign Ninjutsu Battle SimulatorThe next step for the AR Voice Control and ML Hand Sign Ninjutsu Battle Simulator is to build a version of it that works for a smartphone. We already prototyped the hardware for the hologram display, all that is left is an innovative idea for the software components.

I'm a Third Year CSE student and always loved to explore and experiment with the technology around me. Voice is the next big thing in the industry with over Millions of AI enabled voice assistant devices already in the market. This is my first skill using APL and I hope it results out good. Didn't have much time to develop as my academic work was also there, but still I'm happy with my end results. Inspiration for this skill came to me from daily foodie desires. I always ask my mom to cook me something new everyday, but we can't decide what to make half of the time. "", 'So I tried to make a skill which provides me a random recipe made using ingredient which I ask. I have also included a feature in which it will just give out a lucky & trendy recipe name which we can try.It uses an external API to fetch the names of the recipes and related information and then I relay it out to my users using Alexa.You can ask it to give recipes made using cake etc.I plan to include step by step instructions along with visuals in future updates of this skill.

I live in India, so I'll try to bring regional dishes also to the skill. Also instead of an external API, I'm planning to build up my own AI model which can generate new recipes from available ingredients ( It would be a very nice experimental feature) Also Planning to provide step by step visual instructions to follow the recipe in the near future.Thank you!

"Beat The Opponent","Beat your opponents or learn from them, both way you win.","[5027, 'Amazon Alexa being a voice first interaction device/platform, and a session based (speak/listen/reply) kind of usage pattern, there are limited things you can do with it when it comes to kids. It boils down to a ""ask question, expect answer"" kind of a platform. As a developer/designer, we would innovate in how we ask the question or how we make the kids feel (using a storyline), as that is under our control . This was my thinking process while thinking of an idea for this hackathon. A very obvious choice came to mind, A QUIZ. No surprises there. But the number of trivial quiz skills in the Alexa skills store is overwhelming. A very simple guess for the low ratings of such skills is that it does not innovate in the ""ask question, expect answer"" pattern. It just blindly follows it.I thought about many other skills, and all required the use of echo show to make it \'actually\' fun to use or play. What I ended up with is  :A skill that would not ask:Only Geeky questions (boring for one and fun for the other)Only Math questions (enhance calculation skills)Only Game Of Thrones questions (make it fun for the start and boring after some time)...etc. (I think you got the point there)Moreover, I wanted to add a human touch to it so that the kids not only interact with Alexa but many others like Alexa. For example, if I am playing with an opponent (not a real one), I would not like Alexa to just tell me that this is your opponent, you will be competing with it. I would want the opponent to talk to me in some way so that I don\'t get bored with random opponent names. ', ""The skills name is 'Beat the Opponent' (Sorry for the boring name there). It is an interactive quiz game for the kids which has multiple levels and different opponent for each level. The themes are different for each level. For example, the first level's theme is on Superheroes where you will be playing against an opponent named Rick. Rick will introduce himself to you (not in Alexas voice but his own). And there will be a connection between Rick's introduction and the level's theme. So as one might expect, Rick is a superheroes fanatic, he likes to watch Marvel/DC/etc. Every level has 10 questions, and the skill keeps a count of your score (right vs wrong). At the end of the level (10 questions), it will compare your score with Ricks and tell you whether you won or not. If not, Rematch!, or Proceed to next level! Another example of a theme is 'audio-based'. In the 3rd level, you will be presented with sounds of a turkey, campfire, beating eggs, a man speaking Chinese and other cool things, for the kid to identify and pick. See I told you, not so boring after all.I don't want kids to take it as a quiz (because if they are even 1% like I was as a kid, they would hate that word, though they might have fun playing it.). Also, You would not hear a kid say to others on the playground about how a quiz is badass. THE BEST THING?Please try it on echo show and you will know it.

One can listen to music or watch videos with their family members, even when not together and still share the love.

"Baby SmartGate","A smart baby gate that alerts you when you accidently leave it open!","[5316, 'We have an 8 month old daughter who just started to crawl so I installed a baby gate at the top of our stairs to prevent falls.  The problem is, making sure it\'s always properly closed can be difficult, especially for new parents like us.  You can forget to close it because you are in a hurry or not bother closing it because ""I\'ll just be gone for a second"".  And sometimes you think you closed it but it didn\'t latch properly.  I designed the Baby SmartGate to solve these issues and increase the safety of our home! ', 'The Baby SmartGate uses a reed switch to detect if the gate is opened or closed.  Once the gate has been opened it turns on a red LED and starts a timer.  If the gate hasn\'t been closed in the allotted time (in this case, 10 seconds) it starts a procedure to alert those nearby.  For 8 seconds it starts beeping and increases the LED brightness.  Then for another 8 seconds it further increases the LED brightness and beeping intensity.  Finally the LED starts flashing and the buzzer is at full blast.  Hopefully an adult will notice and close the gate!When the gate is closed it briefly turns on a green LED to let the parent know it is secure and then goes back to sleep.The idea is that the alerting will help ""train"" the parents to always close the gate and make it a habit.  Without an alert it would be easier to become lazy with the gate, which is often what results in accidents. ', ""The design was fairly simple.  I opened up the latching parts of the gate and found that a cylindrical reed switch fit perfectly into both sides.  The magnet part of the switch fits in the swinging gate and thus doesn't require a power source.  The other side of the switch connects to the Arduino 101 which has a rising edge interrupt setup on the pin.  I also connected an RGB LED and active buzzer for visual and auditory alerts and a button to allow me to mute the buzzer if I need the gate opened for an extended period of time.When the reed switch is closed I put the Arduino 101 (Curie) into a sleep state to conserve power.  When the switch is opened it fires the interrupt which starts my state machine to go through the various alert levels.  I also used the CurieTimerOne to create an interrupt driven PWM on the buzzer pin to simplify my beeping routines. "", 'There weren\'t many challenges with the core design but I did run into issues when trying to improve it.  First the library I used for the Curie sleep and interrupts is not ""official"" yet and has some issues.  I wanted to use PM.sleep(x) durations for my alert level timers to conserve more power but they were causing weird behavior.  Also, to eliminate the need for constantly checking the state of the switch in the state machine I tried to use normal interrupts but was having issues with detaching and reattaching the Curie sleep interrupts.I also experimented with adding the CurieBLE library to send a message to the user\'s phone when the gate was opened but the connection would always get lost when I put the Curie to sleep even though the Curie datasheet says BLE should be able to operate when the SoC is sleeping.  The firmware for Curie seems to still be in development in this area so I dropped this idea as I wanted this to be a battery powered device and needed the sleep state to work. ', ""Mainly I'm just happy that this project helped improve the safety of my home for my newborn daughter.  A recent study showed that every 5 minutes a child in the US falls down the stairs and is sent to the emergency room*.  If something like this could help prevent just one child from falling down the stairs it would be worth the incremental cost to existing baby gates. "", ""I hadn't used interrupts or state machines before in Arduino code so that was a good learning experience.  Also, I'm happy to have learned just how low Curie's power consumption is while in sleep which gives me ideas for a number of future battery driven projects. "", ""I need to do power calculations to see how long it could last on a battery as it would not be feasible to have this plugged in.  Also, I would need to find a Curie board with a smaller footprint than the Arduino 101 so I can mount it easier, preferably inside the existing gate, or the whole thing should be put in some type of enclosure for safety and aesthetics.  I'd also like to get the BLE working with the sleep states and find a cheap BLE gateway it could communicate with to connect to the internet and send text messages when the gate has been opened for too long.I'd also like to look into a simplified version of this using just a 555 CMOS timer.

Both from the designer’s point of view and the one servicing them, it is an excellent idea to be aware. The mission is to reduce the problems faced by the drivers because of air loss in tyres. IoTyre is an Air Pressure Monitoring system which has a sensor that is installed in the vehicle near its tyre and monitors the tyre pressure. If a pressure loss occurs in one or more tyres, the system automatically shows this as a warning in the Iotyre Dashboard. Since an incorrect tyre pressure increases the braking distance, can impair cornering and can cause tyres to heat up, this automatic monitoring is intended to increase driving safety and prevent accidents. The driver also no longer needs to perform manual air pressure checks and is informed immediately about any tyre pressure problems.   ', 'Once the user installs the sensors near the tyre of his vehicle he has to monitor the air pressure through the IoTyre  application. The sensors will check the pressure using distance formula and give the user the percentage of air pressure there in tyres.  It will compare the baseline value of the pressure which is calculated initially when the air is filled into the tyre. Then the user will get the current air pressure in the tyre in the application and if the air pressure is less than cut off value i.e. it’s too low then the user gets the SMS notification through the application that the tyre are not in the good condition and need to fill with air. After every hour sensor will send data to Amazon IOT through MTQQ protocol automatically and update the values of the air pressure in the application so that the user gets the latest air pressure of his vehicle tyre.

"SMS Chat Messenger","An app that allows Sending and Sharing of Sms Text Messages and Media Files powered by Whispir.Io","[6362, ""When I interview some Business companies that  uses SMS as their main ways of communicating their business endavour to their clients,customers etc. The response I got was that SMS could have been the best optionagainst Email Messages, if there is a way to Store, Warehouse  SMS Text Messages and Multi-Media Filesalready sent to their Customers devices,desktop applications for future retrival,Editing,Resending and for other purposes. Proffessor Mike Filler in my school who owns a Shopping Mall also Point out that SMS text Messages seems to be a use and throw away data and thus does not store data unlike Email while some Business specialist in my vicinity  who owns Butticks, Large Supermarkets, Agriculturist etc complainsthat their customer services recieve thousands of SMS text Messages in a day and that scrolling of the phones in search of SMS,sorting of the sms text Messages and Media Files in order to be able to respond back to their customers is time consuming andsometime absolutely impossible in a high traffic SMS reception environments.Dr & Mrs. Richard Moore who owns a construction Company where I did my Industrial Training as a IT. Scientist points out that itstrue that SMS is faster than Email in terms of real time messaging but they still need to have all their SMS Messages storedsomewhere in the could as a data where they can get it anytime anyday. He also points out that the SMS Messages should be senton 1-to-1 basis(ie Peer to Peer sms text messagings) with caging process that prevent for instance  prevents User C fromhaving access to conversation that exist between UserA and User B.My Dad points out that if an SMS app could be built to meet up all the functions above,it will make the app most suitable in Ticket System because since sms is a realtime messaging protocols and the app also provides one to one SMS Chatcommunications, it will make tracking of Messages,complains, issues etc on Tickets System very easy on each Users(Customers)Uniquely.What I  Learnt from Inspiration and Interview aboveI have seen reason why many companies are using Emails as means of communication with their customers and Clients as oppossedto using SMS which provides faster realtime messages. I also learnt that:A.) Every Company, School, Organisation needs their SMS Data/information to be stored somewhere in the cloud whereit can easily  be retrieved,edit, further process or even resend. 2.) I learnt there is a need for communication contuniuty especially in Tickets System where a Customer ask or sent a complain and the issue has to be tackled my sending a follow up messages in real time.3.) I also learnt that a company can have more than 1 million customers and there is a need to have to 1-to-1 message exchange which only SMS peer to peer technology can provide.4.) Many More ......What is on my mindSMS Chat Messenger is a messaging service built on sms technology Powered by Whispir.IoThe More I looked at Whispir.Io technology, the more I think of Whispir SMS not only as way of sending just text messagesand Media files to users devices but also as a database for data storage(Eg. For Schools, Companies, Transportaions, E-commerce etc.).Thinking of it as an SMS Chat messenger. I apply the ease of mobile messengers to Whispir SMS's protocol,thereby creating a universal communication platform available to anyone with an mobile number. (as opposed to Whatsapp/FB Messenger closed networks)What I builtAn app that allows Sending,Re-sending,Tracking and Sharing of sms text messages, Multi-Media files eg Photos via Peer to peer(1-to-1) sms ProtocolsEg. between one user and another, between a company and its clients etc.How to use the app1.) Create one time registration using your mobile contact and then login.2.) Sending and Sharing of SMS Text Messages and Media Files can be accomplished in 3 ways stated below:A.) Search the user you want to sms to from the search box using her mobile number or names. once the user is populated,click on the user and navigate to the users profile to start sending sms via 1-to-1 sms chat protocol.B.) You can also send SMS by clicking on Add People Button, select the User you are looking for and start sending smsC.) You can also send SMS from your friend list.To do this you can either search the user from the search box via mobile no, names etc or click on Add People to send friend request to that user, when the user acceppts your request, He or she automatically appears in Friend list and from there you can start sending SMS and Multi-Media Files.click on Load More Button if you need to load more friends..3.)SMS Alert Components keeps track of SMS Notifications that were sent to your devices. You can reply sms messages sentto you using this option.4.) SMS History: Keeps timely Tracks of all the SMS text Messages and Files you sent to your friends, customers etc. It provides with option to edit, resend and delete already sent SMS text Messages and Files.What happen when you sent a File(Eg. Photo) to Recipients via the app.The files get sent via the SMS Chat System immediately so that the recipient can see it if he or she is online. But because its an uploaded file not just a text message, whispir does not currentlyhave a way of sending the files directly to recipient devices. So what the app do is to send the files full link to the Recipient devices via WhispirSMS. The recipient can then download the file by typing the link on a browser or by clicking on adownload button withinthe app (SMS Chat Messaging System).Integration:The App can easily be integrated into social network, businesses, Transportations, Agriculture,Schools, E-commerce, Tickets System etc.ChallengesBuilding a Peer to Peer(1 to 1) SMS Chat Technology is very hard to accomplish. combining Files Sharing with text messagesis hard as well. Online and offline presence of each user is also hard to accomplishAbout Whispir TechnologyI have tested both Whispir Voice, Email and SMS API and found out they are easy to integrate and awesome.Their Engineers are professionals who knows their job.Built Withwhispir-smsTry it outfredcare.com      Submitted to    Whispir: Make Your App Talk    Created by  deleted deleted "", ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['whispir-sms']","False","11","","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/309/746/datas/small.png","True","8"

"Artisell - Indian culture revisited","INSANELY INTUITIVE two-way marketplace for buying and selling of handicrafts &amp; goods. Artisan Awareness is the aim.","[7873, ""On the highway from Maharashtra to Gujarat, I met a lot of Artisans selling their clay pots and various other crafts on the Roadside of the National highway.The quality of their goods were very high and they were beautifully made but astonishingly they were selling at negligible rates! The reason is - they have the skill but not the means to showcase it well enough.India has a very diverse and unique handicrafts culture that is slowly fading away due to 2 reasonsLack of discoverability for artisans (to sell their products)Lack of consumer awareness (People just don't know about the beauty these artisans create!)We aim to solve this issue through our 2 sided marketplace and artisan awareness app - Artisell.Note: You may argue that there are a ton of eCommerce players trying to tap into the Rural Artisan community and sell their products online. But all of the apps (Flipkart, Myntra, Snapdeal, Limeroad) have horrible experience and expect that you are an expert in English, and the flow of mobile apps and various methodologies. Just go to Google Play and see the screenshots for any of the seller apps. They are the most difficult to use apps out there - as they ask 100s of things before you can really upload a product. Our apps primary aim is to make every single artisan be able to use the product from the get-go and requires little to no training in use of content systems. Also, the unique image and tag based search algorithms make it easy for buyers to search for products without having to know any unique SKUs. "", ""'Artisell' aims to be a 2 way marketplace for buying and selling of goods made by rural artisans - handicrafts, clothing, traditional footwear, paintings, clay pots, etc. Artisans can directly sell their products and buyers can buy directly and post custom job requests for artisans.Simply, there are 2 apps involved in Artisell. The seller app and the buyer app.The seller app is meant for Artisans, and has a UNIQUE, SIMPLE, and INTUITIVE user experience catered to users who are laymen and have little or no knowledge of using smartphones. The USP of the seller app is that in just a few simple steps and careful guidance (through voice, imagery and animations), the Artisan can operate the app with little to no traning. Apart from this, the seller app has following features (All built with usability in mind)1. Add product (4 steps -> Select category, Type or Say product name, Upload image, and Add Price)    - Here automatically our system generates tags based on the image uploaded    - For every step there is visual cues and the artisan can press a button to HEAR a voice clip explaining what to do    - Incase there is no internet the product is stored offline and sent to server later2. Accept Job offers    - Any user/buyer can push job requests through the seller app. These can be viewed, reviewed and accepted by artisans3. View nearby Artisans    - The Artisan can view any nearby artisans in a list and map view - and one tap call them for any sort of query or discussion they might want to have    - Artisan can view his own profile as well4. View Events/Melas/Fairs    - Artisans generally look to attend various fairs and events to sell their goods. A lot of Artisans miss out of the opportunity due to lack of information.     - Both a list and a map view5. View products    - Grid view of Artisans products    - Can be tapped to see detailed view of the products6. Switch languages    - With one tap the whole app can be toggled between HINDI and ENGLISH!The buyer app on the other hand, is also a unique and simple buying experience for customers (primarily wholesalers) to buy products directly from the artisans.Features include1. Search Product by IMAGE    - Upload an image and similar products will be displayed by our app2. Search Product by KEYWORD3. Search Product using Filters - Price, Quantity, etc.4. Create a Job Request    - Buyers can create job request which contains some sort of task they would want the artisan to complete    - Buyer sets the budget, approximate delivery date, description and OPTIONAL image to support the display    - On approval of any job request by any artisan - the buyer will be notified with the details of the artisan5.

The user is given 2 choices in the chrome extension: apply an Adversarial Patch to his/her image or evenly distribute Adversarial Noise across the image. For the Adversarial Patch, the extension adds a patch on the image provided that causes a general object recognition classifier to misclassify an image.[2] The patch is made by applying expectation over transformation, over a random area of the image. For the Adversarial Noise, the extension makes quasi-imperceptible changes to the image such that a machine learning model classifies it incorrectly by using a single gradient ascent step, also know as a ""fast gradient sign method"".[3] While both approaches typically require a known existing neural network architecture to compute their adversarial attacks, a.k.a. a white box attack, they have been shown to work well on black box neural network architectures as well.[3] Text input is converted into an image before applying the Adversarial Attack.

Blocker performs less effectively against some adversarial defenses, e.g. Robust Optimization and Certificates.[4] To overcome this, we can apply 2nd-order gradient information in our future work to generate better-performing adversaries against these defenses. One feature that we did not manage to fully implement was a Universal Adversarial Attack to pre-compute and transform the images in a O(1) constant-time operation for the adversarial step.[1] However, this comes at the expense of less robust A.I. Blocker. Other than improvements to the Adversarial Noise approach, there is also room for improvement for the Adversarial Patch approach. One such improvement can be the use of clever geometry to blend the patch into the image more seamlessly, such as an Adversarial Frame around text.

How many of those people automatically check Airbnb as their default without ever comparing hotels nearby? While many people assume Airbnb has the lowest accommodation prices, in many places hotels are actually cheaper and/or provide a better experience than renting an Airbnb. We\'re deal hunters at our core and we wanted to make travel planning easy by enabling multiple sources of travel data in one place to get the best deals and experiences with the least amount of effort while planning the perfect dream vacation or that recurring work related trip. Enter Air Compare - the one stop shop travel planning Chrome extension that allows users to:• Compare hotels near the Airbnb listing they\'re considering • Get average car rental prices based on when you’re renting a car• Get estimated ride sharing (Lyft) prices to their destinationsWe wanted to provide users with the best accommodation deals but more importantly, we also wanted to solve the ""last mile problem"" (getting people from a transportation hub to their final destination) as it relates to travel. Often transportation costs end up adding up significantly and it’s difficult when planning a trip to estimate those costs ahead of time. We wanted to bring transparency to this area so there’s no hidden surprises when it comes time to travel, only #unforgettableexperiences. ', ""We've built a seamless, multi-faceted Chrome extension that gives users peace of mind that they're getting the best deals while saving them countless hours of searching multiple different sites and apps (because each hour saved is another hour to watch funny cat videos #priorities).  At its very basic function, Air Compare will automatically populate hotels within an Airbnb's vicinity and in a similar price range (+/- $50) and users can filter by distance and price. Users can also review each hotel's amenities so they can make the best choice based on what's important to them when travelling, with a point of comparison against what Airbnbs offer.For those more sophisticated travelers who like to plan in advance (my Virgo perfectionists, I'm talking to you!) and know their itinerary, they can go to Add Trip Details to enter in a destination address (such as their client's office or a tourist destination they'll be visiting) and also search for car rental and ride sharing prices to/from their destination.Air Compare allows users to:Compare multiple hotels near the Airbnb listing they're considering with information on:Distance from the hotel to the Airbnb with the ability to sort by distance or pricePrice per night Hotel amenities (users can compare the Airbnb amenities with hotel amenities to determine what's truly important to their trip; a hot tub time machine may be crucial when scaling Mount Everest but not so crucial on a Safari adventure in Africa)Filter and sort by rewards points and/or price for programs like the Starwoods Preferred Guest loyalty program without having to check yet another siteDetermine whether renting a car or using ride sharing is the better choice:Get average car rental prices (based on the nearest airport the Airbnb is closest to)Get Lyft estimates from the airport to the Airbnb AND each nearby hotelGet Lyft estimates and travel times to a destination for both the Airbnb listing AND each nearby hotel (because we're overachievers like that!)Users can now compare at a glance how much their car rental vs. using ride sharing will cost without guessing or doing any extra work  "", 'DataGridJavalinOpenJDKKotlinNode (Scraper)JavascriptChrome extensionSabre APILyft APIAmadeus APILufthansa APIGoogle Geo APIFuelVideo demo of the technical features: https://youtu.be/KncPJEdiSSg.

"Aristotl","Acessible Academic Assistance","[6892, 'When conversing in group chats with other students, I noticed that many people often posted homework problems that they needed help with. However, often times their questions went unanswered, or the answers they got were unhelpful. That lead me to the idea of a more ""conversational"" academic assistance service - a platform on which students can easily ask bite-sized questions and instantaneously receive answers.I was inspired by HackHands (acquired by Pluralsight in 2015) and CodeMentor (which has raised $3.4M to date), both services that introduced this model to the programming community. I thought that the same model could be applied to other subjects, and so I created Aristotl.Note that while the web app is primarily targeted towards students for now, it could very easily be converted to instead be a platform for technical support, or for job training questions, etc. The sky\'s the limit!  ', '(Check out the demo video above!! :) ) Note: in the demo I was already signed into my Okta account through google, so it didn\'t actually redirect to the google account chooser. The social logins do work, I promise! Feel free to test them out for yourself.A student, needing help with a question, registers for Aristotl - either with an email/pass or with a Google/Facebook account. After entering their information and purchasing credits (for now, just a proof-of-concept - no payment necessary!), the user can converse with an intelligent chatbot that will diagnose their problem. The chatbot can generally determine the subject without being told specifically what it is; ie if a user inputs ""I can\'t do this integral"" it\'ll correctly classify it as a calculus problem. After conversing with the chatbot the user is directed to upload an image of their problem, then is redirected into a private room.The ""tutor"" can then enter the private room and converse in real time with the ""student"". To help illustrate certain concepts, the teacher & student can draw on a collaborative whiteboard component, which updates in real time using websockets. If necessary, either the student or the teacher can initiate a video call with the student by pressing the camera icon.There are a few more features under-the-hood... here\'s a full list:FeaturesReal-time chat with websocketsReal-time \'whiteboard\' component that teachers can useUser can edit data such as gradelevel/biography/account type for better classificationSeparate dashboards and user types (one for students, one for teachers)Students initialize their problem by conversing with an intelligent chatbotChatbot uses NLP (Google Dialogflow) to determine intent and subject of the problemSentiment analysis using the VADER modelEmoji picker for user-to-user chatrooms  (:D)Credits system (perhaps some business viability there... but just a proof-of-concept for now)History + auto-saving feature, allowing students to re-open their issue if need beImage uploads + storage w/ GRIDFSSMS updates for students when they\'re offline but their question receives a response Optional Audio/Video calls - with a cool draggable container!

(2) OpenCVTaking the image, we use OpenCV to perform feature detection and clustering. We then progressively generate a MIDI file by determining the location of key musical objects and assigning them pitches. (3) MIDIFinally, we pipe our fully created MIDI file back to Android, where you can play it right in the app. The total process takes between 5-10 seconds. Challenges we ran intoOn the mobile end, we wanted to make the application target Android 10. This meant carefully navigating various privacy demands that were both scarcely documented, and completely new to our team's developers. Meanwhile on the back end, it was tough performing feature detection and filtering out noise with OpenCV. Accomplishments that we're proud ofDespite the barriers we faced, our team is proud to have created an end-to-end application with so little time. We are also proud to have had such attention to detail, even going as far as to implement complicated animations just to open a dialog in Android. What's next for CapriccioTry out Magenta!Magenta is an open source Python library that explores the role of machine learning in the process of creating art and music.

But at the end of the day you want to have a solid idea, a great team, and also find a way to get to that hackathon. That's what CodeCollab does.  "", ""CodeCollab is a platform for hackathon attendees all across America to post their next greatest ideas and form teams. Users can view the hackathons they will be attending, see the different ideas that other people have posted and join/make teams. If you have an idea of your own for a hackathon, you can add your idea to a list of ideas and specify who you're looking for, and how many members are needed in your team. Also, since a main issue for <16 high schoolers is how to get to events, ride-sharing with other hackers, including your teammates is utilized. "", ""We started off with a Google App Engineer Server, written in Python to parse the MLH.io website and get the data of hackathons that were needed. The iOS app was completely written in Swift 2.0, Xcode 7.2. We used a Firebase backend to save the users and hackathon data, what ideas/teams they're in and more. We utilized MapView and GeoLocation to get routes and places of different users going to the hackathon.   We also created a web app that could list the hackathons and allow the joining of teams.  We also plan to add facebook integration so that people can contact their teams via facebook messenger. "", 'The biggest problem CodeCollab had was the integration of Firebase, and getting the information from the GAE to the iPhone app. It took us an extensive amount of time to get Firebase up and running, almost giving up at one point because Cocoapods was giving us numerous issues. The problem with GAE was that since there was so much information, the app loading time ranged around 20 seconds, and the parsing was done haphazardly. Last but not the least, we had some major trouble when it came to using the MapView with the geotags of the ridesharers.

"DAI Daddy II (Uncensored)","DAI Daddy is an autonomous, open-source platform for unwinding Maker CDPs.","[5072, ""14% of Maker CDPs to date have been forcibly liquidated. When this happens, the ETH held as collateral in the CDP is automatically sold at a 3% discount to pay off the CDP holder's DAI debt, and on top of this a 13% liquidation penalty is applied.When ETH prices drop, many CDP holders can't afford to top up their CDP with ETH to prevent liquidation; but often, they don’t have enough cash to buy DAI close their CDP. So even though they may still be collateralised at over 150% (i.e. they have sufficient assets to pay back their debt), there is no way to effectively close their CDP and pay back the debt.How can we allow these users to close their CDP without paying a hefty liquidation fee? Introducing... DAI Daddy II (Uncensored) - an autonomous platform for unwinding Maker CDPs.For the product video see here.For a demo video of interacting with the dapp see here. "", 'v2.0 of the DAI Daddy platform builds on our work with $dai daddy, a CDP debt marketplace where sellers can list their CDP for sale and offer a ""discount rate"".The new version maintains this buy/sell functionality, but adds a new primary feature: unwinding CDPs. Under this model, rather than requiring a counterparty to ensure a CDP is repaid, the new DAI Daddy smart contract withdraws collateral from the CDP, uses Kyber Network to convert this ETH to DAI, and then pays off the CDP and returns the remaining ETH collateral to the owner.The number of withdraw/repay iterations required depends on the collateralisation ratio of the given CDP. The lower the ratio, the more iterations are required. Because this process follows an exponential curve, v1.0 of DAI Daddy is used as a backup option for CDPs whose collateralisation ratio is too low to leverage the unwinding process. ', 'DAI Daddy II (Uncensored) works by transferring the ownership of a MakerDAO CDP to the DaiDaddy contract which then executes the unwind process. At that point the ETH collateral in the CDP is transferred to the original owner, minus the debt owed on the CDP and any transaction fees.The value of the CDP is calculated by looking at the underlying collateral and debt associated with the CDP. These values can be found by querying the MakerDAO Single Collateral DAI (SAI) tub contract which acts as the SAI CDP engine.Using these values the total value of the CDP can be found by finding the difference between the underlying collateral and debt. DAI Daddy enables you to extract this remaining value once it pays off the CDP debt. ', 'We realised that due to the constraints of the MakerDAO smart contract system, we needed to take the user through 3 different transaction confirmations before being able to unwind their CDP. This presented a challenge from a UX perspective, but we made it as fun and non-disruptive as possible.We had some issues with optimising animations for different screen sizes, which was compounded by the fact that our front-end devs are still new to Vue.js (which we’re using to make Web3 integration easier).Smart contracts to talk to all these systems are really hard!

This app is for everyone, including the people who don’t like to use internet or the one that are bored and want to spend there time on something fun. This app is like an mental exercise because you have to think how to solve the puzzle and you have to think ahead where are you going to move the next block in-order to solve this puzzle.

Everything was set but the coding was difficult, we had to assign everyone to work on something.  ', 'This App Helps you or challenges you to solve a puzzle within certain timing and moves. Well the App lets you decide by pressing the object to move to an empty space.  You’re challenged to solve by beating your own highscore.

You have to look ten moves ahead to be able to this puzzle. ', 'The Fun Puzzle is built with Mit App Inventor.  I used buttons and placed images on them for sliding images. The image does not slide in reality it switches with the button next to it if it is an empty image present. It counts the moves when you touch the buttons. And the lowest moves is actually the high score. I also used 4x4 Puzzles for that I decreased the size of all the buttons and added a new column and row at the end. When the app approves that all images are in place it shows you your highscore. ', 'The challenges I ran it to were mostly about the programming of the app. I didn’t know how to code some things in the app but after a lot of research about it I was able to overcome the challenge. For example I didn’t know how to randomize the puzzle, it took me two days to find how to randomize. Sometimes the app crashed and I had to search the whole code to look for the problems. It took time and patience to overcome all of the challenges. ', 'The accomplishment that I am proud of is that i was able to make this app and and solve all the problems in it.

If your mailbox is compromised, one of the first things that happens is a filter is setup so the victim has no idea the hack has happened.  After that you're sending out spam or viruses to all your contacts until one of them calls you. Also emails containing a virus or phishing attacks can come from trusted contacts. They might make it past spam filters, and other virus monitoring systems. A second-line of defense is needed, monitoring what actually arrives in your mailboxes.An early warning system, monitoring your mailboxes for threats is a great idea.  But it must alert you via a different channel than email... A text message. "", ""v-snitch Monitors sent email and sends a text message to alert you if you have been sending out spam. This is an early warning system, after compromised.v-snitch Monitors received email and sends a text message to alert you if you have actually received a known threat, from a bad sender or matching a known bad message pattern.This is an early warning system, before compromised.All alerts are logged.No emails are stored, ever.No meta info is stored, ever.All email integration is securely done by our friends at Context.IO.It takes 2 minutes to setup... then you're done and let the servers monitor your mailboxes in the background. "", 'This was a fun project that started out as a good idea, and evolved into a very compelling application.  One that I would use personally and professionally.The application pattern is: ""sign up, and configure"" via a web-application interface.  As such, to build it I used my favorite web-app toolkits... MeteorJS (node, mongo, handlebars, etc)jQueryBootstrap (less)etc.And of course packages to integrate the public APIs I used:ContextIOTwilioThe publicly available repositories for Context.IO integration were a great start, but just Meteor wrappers for the excellent NPM package for Context.IO.  I chose to make another, simpler, wrapper for Meteor. zeroasterisk:contextio-simpleFor Twilio the Meteor package I used was accolver:twilio-meteor and it\'s implementation was super simple.Wiring APIs together is pretty easy, but deciding on an architecture which allows them to be coordinated and orchestrated was a bit trickier.  I eventually landed on a plugin structure, where I can add extra internal packages for each type of message scanner I want to implement, and since they have a consistent interface, stacking and running them is simple.I have the full repo available on GitHub, and I\'m happy to share privately, if you\'re interested... ', 'I thought it would be easier to get security threat dictionaries, to flesh out my threat scanners... but I have not found many.  I will be looking into finding more in the future and more importantly, setting up a partnership with a security company to get on-going updates.NodeJS is great at async queries, which do not block the main process thread and do not timeout.  Meteor mostly runs inside fibers and thus is largely synchronous on the server, within a process call.  I have run into complication trying to get Meteor to let loose and be asynchronous, which is important for long-running API request, followed by many iterative actions on each result from the API request. ', ""As a result of this project, I created a pull request to the NPM package for ContextIO to fully implement an API which is documented but missing from the package.The application itself serves as a useful tool in it's current state.  A great proof-of-concept, and a reliable security monitor, easy to setup.With a bit more effort (see the roadmap) it may evolve into a game over tool in the sysadmin's toolbelt.  Once we find a security group with the right kind of top grade security scanning to wire in... the application goes from pretty cool, to gotta have it. "", ""Learning what Context.IO can accomplish is a pretty big lesson.  It's a tool to access emails - a resource, which has traditionally been very difficult to coordinate, especially when you think about different providers.  Organizing most email providers into a single API and normalizing data structure takes 90% of the work off my shoulders.

"Facebook Powerchat","Supercharge your Facebook messenger.","[4772, 'Everyone spends hours on Facebook Messenger from chatting, to collaborating on work, to sending links, and to sharing photos. What if there was a way to super-charge your Facebook Messenger and make these tasks even easier and more integrated into the Facebook Messenger experience.  ', 'We implemented a bunch of new features into Facebook Messenger that will take your Facebook usage to the next level. For better collaboration we created an interactive canvas inside a chat. Users will be able to whiteboard their ideas with their friends without ever having to leave Facebook.We can stream local videos from one user to the other through Facebook allowing for instant sharing without the manual tasks of uploading it to Youtube or Drive before hand.Using the Chrome WebAudio API we have integrated voice commands into Facebook Messenger. At the tap of a button, users can speak to Facebook and have their text displayed on the screen. For those users that love the sharing aspect of Facebook, we created tools that allow you to share content much faster. Using the commands /giphy and /youtube, users can search through Giphy and Youtube for content that represents what they are feeling when words can\'t.How We built itWe attached an event listener to every element in the html hierarchy and used the react-id to get message text. From here we just associated specific message commands delimited by "" / "" to get the commands.We inserted custom css by injecting it with content scripts by reverse engineering the hierarchical and reactive structure of Facebook\'s Messenger page. This includes the canvas, the extra button functionalities, as well as anything we pushed directly into the chat.For our canvas, we used Socket.IO to create unique rooms using the Facebook IDs of users that we received from the self-referencing profile account: facebook.com/profile.php?=73322363. From here we had access to our own vanity, our user-id, as well as all of our recent chat history which we could scrape for information about other users. We went through the page to find the ids and used them to add elements to the messenger-thread.Challenges We ran intoAs we were modifying elements on Facebook\'s Messenger.com, it was difficult to see past the obfuscation created by ReactJS - it required a lot of trial-and-error testing and reverse-engineering. Sending http and websocket data within Facebook also proved difficult, as we were required to use SSL and TLS-enabled sockets, and had to deal with CORS and other cross-origin-related headers. Deploying on Azure also proved difficult originally: we experienced problem with a compiler dependency of a concurrency library for Python/Flask. We ultimately switched to an Ubuntu Box and successfully configured NGINX to handle both SSL and TLS sockets.We had an additional RESTful server deployed to Heroku. Early Sunday morning, however, several Heroku data centers experienced significant problems, preventing us from deploying: we ultimately transitioned to a VM on the Google Cloud Platform, which solved our problems.Accomplishments that I\'m proud ofWe are very proud of how much we finished because of the huge amount of obfuscation that Facebook has on their messenger page.

"PillAR","Your medication digitized","[3152, ""A couple weeks ago, a friend was hospitalized for taking Advil–she accidentally took 27 pills, which is nearly 5 times the maximum daily amount.  Apparently, when asked why, she responded that thats just what she always had done and how her parents have told her to take Advil.  The maximum Advil you are supposed to take is 6 per day, before it becomes a hazard to your stomach.  PillAR is your personal augmented reality pill/medicine tracker.It can be difficult to remember when to take your medications, especially when there are countless different restrictions for each different medicine.  For people that depend on their medication to live normally, remembering and knowing when it is okay to take their medication is a difficult challenge.  Many drugs have very specific restrictions (eg. no more than one pill every 8 hours, 3 max per day, take with food or water), which can be hard to keep track of.  PillAR helps you keep track of when you take your medicine and how much you take to keep you safe by not over or under dosing.We also saw a need for a medicine tracker due to the aging population and the number of people who have many different medications that they need to take.  According to health studies in the U.S., 23.1% of people take three or more medications in a 30 day period and 11.9% take 5 or more.   That is over 75 million U.S. citizens that could use PillAR to keep track of their numerous medicines.How we built itWe created an iOS app in Swift using ARKit. We collect data on the pill bottles from the iphone camera and passed it to the Google Vision API. From there we receive the name of drug, which our app then forwards to a Python web scraping backend that we built. This web scraper collects usage and administration information for the medications we examine, since this information is not available in any accessible api or queryable database. We then use this information in the app to keep track of pill usage and power the core functionality of the app.Accomplishments that we're proud ofThis is our first time creating an app using Apple's ARKit. We also did a lot of research to find a suitable website to scrape medication dosage information from and then had to process that information to make it easier to understand. What's next for PillARIn the future, we hope to be able to get more accurate medication information for each specific bottle (such as pill size).  We would like to improve the bottle recognition capabilities, by maybe writing our own classifiers or training a data set.  We would also like to add features like notifications to remind you of good times to take pills to keep you even healthier.Built Withapiararkitaugmented-realitybackendflaskgoogle-visioniosmobilepythonscrapingswiftTry it outgithub.comyoutu.be      Submitted to    PennApps XVIWinner                PennApps XVI Second Place Prize                  Created by  Avery LampMaking stuff is funRyan SullivanArlene SiswantoYasmeen RoumieTinder | Snapchat | NASA "", ' ', ""We created an iOS app in Swift using ARKit.

"Drugmatic","Drugmatic is an educational VR immersive experience to help teens fully understand the effects of drugs.","[4425, 'Drugs have always been a serious problem especially for the younger generation. Unfortunately, most of teenagers started their journey with drugs because of curiosity. So how might we help them get away from drugs with respect to their curiosity and imagination? What It Does""Drugmatic"" is a virtual reality drug experience focusing on teenagers. Based on research of true feelings after taking drugs, teenagers will have a taste of the illusion. During this experience, they will also have chances to make a change, and to stop this dramatic wired and fake world. Once a decision is made, there is no going back. Fantastic or horrifying, they have to go through the entire illusion by themselves. By the end of this experience, they will realize the unpredictable result of drugs.How We Built ItWe started this project by exploring the VR drawing tools Tilt Brush and Quill VR in order to draw an illusions of drugs. With this VR experience, we tried to rebuilt the scene where this event happened. Player could make their decision by themselves using leap motion.Brainstorming and Problem definitionIn order to decide the concept, we did a brain storming session. At first we thought about several ideas but in the end we made our mind to dive into a drug experience.ResearchFor us, it\'s very difficult to recreate an experience without a real reference. Thus we started our project by doing some research about what illusion would be like after taking drugs. We looked at some articles, videos and movies, decided to create the entire illusion world based on the research.StoryboardIt took us a lot of time on the storyboard. We hoped our player could enjoy the fancy part of the illusion but also the scary side. It\'s very important to let our players know that the illusion of drugs can lead you to a horrible world with the most scary result you may never have a chance to regret.Style and DesignDuring our research, we found out that there are a lot of common things of drug illusion such as higher color contrast, fluid and strange world, strange physical contact...These changes reminds us of hand-drawing. We decided to use Tilt Brush and Quill to build the world and animations. We also wanted to have some interaction for our players in the illusion world.Programming and Exporting AssetsThis is the time when everything started to become messy. We watched a lot of tutorials, tried a million times how to export our drawings into Unreal Engine, learn how to build animations...The process is bitter but it\'s also a fun journey. Challenges We Ran IntoDevelop a solution to explore the world of drug effects based on research.Integrate Tilt Brush assets into different graphics enginesLimit time and resources to create an educational experience which depends on high quality art pieces.Accomplishments that We are Proud ofSuccessfully bring Tilt Brush VR painter into the whole creation work flow.Build an incredible illusion world.InteractionNatural hand movement instead of traditional controllersCreate your own illusion by hand drawingChoose your own adventureIncorporate taste and touch into own VR experienceWhat We LearnedDrugs may make you high for a moment, but the cost of the illusion will be extremely high, too.New creation toolsTeamworkTime Management is important Some toolkits are not compatible!!

We thought this was really cool, and wanted to learn how to make our own oscope demos! "", 'We created a few different applications that allow you to use the oscope in unique ways.Sound LabSound lab is a gui that lets you explore how sending different sound signals of your own design to the left and right audio channel produces different images in the oscope.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HbPvv330osDrawingDrawing extends the idea of sound lab, but lets you draw any image using your mouse and keyboard, and the image will show up on the scope.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ69lpM5Rr4PongPong lets you play pong on the oscope!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d9cI9621eUArbitrary Images (Attempted)We tried to use edge detection to get arbitrary images to display on the oscilloscope. ', 'In order to draw on an oscilliscope, you need to put the scope into ""XY"" mode. This mode takes the audio output from two channels (left and right), and plots the channels against eachother. For example, if you had a cosine wave on the x channel and a sine wave on the right channel, the oscope would display a circle.You can kind of think of the sounds being created by the laptop as parametric functions with a timestep, so with all of these projects our goal was to produce audio on the fly based on these parametizations. To make developing so many apps easy, we created a library that can take any line and produce a waveform that looks like that line on the oscope. By playing the noise for a bunch of lines in succession, you can draw any arbitrary shape.To produce these waveforms, you just take the normal line equation y=m(x-x1)+y1, and parametize it.So on the y channel your waveform would be the function y(t) = (m(x-x1)+y1) * sin(t) and on the x channel you would output x(t)=(m(x-x1)+y1) * cos(t).This library powers the Pong game, we just specified the two paddles and ball using these lines, and created waveforms that we can modulate to move them around on the screen.We also used this library for the drawing app, but with modifications. It would be way too slow to generate a sound for each pair of points in the drawings the use makes, (if we take too long to draw the screen, you can an awful flickering effect). To combat this, we used a line combining algorithm to make an approximation of the drawing entered by the user, reducing the number of points needed significantly. ', ""The oscope refresh rate is lower than we expected, so the sampling causes sharp edges when we produce square waves. This can be seen in pong when looking at the corners of the paddles, they are slightly rounded because of this effect. We also needed to run a simplification algorithm on the lines we were trying to render in the drawing app. Also, my Macs sound driver does automatic output equalization to stop your ears from being destroyed by sounds that wouldn't normally be conducive to listening to, but as a result, as the position of content on the screen changes, the oscope position drifts when my mac is used. This took us a long time to figure out, as we thought it was our softwares fault. Switching to the surface book fixed our drifting issue. Finally, the image app proved to be difficult. Edge detection is fairly straightforward, but producing a set of lines to display and scheduling them in an optimal order proved to be very difficult. We were able to get some stuff to show up on the display but it looked like scribbles.

Some of us don't like to ask questions in class when we don't understand, and some others just fly through material. Ideally, we would all have personalized assessments and homework to help us. However, normal standardized schooling often overlooks this possibility as it takes a lot of time and effort for teachers to put together customized work for every student they teach. Edumame is the solution to this ever-occurring problem.  "", ""Edumame is an educational platform that gives students control over their education by catering closely to every student's individual needs. This is done through the analysis of a student's performance in different subjects during online assessments and the teacher's input. After assessment, teachers are then able to analyze their class and understand where students struggle and are strong. Edumame then gives teachers the ability to create work assignments, homework and exam papers that are aimed at giving students more practice at the things they struggle with while at the same time helping to maintain their strengths. Through the Edubase, teachers can input topics and receive many types of questions related to those topics in which they can choose to export to pdf to use. Edumame also offers a social platform that allows students to post questions and receive help from their peers in advancing their learning. Through voting and answering questions, Edumame provides the perfect environment for every student to have the same chance at success in a much more augmented way than just traditional learning.

"DECAF","Decentralized car sharing made fun","[5380, ""Car sharing services are predicted to grow more than 34% until 2024 and by then we are talking about an USD 16.5B market. We evaluated various services and not a single car sharing service today really connects to you. You enter the car, go wherever you want and get off the car. It's not fun. People are changing from ownership to usership, but these services are not as fun and immersive as they should. Volvo proposed us to find a way to gamify the car sharing service and Swisscom challenged us to create a platform that performs a digital representation of an asset as a data-bound utility token that can be used within our platform. Our solution is both DECAF and VOLT, which work together to provide the people a decentralized car-sharing platform that makes our inner gamer smile.What does it do?DECAFDecentralized car sharing made fun is an Ethereum based platform that provides car manufacturers a way to enter the car-sharing business. Manufacturers add cars to the network and receive tokens for doing so. The more cars a manufacturer adds to DECAF, the more tokens get distributed to the car maker. These tokens are then given to users based on use-time, using services for multiple days in a row, achievements and quests. DECAF tokens are, by definition, backed by cars.How can you win tokens?A user may win tokens and XP by requesting and using a certain manufacturer cars, by completing certain quests or unlocking achievements and each time you level up you win tokens. The tokens you receive can be given by more than one manufacturer, depending whose quests you completed, or by the time you used each brand's cars. There are also special quests which give XP as well as tokens.How to spend your tokens?Tokens can be spent to enhance UX. They can then be used to get discounts on the platform, free experiencies like museum visits, or discounts on an oil change. Discounts or vouchers of other services that want to partner with DECAF can also use our tokens. For example, a restaurant or a zoo might want to offer a discount for certain tokens for the exposure it will have in our platform.SocialWhen you request a car, you have the option to tell the platform where you are going. If another person is requesting a ride to go the same way, you can both accept sharing the car to devide the expense. You can see each other profiles and see their DECAF feedback, level in the game and if you have the same interests. If you are using a car with friends that use DECAF, everyone would win tokens and save money.  DECAF also makes you compete with your friends or people in the same area to get on top of the usage leaderboard. You can win extra tokens for being a regural user, making many kilometers and spening a lot of time in the service.VOLTVolvo token is how we imagine a car manufacturer implementing on top of our platform. The company will add cars to our platform that can then be requested by our users. They can also add quests and achievements to be completed by the users to improve UX by gamification and make people want to use their services over their competitors. If a user levels-up in the game, Volvo will give them tokens to award them for their fidelity by offering VOLT, the same being true if a user completes a certain special Volvo quest.This app adds fun and rewards to car sharing, making car sharing a service people will love to use.Check the Ethereum Smart Contract.   It was published to 0xbbd49bd432dc262838f7bb0ce41506c8374c2d12By developing on top of DECAF, Volvo will be the pioneer and fullfill once again their legacy of innovating and focusing on the user.How do we feel about our project?We developed a smart-contract based on Ethereum Blockchain. While we didn't accomplish all of our objectives, we learnt a lot about decentralized platforms that run smart contracts (ETH and NEO Blockchain), and HyperLedger Fabric platform, and how to develop on top of them. It was our first time building something on top of blockchain platform, so we were very happy with our progress and with what we could present in the end.   The Volvo companion app was made using web technologies to be easy to port between devices. We used HTML5, CSS and Javascript to make a user-friendly and fun web app. We aimed to build a car dashboard but time ran out on us.   We feel like, in general, we learnt, coded and had fun during the cooking of this project.What's next for DECAF?If we receive a positive feedback from Volvo and Swisscom we plan to build a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and to crowdfund this project through an ICO of DECAF.Made with <3 by ProtoTripeirosTry it outgithub.com    Created by  Developed Ethereum Smart Contract and Business ModelJoão  Cacho SáFind me at LinkedinWorked on the VOLT App, gamification strategy, and integration with the smart contractCarlosANovoVOLT companion app and integration with the smart contractFrancisco Pimenta Developed Ethereum Smart Contract and   business plan Elias FerreiraStudent of Electrical Engineering FEUPTelmo Ferreira "", ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'If we receive a positive feedback from Volvo and Swisscom we plan to build a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and to crowdfund this project through an ICO of DECAF.Made with <3 by ProtoTripeirosTry it outgithub.com    Created by  Developed Ethereum Smart Contract and Business ModelJoão  Cacho SáFind me at LinkedinWorked on the VOLT App, gamification strategy, and integration with the smart contractCarlosANovoVOLT companion app and integration with the smart contractFrancisco Pimenta Developed Ethereum Smart Contract and   business plan Elias FerreiraStudent of Electrical Engineering FEUPTelmo Ferreira ']","","False","20","['jcacho', 'carlosanovo', 'franciscofpimenta', 'eliasferreira', 'telmoferreira']","https://firefly-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/usercontent/fill/242/161/cGhvdG9zL3Byb2R1Y3Rpb24vc29mdHdhcmVfdGh1bWJuYWlsX3Bob3Rvcy8wMDAvNjA3LzI0OC9kYXRhcy9vcmlnaW5hbC5wbmc=/Decaf.png?signature=acff01a405e9455fa9450eab2ce5adddc91f0ffc","False","0"

As an initial test, we implemented the well known Wisconsin Card Sorting Test in order to help with an earlier diagnostics of Alzheimers where the user interacts with the robot through voice commands while his/her feelings are also analysed. At the end of the session, our system is able to generate a full report that can be sent directly to medical doctors, hospitals and carers. Also, since we have access to the patient's exteriorised emotions, the robot could be able to better deal with several common day-by-day situations, fighting back depression, loneliness and helping with simple tasks as remembering to take the medicines.Challenges we ran intoThe integration between several different systems as Pepper, IBM Watson and MS Cognitive Systems was our biggest challenge.

"Alexa Massage Manager","Massage Scheduling and Management Services Customized for Visually Impaired Specialists ","[9797, 'Women Who Code Taipei is a 600+ people community. We often host free technical workshops to learn different programming languages. When we saw this competition, we invited Young to join us because he heavily relies on voice to communicate to the world.Young is a part-time visually impaired massage specialist and a coder(believe it or not). When we started to brainstorm the project scope, we asked what his main challenges in his daily life are or what would really make him happy if we could use voice control system to help relieve some of his problems. At the time, he never interacted with Alexa, nor would he know its capabilities.Rachael Pai at our team is a certified Alexa Skills expert. She brought her Alexa and Echo and showed us how it interacts with us ""in English"" at the first team meeting. Oh...right, we can only speak English to make it work as of now. Then Emily Chang, YR Cheng- our UX designers started to draft the user story, recorded a few pain points on what Young faced when he conducted massage therapy with customers. For example, he often has problems with checking on the time remaining to arrange the steps of the spa accordingly during the massage session. He also would not have a way to know when the next customer will be at the door because appointment system is not in place. Sometimes, he has problem collecting the right amount of money shared with the massage store owner based on his service time and customer requests. So we want to help him and many other visually impaired massage specialists to have a scheduling/management services done via the communication with Alexa. During the hackathon, we consulted WWCode Twin City Director- Sarah Olson and Caitlin Collins to know if we could use google calendar api to make reservations. Our front end developer WeiYi Yang and Rory Lin then worked on creating the dashboard view for store managers to count the accurate sessions and start/end time of each session. Young helped backend data to feed to our dashboard on http://www.iams.tw/ ', ""Massage Manager has 3 main functions: Activate a Session:  include the start of the music after confirming the pincode and notify the remaining time(a different ring tone during the session);Stop:  For music to stop or End Session: For a session to end and send the accurate end time to our database** Count Total Sessions for Each Specialists: ** for profit sharing/management purposeEstimated time spent per session is recorded at the management dashboard here:http://www.iams.tw/ so the store managers could double check if there's a conflict between the predicted session end time and the next appointment time to make proper arrangement.We also created a booking website for customers to make appointments by selecting the types of services and specialists they specified: https://siphodsalexa.wixsite.com/massagemanager/book-onlinehttps://siphodsalexa.wixsite.com/massagemanagerHere is the message manager architecture. "", 'We recruited the team from Women Who Code Taipei network:https://www.facebook.com/wwcodetaipei/posts/1211773198950381?pnref=storyEach team member has specific function and we are glad we get to resolve a real problem for one of our team members as well as his community. ', ""As most of us don't have visual problems, we spent a lot of time observing how they use the baby timer/alarm machine (https://www.google.com.tw/search?q=%E5%AF%B6%E8%B2%9D%E6%A9%9F+%E7%9B%B2%E4%BA%BA%E8%BC%94%E5%85%B7&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi54OP-l-TTAhXJppQKHZRFD4IQ_AUICigB&biw=1440&bih=710#imgrc=eA9aJf1u9TwreM:), a timer that can notify the end of a session for these specialists. But we saw they constantly need to press a button to know what's the time now and the remaining time during sessions(imagine you have essence oil on your hands), it's really disturbing to the specialist and the customer.Another thing we found out is, the idle time is long. Some specialists are available right now but they don't have a way to notify their customers or the managers can't really access their calendars to know when/how to make instant arrangements. They also could not know each other's capacity or a way to have income distributed evenly among the specialists on duty(if they want). With limited time and resource, we could only make very small MVP for this competition but it will need to address the solution we proposed to resolve Young's problem. "", ""This is the first Alexa skill created from a pure Taiwanese team focused on a topic that is very unique to Asia. A lot of visually impaired people are trained to be massage specialists in Taiwan(probably a special industry in Asian culture). From a research we found out, 38% visually impaired people have jobs, 1/4 of them are massage specialists. On average, they can serve 6 customers a day, the income in cash could be up to $200 USD/day. (The minimum monthly income/month in Taiwan is ~USD$750).Even though we could only use English to communicate with Alexa, there's potentially a big market if we could expand the services to multiple languages in various countries and it has a great value add to improve the lives of the people serving in this industry.Imagine if we could have echo in each room at multiple massage stores and customers can make appointment from their location to a nearest store with a confirmed available next agent/specialist name and accurate appointment time they enter into a store. We will resolve unemployment program and potentially make visually impaired entrepreneurs more successful.Here's the Alexa skill that has been approved for public use:https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dalexa-skills&field-keywords=massage+manager "", 'YuRongI\'ve never thought of how the intelligent personal assistant could influence our daily life until I experienced it.

I think Young has much more potential than he thinks, his attitude toward hardworking is really unimaginable.我學到最多的是團隊合作的威力、如何有效溝通、從做中摸索學習的過程、當山不轉人就要轉、以及了解延攬人才的難度。我覺得Young比他想的有潛力太多哈哈，他的認真程度實在不敢想像。YoungI think as long as you work hard, coding is not hard.

As a massage specialist, you are tired after a day of work but you sleep well.After experiencing Alexa, it is recommended that Amazon must focus more on the position of Asian market. Alexa is really good and very suitable for our massage work, but it can only speak English, it will have its well-selling phase if he can speak Chinese.我覺得寫程式只要認真點努力一點應該就可以寫出來，但參加這個團隊不只是自己獨立作業，最重要的是有夥伴的資源，因為很多東西都是要靠夥伴一起完成的，例如美術很重要、設計訪談、Alexa的功能也很重要，如果沒有這些功能，我們就沒有完成這樣的一個專案。當然最重要的是拍片要拍得好看，還有要能夠翻譯英文給外國人看，這些都很重要，所以有人說團隊的威力很強大我也是深有同感。另外是點子的發想，以為就只是發想點子，本來覺得自己在團隊裡面不知道能夠參與什麼任務，沒想到自己可以在API找到自己的才華可以貢獻的地方，如果當初想太多覺得事情很難自己不知道能夠發揮什麼就不去做的話也會不知道自己原來有這種潛能。學習心得有三點：1.點子發想到實踐的過程 。2.與其它夥伴串接API和難搞的GOOGLE API 。3.當一個工程師好聽好辛苦，還是當按摩師好累好好睡。 經過了這一次Alexa的體驗之後，建議Amazon一定要重視亞洲的市場定位，他的確很好用而且很適合我們按摩的工作，但他現在只會講英文，如果他能夠講中文一定非常的有賣相。Rachael我學習到是人讓project 有生命，中間的歷程有曲折有辛苦 即便如此還是ㄧ起走到結束，這個project就有了意義，謝謝大家辛苦了。Emily從使用者的角度理解需求，到實作出產品！技術上的串連也好複雜，一個技術必須與好多人溝通協調，謝謝大家！我看到很多潛力，尤其在weiyi與young身上，希望未來你們都別小看自己！我們的黑客松主題做跟視障按摩排程服務的題目。這是台灣（或亞洲）特有的行業，平均一個按摩師一天最多服務6位客人，收入不定，但高的時候有台幣$3000以上。全台有38%的視障者有工作，大多兼職，其中1/4是從事按摩。既然Alexa是聲控的智慧家庭系統，我們來實驗怎麼用科技顛覆最需要用聲音跟世界溝通的一群人的生涯。Emily Chang 跟 Rachael Pai 得過鴻海舉辦的黑客松冠軍，（Young)Jun Yang Feng是全台第一個完成Hour of Code的視障者，隨後我們有YuRong, Wei-Yi 及Rory的加入，讓使用者體驗設計與前端的流程更融入並更順暢。 ', 'Hope we get to have ""mandarin"" version out soon so we could serve the local massage specialists better.

"Cryptocause","Work together with others to mine bitcoin in browser and donate to charities. Cryptocurrency used for a good cause.","[4308, ""Ethan and I happened upon this idea independently through completely different means. Coming to Hack the North, I had just uninstalled a sketchy bitcoin mining virus on my computer, and I was contemplating making my own bot-net. Ethan was inspired by Stanford's Folding@Home project, which sparked ideas in him about crowdsourced computing for a good cause. When we came together as a team, we knew we wanted to apply Bitcoin technology, and this idea for a distributed computing project for charitable causes came about. "", ""Cryptocause uses WebWorkers to mine bitcoins inside of the browser without any miner install. This allows for both a more accessible way for individuals and charities to experiment with Bitcoin, but also for a larger potential pool of users contributing to the mining effort. These funds are funneled and held in Cryptocause's wallet through Coinbase, which we monitor with a Node backend to distribute a threshold of Bitcoin using Coinbase's API's to a charity selected from a database of charities with known Bitcoin addresses. Because Coinbase allows for users to receive Bitcoin without having created an address on the Bitcoin network, charities can also receive the funds by email notification, through which they can get paid directly to their bank account. "", ""The mining script uses HTTP long-polling and RPC on the server to connect to a decentralized, peer-to-peer mining pool that pays out to our Coinbase address. The script itself takes advantage of WebWorkers and multithreading to maximize the computing power we can derive from the browser. We then provided real-time analytics with Epoch, D3.js, and WebSockets connected to our Node backend to give neat insights into the hash rates of the client, the total clients connected, and the pool itself over time. Our stack is hosted on Linode, which also runs bitcoind and P2Pool to manage payouts and statistics. The Node itself is currently using Coinbase's sandbox development environment, but could easily be changed to production should our project attract enough visitors to generate a significant amount of Bitcoin.Challenges we facedOne of our primary challenges was forking Hamiyoca, which provided a starting place for being able to mine Bitcoin from the browser. Being an unmaintained repository, we had to go through the repo and fix bugs in the backend that were related to now-deprecated browser technologies (we plan on submitting a good amount of pull requests in the near future). Another challenge we faced was finding an initial mining pool that supported an older mining protocol called getblocktemplate, as we did not have the time to implement Stratum-based browser mining during the 36 hours.What's next for CryptocauseFor the future, we're planning on maximizing the efficiency of a browser-based Bitcoin miner with Chrome's Native Client in order to be able to tap into lower-level technologies like GPU shaders.

"3Degrees","iOS/Android app for burn diagnostics &amp; novel injury progression analytics using FLIR imaging","[6279, ""Burns are bad. Lots of people suffer terribly from them, and we, as a medical community - don't know that much about them. Our project seeks to address two major issues in the field of burn injuries:1) Diagnosis through Quantitative MetricsStatus quo diagnosis of burn wounds is left to the eye of the burn surgeon/dermatologist, as per the following 4 characteristics; Depth, Cause, Appearance, and Level of Pain. (Diagnostic Parameters) Of these metrics, the distinction of depth is often unclear externally, the latter two are arguably immeasurable objectively, and the last often has no standard of comparison (which complicates the entire diagnostic system). This uncertainty manifests itself in the relatively high variance of burn diagnoses for identical images in double blind studies, even amongst leading dermatologists in the field.By measuring burn depth by proxy with a newly substantiated biometric (heat, as a function of collagen denaturation), one can objectively determine the damage and full topography of the wound. 2D thermal images can be processed, and using the linear nature of heat conduction, can use 3D temperature levels to indirectly derive wound topography. Much like an iceberg, a burn only demonstrates a small amount of the wound externally, where there is extensive tissue death beneath the surface both immediately, and uniquely - experiences continued apoptosis after removal of heat stimulus. 2) Noninvasive Injury Progression TrackingCurrent widespread method of depth and wound analysis is done through invasive biopsies. Not only do these inherently disrupt the wound healing process, but they only give one unique data point per biopsy. Due to the organic/nebulous shapes of burn wounds, however, these 'guessing points' from biopsies do not nearly paint an accurate picture of the state of the entire burn. In fact, depending on where they are taken, they can improperly generalize the state of the entire wound and lead to incorrect, or at best, quasi-arbitrary dosage information.  "", 'Takes a 2D IR image as an input, creates a dynamic 3D model, computes pertinent wound properties, diagnoses burn degree, calculates post-trauma fluid requirement. ', 'Python serves as a middleman by taking a 2D orthogonal thermal image from our iOS/Android frontend input to our Mathematica script on the backend, called via the Wolfram Cloud Platform RESTful API. Image is decomposed pixel by pixel, assigning a given Z (depth) value to each coordinate in the XY plane based on the RGB color value from the original image. Points are then restructured and plotted using Wolfram 3DMap and Plot functions, smoothed to a surface of Isotherms, exported, and handed off to our front end again using Python for dynamic 3D Visualization. Further analytics are processed using Wolfram to attain values for burn degree, various other burn characteristics (surface area, volume), and estimated recovery time (note: varies significantly per person, so it\'s fairly inaccurate, but we wanted to implement the capability as the body of research attains a more accurate rate function).Minimum fluid requirement in 24 hours post-trauma (as per the Parkland Equation), is calculated, an essential treatment parameter for burn victims. ""Burned Body Area %"" is a fairly difficult value to attain for most people, so we offer a much more intuitive system that includes either estimating the wound size relative to the effected limb(s) (see: [Wallace Rule of Nines])(http://www.remm.nlm.gov/burns.htm), or even easier, a \'Draw\' option onto a vectorized body, which then automatically computes the % wound coverage by comparing altered pixels to original pixels.

Our dealer, Brian, turns over one card, ranging from Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. up to Jack, Queen and finally King. You start playing by guessing whether the next card turned over will be higher or lower than the current one.  To do this, you simply say Higher or Lower when Brian asks for your guess.If you are correct, you gain a point and you can keep playing.   You continue guessing Higher or Lower until you guess incorrectly, decide to stop (by saying Stop), or save your score if it\'s a good one.SCORINGThe game can record your Best Score, but only if you tell it to (say ""Save my Score"").

"Online Planning System ","Synchronize your external planning tool to Office 365 which gives your users an overview and Office integration.","[4840, ""Many consultancy firms use an external system to maintain the planning of their employees. In most of these planning tools the user's personal Outlook calendar is not integrated. This means that employees need to maintain their own planning in sync. The idea of this application was to make things simpler for our employees by creating an Office 365 application which keeps their calendar in sync with the external planning tool. In the application itself, they can see their own planning and that of a colleague, and they have the ability to synchronize their calendar manually or automatically. How it worksWe first started with an application that extracted all the clients and events from an external planning tool via an XML data connection. Soon we noticed the potential of the application, so we turned this into an automatic process that synchronizes the events with our SQL database that is accessible via a Web API on Azure.Users that login into the application have the ability to view their own planning and that of a colleague. We incorporated a functionality that gives a visual hint when consultants are allocated for the same client. This could make it easier to plan things like carpooling and meetings.Of course we know that an extra tool in the company would be something that eventually will stay unused. So we added the ability for the user to automatically synchronize their planning automatically and to receive mail notifications when their are updates made to their planning. This could be useful when you were not aware of new clients or planning updates.All these functions are also available from within Outlook via add-in integration. The Outlook Add-in enables the users to send an overview to their clients when the consultants will be present.Another advantage is: the manager or planning operator does not have to send exported Excel files to their clients. They can just add the overview of the planned days into the mail via the add-in.How we built itWe have built it with various technologies. First we started with a simple MVC application to visualize the user's planning from the external planning tool. Quickly we noticed the potential and also the problem that could occur when a lot of users will make use of this tool; the connection would be limited. So we went for another approach and we developed a Web API on Azure with a SQL database. A scheduled web job on Azure: it runs every hour and synchronizes all the data from the external planning system into our SQL database via REST end-point (Azure Web API).After the web job is done synchronizing, which typically takes about 1-2 minutes (depending on the number of people and changes), it synchronizes the planning of each individual to their Office 365 calendar; only if auto-synchronization is turned on. For adding and updating events in the Office 365 calendars, we have used the Microsoft Graph API. As we do not want to update the planning of the user each time the job runs, we added an identifier which enables us to check if it is an event created from the planning application. This enables the application to update or remove events.The interface of the application and add-in have been built by making use of the Office UI Fabric. Here is a diagram of the components:Challenges we ran intoMicrosoft Graph API and the time zone gave us a little headache. The API has changed many times before it went GA and there were a couple of drastic changes to the date format of adding or updating events.Accomplishments that we are proud ofThese external planning tools are difficult to work with if you do not know everything about them.

"EverGreen","A developer tool to analyze and reduce the carbon emissions of code","[3159, 'One of the most pressing societal issues right now is the environment impact of CO2 emissions. Companies and organizations around the world have made huge efforts in an attempt to avoid environmental disaster. The field of Computer Science often overlooks these issues because from the outside, it seems programming would not have a negative impact on our planet’s health.  However, it is important that we be aware of the part we play and know how we can help by improving the way we code.What it DoesEverGreen is an eco-aware IDE. Given an expected amount of traffic and set of computer specs, EverGreen is able to capture the environmental impact that a programmer\'s code will have by using various metrics such as the carbon emitted in the average lifespan of a car. Since many of today\'s large computations are done on the cloud, we have provided users with various industry standard AWS instance type based architectures.How We Built itCALCULATING APPROXIMATE CO2 EMISSIONSAfter reading through several papers and articles we formulated a means of calculating the CO2 emissions. Following the results of this paper, we used the following equations to calculate the CO2 emissions for a given piece of code:https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02243We then needed to generalize the emissions for other hardware. This was done by using profiling and static analysis to extrapolate and approximate the CO2 emissions for other architectures.SUGGESTING CODE IMPROVEMENTSWe used a Context-Free Grammar to map various commonly written code with lines that produce less CO2 emissions. Additionally, we made it such that we can easily create more rules in the future.Challenges We Ran IntoOne of the most difficult aspects of the project was to suggest improvements for inefficient code. Initially, we attempted a ""find and replace"" solution, but we quickly saw flaws in attempting to make our code flexible. Our solution was to use grammars in order to figure out a seemless way to create additional performance suggestions.Accomplishments That We\'re Proud OfA primary goal of ours was to evoke emotion about environmental impact, and we are really proud of the graphics we created to do so.

"E.A.T. UX Challenge","To create a humanizing experience that empowers families to successfully apply for free or discounted school meals.","[5377, ""Inspired by the opportunity for broad social impact, a Chaotic Moon design team carved out some spare time and answered the call -- interviewing, prototyping, testing, writing, illustrating, iterating, and coding their way to a simple, intuitive, forward-thinking online application template.    Our Design ProcessPrior to starting this project, we defined three principles to help guide our design process: Empowerment, Humanization, and Relevance. Empowerment: Provide parents with the ability to complete the application with confidence.Humanization: Design an experience that respects a parent’s situation using language that is empathetic and easy to understand.Relevance: Provide parents with appropriate and relevant instruction to increase understanding and accuracy.We experimented with an aggressive, iterative approach: 1.5 weeks of concepting and 1.5 weeks to test and refine the application. We began by conducting high-level research to define the project, followed by in-depth discussions with school administrators, volunteers, and parents during our design phase. While we would have preferred to do the bulk of the research up front, time constraints and busy schedules made it impossible to do so. Therefore, we had to make a lot of assumptions before strengthening our concept with research findings in the second iteration. In regards to visual design, we created mood boards to establish the tone and mood of the interface during the beginning of the project. After we solidified our final concept, our visual designers quickly began work on a design language and illustrations. We focused on creating a design that was friendly and approachable for the user.ChallengesHaving 12 team members on any project requires coordination, especially when 7 of those members are UX designers! Going into the project, we did not establish a hierarchy for roles or assign one person to oversee the direction of the design. However, due to our commitment and passion, we collaborated very well and natural roles emerged. In the end, every single team member can claim ownership of at least one deliverable.This project would have been much easier if the goal was to simply create a digital version of the existing paper application. However, in tackling this project, we wanted to create a better, more human experience for individuals filling out the application. This required a much more in-depth understanding of where people are struggling with the application and more importantly, why. Understanding the why allowed us to make design decisions that are geared towards addressing the root cause of the issue.

We hope our application will have a positive impact.49 million Americans are living in food insecurity while 70 billion pounds of food goes to waste annually in the United States. GrubShare is an all-in-one platform for connecting food banks to restaurants and grocers with excess food. Donors simply indicate the quantity and value of their excess food and volunteers and employees of food banks are notified. Then, site provides a fastest-calculated route to pick up a series of donations in a timely fashion. The program automatically tracks donations and provides up-to-date tax-deductible savings for businesses who are able to save 25% on otherwise sunk costs—while simultaneously feeding hungry people. Food banks reduce costs, increase their ability to server a larger market, and require less staff to coordinate an otherwise labor intensive process.Donors save thousands of dollars. Food banks increase impact. And GrubShare solves food insecurity, one meal at a time.Advantages- Our advantage is simple: no other platform is more user friendly, takes less than 20 seconds to make a donation, or integrates the power of ArcGIS map technology to make the fastest, most efficient routes possible.The Technical Side-There are two primary users for GrubShare: Food Banks and Food Providers (i.e. restaurants, grocers, and stores with excess food that would otherwise be discarded). New users register accounts and then have access to a series of primary functions:Food Providers: On any given day, if a Food Provider has excess food, they may submit a form to indicate the quantity and value of their intended donation. They will receive an automatic notification of when the food will be picked up. Food Providers’ accounts will also have a running total of meals provided and dollars saved via tax deductible donations. In order to encourage frequent donations, the home page of the site will eventually provide statistics on top-donors.Food Banks: Having selected a specific service region, Food Banks receive donation notifications from Food Providers in that area. Registered Food Banks may log in to their account to see a series of pins on a map of their region to see the donations of that day. Based on potentially limited resources, Food Banks select the donation sites they will be able to visit. Then, using ArcGIS map technology, they receive the fastest-possible route between locations, automatically notifying Food Providers of their estimated arrival times. Additionally, there are plans to implement a ranking system to note the quality and reliability of donations from Food Providers. Food Banks may choose to decline offers from Food Suppliers who frequently have expired or inedible donations.GrubShare seeks to tackle one of the most prominent social problems of the 21st century by providing cutting edge technology to the non-profit sector.

"Ges::ndheit.space","Compress all available Health and Fitness Data into one simple instruction on how to improve your health.","[4799, 'There are gazillions of different devices and services to track your health and fitness data. Additionally, there are dozens of services to display your raw health data using fancy graphics and sophisticated animations. But why don’t you use them?In a classical Finnish sauna business meeting, we figured out that the way to help you with your health is not to show you even more diagrams, bar charts and tables but to keep it simple (, stupid). That is why we came up with Ges::ndheit.Well, let us introduce Ges::ndheit: ', 'Ges::ndheit is the solution for all of your health problems. It’s the swiss army knife of the personal assistant apps. It is the last ray of sun before the cold night (which is like 4pm in Finland).Ges::ndheit solves the information overload of all those smart devices you own by reducing all of the available data into one clear personalized instruction on how you can improve your health. Those instructions vary from simple text-based recommendations up to adjustments of your SmartHome devices. The personalized instructions are constructed by a recommendation algorithm that combines your health and context data with research, cohort and health consultant data. The impact of the recommendation algorithm can be leveraged further by any data about you and your environment.  ', ""As a team of five developers we split work into three main areas: Backend, iOS App & Design.BackendOur backend team was mainly focused on getting as much information as possible from various data sources (OURA, Isaacus, Kanta, Localtapiola, Tieto & ISS, Apple HealthKit and many more). This information was highly heterogenous, thus we had to clean, restructure and combine it before we could use it in our classification algorithm.This algorithm had to be developed as well. It is responsible for detecting the benchmarks for a good health that we could compare the user's data to. The algorithm uses clustering to detect cohorts of similar people.To get access to those values, a REST-API was created as well.AppFollowing our idea of simplifying the large amounts of daily health data, our app reduces distraction by using a simplistic design. It lets you concentrate on living a healthy life. All you have to do to live a healthier life is to allow Ges::ndheit access to HealthKit and (optionally) Kanta. The app then automatically fetches your data and compares it with other patients’ data in our backend to generate a personalized instruction just for you.Performance-wise the whole app is 100% pure Swift in order to run as fast as possible. "", 'There were a lot of technical difficulties in making the data look pretty, so it is comparable and clusterable. Mistakes in some datasets (e.g. 500kg+ body weight) made it even more difficult for us, as we had to clean the data using outlier detection.Another challenge was that some of the IOT devices we wanted to use were either not provided (e.g. the Nest thermostat) or already taken (e.g. the Amazon Echo). The former could be solved by creating a Nest Thermostat Simulator which is now accessed by our API instead of the real technical device. ', 'Our team worked very well, as everybody had distinct expertises that combined covered the whole range from Design, over Frontend, Apps, and Backend to Machine Learning.As mentioned above, the backend team worked hard on the implementation of an algorithm to find groups of user types and to match you in one of those to find reference values. We think that we came up with a very good solution considering the time we could spent on it.Finally, we believe that Ges::ndheit can have a huge impact on overall global health and could make the world a better place by producing healthier residents. ', 'If you go to Finland take enough money with you, as beer is really expensive there. ', 'Ges::ndheit made us realize that there is a lot of .space for improvements in current HealthTech applications and services.

"Ethos","Chrome extension that reports bias in articles via NLP and generates author profiles through IBM Alchemy Watson API.","[5105, 'November 9th was an eventful day for all, and likely a day that will go down in history. Regardless of which side one is on, there are many lessons that must be learned. We saw the power of the media firsthand, as journalists published article after article in a deluge of political news, rhetoric and prediction, a chaotic echo chamber that did no one any good. We want to raise the standard of journalistic integrity, and remind everyone of how easily we can be biased and swayed. That inspired us to build Ethos, an automated tool that analyses the words we consume. It’s easy for humans to be unobjective, and so we hope that the unbiased rationality of computers can be brought in to counter our inherently tinted lenses. ', 'Ethos is a Chrome extension created to analyze articles for their level of objectivity or bias using natural language processing elements from the IBM Watson API. Additionally, data is searched and compiled from previous articles written by the same author in order to deliver a general report on the author’s bias, openness to different perspectives, and topics of focus. User-interactivity was incorporated through a Facebook scraper that analyzes articles at real-time while scrolling through a news feed. ', 'There are two main parts to the project, the client-side Chrome extension, and the Flask API server it contacts. The Chrome extension was written largely in HTML/CSS/JS, doing client-side retrieval of document analysis via the IBM AlchemyLanugage API for low-latency display of data e.g. in the facebook feed. For more involved data processing, the Chrome Extension made AJAX requests to a Flask server hosted on Heroku. The Flask server was responsible for processing authors, aggregating their works, doing personality analysis and incorporating feedback. Authors were extracted via the AlchemyLanguage API and we used the AlchemyDataNews API to search for their past writing, before judging their overall objectivity. To avoid excessive API calls, authors and articles were cached on server in a Postgres database. We used the IBM Watson Personality Insights API to evaluate author personalities for added insight, while accumulating the various taxonomies of an author’s body of work to assess how knowledgeable and familiar they were with a specific area. We also used the Diffbot API to detect if a page contained an article. ', 'The main challenge during this project was manipulating the raw data from the Watson API and displaying it in a user-friendly form. We spent a considerable amount of time trying to represent the intangibility of bias and objectivity in a succinct but also intuitive way, finally settling on a series of elegant bars. Another problem was the detection of articles and the absence of author data, which we detected by running test cases and solved by dispatch bulletproofing. ', 'We’re proud of the fact that we were able to pool together our respective skills and develop a product that could potentially bring around change regarding an issue that we all felt strongly about. From dealing with minor issues by consulting each other and friends, waiting through long lines to grab food and snacks, to overcoming huge project workflow hurdles by chalkboarding out large diagrams, we’re proud to say that the project—and us—all came together at the end. ', 'We all developed both technical and non-technical skills during the process of this hackathon. In terms of technical skills, we all definitely learned more about website development, specifically JQuery, Flask, and SQL. In terms of soft skills, we learned to collaborate with each other and work with each other’s strengths and weaknesses in order to create with a coherent final product. ', 'We would like to integrate with more social media sites like Twitter and Reddit. Also, we could work on improving the accuracy of article detection and streamline the bulletproofing for cases where Watson has a difficult time analyzing the data. We also want to find ways to compile information from a larger data set without putting such a heavy stress on the Watson Alchemy system.

"CodeClimbers","Tired of grinding Leetcode alone? Make interview prep more fun with CodeClimbers, a social &amp; educational coding game!","[6570, ""The Origin Story: We had all been anticipating HackUCI and wondering what we were going to make. Then one night at Albert's house, the inspiration came. We were all practicing LeetCode questions together by mock interviewing each other and discussion solutions. Albert had half of a solution to a LeetCode question left on a whiteboard, and I jokingly told Jeff to hurry and try to finish Albert's code before he came back. Leon immediately thought it was a great idea for us to try and implement it for HackUCI. And then the dream was born...The inspiration for the application itself comes from the educational value of LeetCode, and the ease of collaborating with friends through applications like Google Docs. There are not enough interactive coding environments available, especially to beginner programmers learning how to code through pair programming. Another issue that comes up with pair programming that we have all experienced is that two different people may not be used to typing with the other person's laptop/computer, so CodeClimbers allows for pair programming with the comfort of your own keyboard. CodeClimbers is a solution that is fun, social, and educational! Why is it called CodeClimbers?: The name CodeClimbers comes from the fact that learning how to code and become a LeetCode pro is a climb. We believe that every time we choose to team up with friends to make studying more fun, we make the climb just a little bit easier! We're all in this together! "", 'CodeClimbers allows a user to team up with a friend to solve common programming questions. Users have the option to create a room or join a room using a code! It allows for two users to be in the same coding room and type in the same editor. The catch is, only one user can type in the editor at a time. This ensures that each user gets a turn at typing and prevents one user from overpowering another user (like what can happen in a normal pair programming situation). The timer is displayed on screen that signals when the switch is about to happen. Also on screen is whose turn it is. During the experience, the users can both run the code and see the output or error messages (using the run button). When they believe that their solution works, they may submit their code (using the submit button), and their code will be sent through a few hidden test cases before sending the users some feedback on how they did!Be sure to check out the demo on Youtube! Demo Here ', 'We built the client side of our project using Vue.js and Firebase. Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications and Firebase is a web-application (and mobile-application) development platform that we used to store our data in a real-time environment. The real-time database was key to allowing multiple users type in the editor at the same time. Vue.js was used to write all of the different components of the page- the editor, timer, header, question-box, etc. We built the server side of our project using Express.js, Node.js, and judge0. Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs. We used Express to be able to make requests to the API judge0, to compile Python code we posted and get back submission details.  ', 'We ran into a few challenges through the course of HackUCI. These involved, issues with handling asynchronous requests with the server and learning how to work with Firebase (connecting and working with a Real-Time Database!). In the beginning, these issues were a bit discouraging, but we powered through and were able to get it together! Two members of the team had little to no experience with Javascript at the beginning of Hack, so we had to learn fast.  ', ""We are all very proud of the product we were able to push out during HackUCI. This is the first big project that we have worked on as a team. We're proud that we were able to stay motivated and push through. Before we started the project, we weren't sure how we were going to do it because we had never worked with many of the technologies. However, that didn't stop us from successfully implementing a lot of our project's core functionalities.  "", 'We learned how to use Firebase and work with a Real-Time Database, some of us learned Javascript for the first time, most of us learned Vue.js for the first time as well. We learned how to deal with asynchronous requests, communicate with a database, and connect a working client to a working server! This project was more complicated than any project that we have ever had to do for school, so we had to learn how to manage our time effectively and self-teach on a lot of topics! Most importantly, we learned that we all work really well as a team!  ', ""There is always room to grow! CodeClimbers hopes to eventually expand our program to allow for more coding languages. We also wish to implement a leaderboard so teams can see how they did compared to other. The design of the web application can always be improved as well to be more user friendly and intuitive. We are always striving to be better. Another feature that we hope to add in the future is a chat box so users don't need to be side by side to communicate while coding! We are hoping to deploy our project soon so everyone can have easy access to it!Thank you for taking the time to view our project!

"CropNext: Real Time Monitoring Of Crop Health","Helping farmers grow more!","[5012, ""Millions of farmers in the world each year face loss of their crop. Its mainly due to crop disease or environmental problems like nature of soil (pH), poor quality of air, and excessive or very low moisture in soil.To get cure from these problems, farmers need to know the fertilizer according to the condition of the soil and also the amount of water needed everyday for his crop with respect to the temperature, moisture and humidity.More than a million people's occupation in the US is farming and we need a innovative solution, which is affordable and can be implemented in the current scenario.What will be end final product?The idea is to make a hardware + mobile app which could be used by farmers, can update farmers with any issues with their farms and can analyse amount of sunlight, rain, soil moisture, pH and can suggest best fertilizers according to the data from the sensors and USDA datasets. It can also compare the data with the local weather data for that GPS location. The app will also have real-time updated selling prices of crops for the farmer. "", 'CropNext is a new revolutionary device which helps growers know about their crops. CropNext gives real times updates about what is happening inside your farm. Weather it is low soil moisture, polluted air and infectious gases, acid rain, crop disease, locust invasion, or crows on your crops, it keeps you informed about everythingThe CropNext Farm Sensor tracks light, humidity, temperature, soil pH and moisture, and then cross-references this information with plant, soil science, and weather databases to recommend which plants will thrive.This is the device with the mobile app. ', 'First of all, I thought what are the challenges faced by farmers in the US and the world.

I look to many kinds of hardware and found one ans then I build the project on Linkit One development board.All the data is stored in Windows Azure cloud and Ubidots API.How does it work?The device records data using local sensors and then pushes that data into the cloud. Then the data is compared with the USDA datasets and if the server identifies any issue like low soil moisture, low sunlight, low fertilizer etc, it informs the farmer and suggests him some fertilizers. Also the data can be viewed using a web dashboard and a mobile application.Here you can see how this system actually works. All the data is sent to cloud, then compared with USDA datasets and then notify farmers with any issues.This is the web platform of the device. This will show all real time data.

Next step was to improve the accuracy, then I worked on that part. Next I worked on lowering the cost of the device, for this challenge, I talked to some mentors and chose the right hardware for my prototype.This was the hardware!I fixed the hardware into a soda bottle. This was realy easy by cutting it down and pushing the PCB board into it. The bottle shape of the device was liked by the mentors.Finally I consulted some mentors for the project and I was very lucky to test the device at Tech Mahindra campus.  ', ""What change will CropNext make? Let's see current solutions.These are the current solution available. These are big electrodes, heavy machines etc and the main problem is that they can only be used by technical experts and not farmers! The projects aim is to make this system automatic.This is the comparison of my solution to current solutions. I'm proud to make something that can bring a change to the world.

"HEAR","Generating Subtitles for Life","[3247, 'Inspired by a recent conference talk on accessibility as well as family members that are hearing impaired, we wanted to create a hack that targeted pain points that individuals with hard of hearing deal with, every day.TechnologiesARKit 2The ARKit 2 was used to capture objects in a 3D scene and attach subtitle nodes to them allowing the subtitles to follow speakers. Subtitle text size is dictated based off distance which would not be possible without ARKit.CoreML 2CoreML2 was mostly used for its computer vision application. HEAR uses facial recognition to detect potential speakers and to position subtitles in the right position. This is achieved efficiently by utilizing the Vision API.SiriKitSpeech to text is the most important feature of HEAR and for that reason, the SiriKit was chosen to transcribe speech from speakers to subtitles. Having Siri perform some computations and natural language processing locally helps speedup the transcription which leads to a better user experience.SpriteKitHEAR uses SpriteKit to overlay the subtitles in a 3D environment. SpriteKit also allows text customization to make the text clearer and more legible on varying backgrounds.ChallengesAs none of the members were familiar with Swift or iOS development, creating the HEAR iOS application and utilizing advanced technologies was both challenging and exciting. While the learning curve was steep, working together through paired programming helped us work through problems efficiently as well as ease the transition of learning a completely new environment.Technically, we ran into trouble using SpriteKit and ARKit, as most tutorials and documentation required the user to touch where they wanted to place an object. We wanted our object placed based off of the decision made from the facial recognition software we created. Calculating the true depth and changing the subtitle attributes accordingly required more math than we were ready for.

"Twine Health Activation Platform","Empowers patients to achieve maximum self-efficacy in their health through continuous collaboration with care teams.","[7914, 'I left practicing medicine 10 years ago because of significant disappointment in the ability of the healthcare system to support patients between visits and to embrace their contribution as part of the team. I was inspired to push the limits of patient participation and to build technology to facilitate dramatically better care. ', ""Health Activation is the process of empowering patients to break free from the typical reactive healthcare experience and to become proactive in taking control of their health.The Twine Health Activation Platform is a cloud-based SaaS offering that runs as an app (iOS and Android) and in the browser (Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) for patients and their care team members. It synchronizes with Apple HealthKit and Google FIt, and therefore leverages a wide variety of connected devices (glucometers, blood pressure cuffs, pedometers, etc.) and apps (MyFitnessPal, LoseIt, etc.)Twine empowers patients to co-create action plans and goals with members of their care team through shared decision making. These action plans are automatically synchronized to the patient's devices (phones, tablets, computers, etc.) and provide timely reminders and learning opportunities through the course of the day to help support the patient in successfully achieving goals. Streamlined communication tools including secure text (with attachments, photos, videos, etc.) and video calls allow patients to get support from the care team right at the moments that they need it. Powerful analytics including artificial intelligence on the care team dashboard allow the quick identification of patients in need so that the right care can be delivered to the right person at the right time. A powerful new class of cohort-based intervention analytics leveraging daily patient self-report data give the care team real-time insight into effectiveness of each care team member and into interventions at large. "", 'Our core team spend 6 years at the MIT Media Lab researching health activation and building a predecessor platform called CollaboRhythm. We built what was likely the first healthcare app on a smartphone in 2006 and have continued to push the limits of patient participation since then. We used this experience to begin building Twine in 2014. We have worked with thousands of patients and over 70 healthcare organizations/practices in refining its functionality and impact on the experience, outcomes, and cost of care.The Twine platform consists of two major components. A client application (the TwineClient) that is implemented as an HTML5 single-page application using the AngularJS framework. The TwineClient is available as both a web application and well as a native mobile application (packaged with the Cordova framework) for iOS and Android. A server application exposing a RESTFul API (the TwineServer) is implemented with NodeJS leveraging MongoDB as the database. The TwineClient and TwineServer are both hosted on Amazon Web Services.Accomplishments that we are proud ofOur team has published the largest impact hypertension (26mmHg drop in blood pressure in 3 months) and diabetes (3.2 drop in HbA1c in 3 months) in the world by a significant margin. This work was done with the Massachusetts General Hospital (https://www.twinehealth.com/hypertension-rct) and the Joslin Diabetes Center (https://www.twinehealth.com/diabetes-study), respectively, and also demonstrated significant cost reductions and improvements in patient satisfaction.We have reproduced these results consistently with other organizations, and we expect to report on similar outcomes in hypercholesterolemia, COPD, asthma, CHF, etc. as we have partners leveraging Twine across dozens of different condition / wellness interventions.We have demonstrated that Twine can produce a 3x increase in health coach (a particular type of care team member) panel size and a 66% reduction in all cause office visits in parallel with the outcome improvements listed above. This degree of scalability has the opportunity to profoundly affect healthcare costs. ', ""The biggest challenge for Twine has been that the majority of healthcare is paid for under fee-for-service mechanisms and thrives when outcomes are poor and costs are high. Most Accountable Care Organizations do not have nearly enough risk in their portfolio of payment contracts to justify improvements in primary care - only in 90 day hospital readmissions, certain bundled payments, and other glancing blows at healthcare outcome deficiencies and cost problems. We know this because we succeeded in dramatically improving hypertension and diabetes outcomes with several ACOs only to be told that they did not want to the interventions because the outcomes decreased revenue (fewer office visits, fewer referrals, fewer ER visits, fewer hospitalizations, etc.).What we learnedWe have learned a great deal over the past 10 years about the learning science and health psychology of patient behavior change and how to build technology that maximizes collaboration between patients and care teams.We have also learned that the market of workplace health is an incredibly exciting space for innovation in primary care. Self-insured employers have a tremendous desire to improve the experience of healthcare and to decrease costs because they are directly responsible for the healthcare bill for their employers. Many are contracting with providers directly to build primary care practices on premise and are experiencing 20-40% decreases in total cost of care with the dramatically improved care that can be delivered outside of fee-for-service medicine. Others are contracting with near-site practices or adopting biometric screening and health coaching programs.Even health systems are deploying new models of care for their own employees as an opportunity to learn to deliver value-based primary care. They want to lower their own healthcare cost and improve employee health, but they also want to build competencies for when their mainstream value-based care contracts cross the risk threshold that they will need to leverage the same models for all of the lives covered.Twine now works with a variety of workplace health vendors and employee health programs at health systems and our business is focused on expanding in this market.What's next for Twine Health Activation PlatformOur team is currently working on a number of exciting enhancements to the platform that we believe are going to dramatically enhance the experience for patients and the scalability of care teams. In the coming weeks, we will release a patient self-directed experience in Twine that allows people to get started setting and achieving goals even before a health coach or care team is available. Then we will augment this experience with the ability for patients to add family members, friends, and peers and to work with multiple care teams simultaneously. The vision is for Twine to become the center of all healthcare experiences for a patient.Alignment with the GE Health CloudTwine will be pursuing HITRUST certification this year and is looking for partnership opportunities to expand our reach in the healthcare market.

"DZ - Context News Bot","Solving the misinformation problem in the information age with Machine Learning","[4141, ""Social media algorithms are built for engagement & likes, not perspective, and we aim to fix that with Context News Bot.We’ve all been in never-ending arguments with friends and family on critical issues like politics, international events or religion in the past. In recent years, however, we see a trend in people blindly trusting ‘facts’ they learnt from a video they saw last morning on WhatsApp or tweets by an influential person. This epidemic is especially prominent in people who grew up before the information age of computers and have never had to question the credibility of news sources in the past.The ProblemThe inability of people to create an internal filter against their own bias has caused the proliferation of false (or somewhat false) information to plague modern society and is slowly leading us to a world with only polarizing opinions. Today's modern discovery algorithms trap us in our ‘filter bubbles' by giving us content that agrees with our inherent biases regardless of whether these biases are grounded in reality. "", 'We built a Machine Learning based web API that allows users to fact-check any content on social media and gain a broader perspective on news items and events. The service helps get rid of inherent biases by understanding the semantics of content and suggesting related news articles and Wikipedia entries that aim to give an objective and global perspective. Our Natural Language Processing pipeline performs entity and topic extraction from tweets to search for news articles from reliable sources and discover Wikipedia articles. We combine this information with sentiment analysis signals for the tweet as well as the news articles to select articles which have a different perspective from the tweet.Our service was seamlessly integrated into Twitter’s user interface to build an intuitive proof of concept. ', ""The tech stack consists of a Chrome extension (to scrape the tweet and add the context panel), a Flask server that communicates with the Twitter API, a news search API & a custom Natural Language Processing pipeline built on top of the Google Cloud API. We calculate the final ‘scores’ for the news articles based on our own heuristic-based feature engineering combined with deep neural networks from Google’s API.User ExperienceWe embedded our service into the Twitter UI as a button which was designed to blend into Twitter’s UI and be intuitive to use for a regular user. Upon clicking the CNB button, beautiful and informative news cards will drop down under the selected tweet, showing relevant news articles and Wikipedia entries, along with a polarity meter to show agreement/disagreement with the tweet.

"myNursebot","Track your symptoms, medications, readings and appointments just using your voice.","[6888, ""myNursebot was born out of need to take care of my mom who despises tracking medications or readings on any screen be it a smartphone or a tablet. She is 76 years old and has high blood pressure for quite some time. Last year, she was rushed to hospital in an emergency because of very high blood pressure. The cause was non compliance with medication as well as not having the ability to log symptoms on a regular basis. Had she taken medications regularly, the emergency visit could have been prevented. Also she did not know that her medications had side effects like nausea, leg pain or state of confusion. Had she known this, she could have consulted the doctor earlier to get different medications that do not have these side effects. Wouldn't it be nice, if there was a way to log the health data at the whim of a verbal command? It is much easier than picking up the device, opening the app or just write it down with old school paper and pen. Our quest began in mid 2016. We searched for easier solutions. We could not find any voice enabled app that could do the job so we thought we will build one. My wife and I tested the feel of Amazon Alexa with our parents. They liked it. We surveyed a group of friends, who had similar issues of logging symptoms and medications.  Having a strong background in software and passion for solving real world problems specifically in the area of health, we decided to build a voice skill. "", 'myNursebot logs health data through voice and generates a health summary.It captures body vitals, symptoms, medications and appointments just by user’s voice. No screen is required. myNursebot also emails health summary whenever the user asks it. The user can choose to share the summary with doctor at next visit for a better treatment plan or can share it with loved ones. By logging the symptoms regularly patients can provide a detailed history to the doctor rather than relying on memory that could be unreliable.  ', 'We started with the product definition. In this phase, we defined what will be the feature set and what is the minimal viable product (MVP) to showcase it to our user community and test the waters. After defining the feature set, we started on two parallel paths - Interaction Model to be developed by Product Management Team and Engineering team to layout the architecture.On the architecture side, we discussed different tool sets and a heated debate on Java vs. PHP continued for couple of weeks. We knew that we need to have a response time of less than 100ms for the voice application to functional normally. Our architecture team finally chose to build the server side in PHP. Because alexa did not support the SDK in php we wrote one.On the product management side, the team wrote the interaction model. They tested different models before finalizing on one as Alexa has its own nuances in which voice interface is implemented.Once an interaction model of a particular product feature was stable, the engineers started implementing it. Testing - We went through normal cycles of testing (feature tests, regression testing, negative testing etc). It took quite some time to foolproof the application specially when users aborted the current context or spoke out of turn. ', 'Interaction Model Challenges - Interaction model defines how voice utterances are to be recognized, interpreted and converted to data (text) that is meaningful to the app. For example, if the user says “Add my blood pressure reading of 120 over 80” will convert to reading_type = “blood pressure”, Systolic BP = 120 and Diastolic BP = 80.Reduce the number of utterances - Alexa only allows 200,000 characters in defining utterances. We worked many iterations to reduce the number of utterances yet keep the quality of the applicationFool proofing the interaction model - With voice interface, user can choose to speak anything they want to. For example, if the app asks, what is your glucose and the user says 1:30PM, the app needs to react in the right way. Either record the glucose as 130 or ask it again. It was quite a challenge for the product management team to foolproof the voice app.Architecture Challenges - We aimed to have an application response time sub 100 ms.Java vs. PHP - Our engineering team debated for more than 3 weeks, built prototypes and finally concluded to go with PHP as it performed better than JavaRules System - myNursebot requires a rules engine that can execute decision trees. It took many weeks to select a rules engine that can deliver responses sub-30ms. The rules execution included querying database in real time. ', 'We are seeing good traction from the user community and the health provider community. Couple of reviews worth mentioning are“Instead of relying on a single read of vital signs in clinic, I have access to a temporal log of vital signs that makes my decisions sound.”“My grandpa measures blood pressure 3 times a day. Mynursebot makes it easier to log the details hands free and create a quick summary to show to the doctor.”We have seen new user signups of more than 75 on a single day and people are buying into the vision of myNursebot. We are proud of the agility of our team team who was able to release the product in less than 5 months from conceptualizing to a stable product.  ', 'Building Voice User Interfaces (VUI) requires a different mindset than building Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). The product design, implementation and testing  is totally different for a VUI based application. Natural Language Processing (NLP) being quite new is going through major development and refinement cycles. This slows application developers like us quite a bit. Alexa and Google Home platforms are quite different when it comes to application definition as their architectures are different. They require VUI tailored to their platform. It is just like developing a native mobile app for iOS, Android and Microsoft platforms and each require a different skill set. ', 'Being in stealth mode, we cannot reveal our upcoming features, however our vision is to provide a health companion with whom patients can talk to and get the necessary actionable information. myNursebot will strengthen the AI algorithms to have a pro-active interaction with the patients and strives to be a market leader in its category.

Also, the knowledge that many school children don't have a parent at home who can assist them with increasing their learning outside the classroom, was a driving factor in creating this bot. Our vision is that the Botvinci bot will become a hub of learning, helping elementary and middle school kids augment their classroom learning in an easy and fun way. Over time, we will add numerous skills to keep the bot interesting, and to leverage NLP, Machine Learning and gamification to improve the efficiency with which subject matter is communicated to students.

This can include our plants, that have need not only for water, but also sunlight (in different intensities). We could create a habit to water the plants at a certain time, but is it really necessary? What if you shouldn't water the plant today, because the soil is already moist or because it will rain within one hour? "", ""CoolPlant uses 4 sensors - soil moisture, air temperature, air humidity and light - to determine plant's current state, check these values against the optimal values for the plant's species, and if some action is necessary, such as the soil is dry so the user needs to water the plant, the app sends an e-mail to the user or users themselves can check the plant's current status on CoolPlant mobile app, that summarizes how the plant is doing.When the app sends notification for the user to take an action, it also checks for precipitation, so users can decide whether water or not their gardens.This app can also be extended to work in groups and cover a bigger area (e.g. a farm or community) making the benefits of saving water much broader. "", 'I used the ESP32 board to connect the sensors, since it supports (partially) Arduino, has built-in wifi, can be powered by battery and is cheap. The device sends data in JSON format to Amazon IOT, that receives it and forwards to Amazon Kinesis. I used Kinesis Firehose delivery streams to buffer this incoming data and save it periodically to an S3 bucket. Every time an S3 object is changed, an S3 event is fired and I could attach a AWS Lambda function to respond to it, sending an e-mail. In other words, every time CoolPlant has a good amount of data to process, a custom Java function is called, reflecting the scenario: ""the plant is communicating and I should check expected/actual data and maybe take an action"".I also created an Android App to allow users to check up-to-date sensor data and weather conditions. For this kind of ""consumer"" (mobile app, web apps, third-parties, etc) I created an API using API Gateway by simply using another Java Lambda function I created with the goal of returning plant\'s current status.The Core of the CoolPlant also uses a Weather API (wunderground) to give additional advice to the user.

"Math Jam","Educational Battle Royale!","[5021, ""Our inspiration to make this web app / game came from the simple dominance of battle royale games. The most popular games played today are of the battle royale genre and we wanted to expand the genre to cover a wider spectrum, such as educational games, to make them more appealing for kids who should not have to be bored or reluctant to learn because of some dull educational tool.The GistIn a nut shell, this application is a multiplayer game that one is able to play with as many people as they wish. The player(s) enter in their desired in game name and are taken to the main game page where their computer screen is filled with a variety of different features and aspects of the game. The game begins when one of the players decides to press the start button of course. The gameplay is parallel across every player in the sense that each player receives random and different sets of questions that are not codependent. The only shared state between the players of the same match / lobby is whether each player is 'alive' or not. The players must answer one of three questions of each question set that include easy, medium, and hard questions. If one gets a question right, they gain points and will see their point / progress bar increase. In addition, as common to all royale games, there is an ever enclosing 'circle' that is represented by another progress bar which increases over time and increases in speed over time as well. The goal of course is to keep one's points above the enclosing zone for as long as possible, or at least for a longer amount of time than the other players so that one is the only player 'alive'. When one's points / progress is lower than the current zone, the player will lose health points until they are 'dead' or until they are once again ahead of the zone. As mentioned before, the game continues until there is one player left. Some extra features include randomized power-ups and question streak bonuses. StackThis game was built using a stack consisting of Javascript, Node.js, Express.js wrapper, and Socket.IO. It is hosted on Heroku. We started with the basic idea of creating the game for a single player scenario where the user should be able to answer the questions infinitely or until they 'die'. This was on a local level as well. We then expanded to adding a seemingly infinite amount of players that can play against each other, however, that was also on a local level. Finally, we expanded to hosting the app on Heroku so players on different devices can play with each other.ChallengesAs with any web socket or Node application, the most prominent issue we ran into was the infamous async issue. We faced a variety of async issues in peculiar locations of our codebase and it was quite difficult to be able to identify these issues accordingly. We first tackled such issues by setting timeouts to block execution of code until some certain segments finished running, however we soon realized that this solution was not scalable and would vary in success on different devices and with different amount of requests. We then decided to utilize more bidirectional socket emit events such that the code segments we want to run after a certain code segment runs would only do so in that manner, emulating a callback function or rather a promise even. Other issues we ran into were mainly syntax issues and what not.AccomplishmentsWe are very proud of our ability to expand our application throughout many stages. We came in thinking we would make a singleplayer game that only ran locally, and overtime as we crossed of checkmarks, we ended up with a full fledged multiplayer game that is hosted online. We are very proud of our overall team cooperation and divvying up of tasks. We were very organized and utilized our time efficiently in terms of code sprints and discussions, etc. What We LearnedWe learned a lot about handling asynchronous issues without using promises and async await functions. We also had team members who were new to coding in general and they learned a lot about front end web development, design, and even an extensive amount of git commands. We also learned a lot more about version control and how rebasing works and also the importance of different branches especially in larger group projects such as these. We also learned about hosting and a lot of similar online services and how they interact with our application.Future PlansWe believe Math Jam has a lot of potential and the next steps would be fine tuning the game in terms of design and functionality and then of course adding more and more features as we see fit. We could even add more dynamic game modes and what not for a more enjoyable experience.Built Withexpress.jsherokujavascriptnode.jssocket.ioTry it outmathjam.herokuapp.com      Submitted to    HackIllinois 2019    Created by  Aviral SaxenaMichael ZhouMichael Kwanpanfj "", ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['javascript', 'node.js', 'express.js', 'socket.io', 'heroku']","False","19","['aviralsaxena', 'aitori', 'michaelkwan', 'panfj']","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/768/973/datas/small.png","False","0"

"Adaptavist ScriptRunner for JIRA Cloud","Extend, automate and enhance your JIRA workflows in JIRA Cloud","[4562, ""ScriptRunner for JIRA is the 3rd on the Atlassian Marketplace list of top selling JIRA add-ons (inside of 1 year). Due to sheer customer demand, Adaptavist wanted to offer the same functionality through JIRA Cloud.ScriptRunner for JIRA Cloud started off as a ShipIt project last year where we achieved a proof of concept. We extended beyond the ShipIt work during the Atlassian Connect week in Amsterdam this year. Now we're ready to launch our fully fledged Cloud add-on.Why it's specialScriptRunner for JIRA Cloud allows you to extend the functionality of JIRA Cloud, executing scripts to interact with JIRA as Post Functions or Event Listeners. Scripts can take actions such as updating an issue during a transition or performing a calculation and storing the result in a custom field on the issue. Administrators have the power of the Groovy programming language at their disposal to respond to events and transitions, manipulating JIRA using the REST API.It also allows admins and power users to quickly extend JIRA Cloud functionality to support your business processes in your workflows by scripting post functions without the hassle of writing a fully-fledged Connect Add-on.Features include:Run your own customised Groovy scripts from the Script Console in your JIRA Cloud instanceBuilt-in ScriptCopy Custom Field ValuesBuilt-in Workflow Post Functions likeClone IssueCreate SubtaskConditionally Fast-Track Transition an IssueTransition Parent IssueModify IssueExamplesDo a calculation using existing custom fields and update a calculated fieldPost a message to HipChat room based on a specific updated issue eventScript ListenersCalculated Custom FieldPost to HipChat based on a Version Release eventCreate Issues whenever a project is created (automatically)Extend the JIRA notifications based on specific fields changing in an issueChallenges we ran intoScripts in ScriptRunner Cloud do not execute within the same process as JIRA and so must interact with JIRA using the REST APIs rather than the JAVA APIs. Atlassian Connect is also inherently asynchronous which means that when a script executes the user may see the page load before the script has completed.Asynchronous execution is at the heart of the Atlassian Connect Framework that ScriptRunner must use to extend JIRA Cloud. JIRA fires webhooks when events and transitions occur and any user interface elements are loaded in iframes. It is not possible to veto, cancel or otherwise prevent JIRA performing an action using ScriptRunner. Scripts themselves are written synchronously, that is REST API calls are made in a blocking style (although async methods are provided too).All user provided code is executed in an isolated container. ScriptRunner for JIRA Cloud is a service that is shared by many customers so isolation is very important that when executing scripts. Isolation is a goal that has been core to the design of ScriptRunner for JIRA from its inception. Each customer has a container that is theirs and theirs only.

Atlassian Connect is also inherently asynchronous which means that when a script executes the user may see the page load before the script has completed.Asynchronous execution is at the heart of the Atlassian Connect Framework that ScriptRunner must use to extend JIRA Cloud. JIRA fires webhooks when events and transitions occur and any user interface elements are loaded in iframes. It is not possible to veto, cancel or otherwise prevent JIRA performing an action using ScriptRunner. Scripts themselves are written synchronously, that is REST API calls are made in a blocking style (although async methods are provided too).All user provided code is executed in an isolated container. ScriptRunner for JIRA Cloud is a service that is shared by many customers so isolation is very important that when executing scripts. Isolation is a goal that has been core to the design of ScriptRunner for JIRA from its inception. Each customer has a container that is theirs and theirs only.

"TempLists: To-Do List Templates for Every Occasion","To-do list templates for everything from travel to pet care. Select a template, customize &amp; export it to Trello.","[3697, ""to-do list templates for every occasionWe write, discard and rewrite to-do lists for the recurring events in life (air travel, road trips, hosting house guests, etc). Even with so much list-making experience, our to-do lists never ever get any better. They might even get worse if you forget a task or two.We're tossing our to-do lists aside instead of refining and reusing them - which leads to ineffective lists.What It DoesWith TempLists, simply select a to-do list template you need. Customize a template to make it your own. You can save it to be used again and again.The next time you take a road trip or flight, your checklist is right here. You can continue to iterate on your lists making them better each time.The Best PartExport your lists to Trello in one click!Name your Trello board and watch your tasks appear as cards with to-do, doing and done lists!FavoritesYou can favorite any of the templates by clicking the heart icon - these templates will be stored in your Favorites section. (If you travel frequently, go ahead and heart those travel templates!)My TemplatesYou can modify the templates (edit, add or delete tasks) to make the list your own - and then you can save your version for future use (which can be found under 'My Templates').Your lists are sure to get better each time, and so will all your adventures.How I built itI used the following technologies:Node.jsSASSReactJSReduxFirebaseDockerWebpackBabelAWSTrello APIChallenges I ran intoOne interesting challenge I faced was when I first exported a list to Trello, the cards created for each task, loaded in asynchronously.

"In The Loop","Live-Updated News Aggregating Web App","[5964, 'Following the recent tragic attacks in Paris, Beirut, and other places, the world has seen the chaos that followed during and after the events. We saw how difficult it was for people to find everything they wanted to know as they searched through dozens of articles and sites to get a full perspective on these trending topics. We wanted to make learning everything there is to know about trending topics effortless. ', ""Our app provides varied information on trending topics aggregated from multiple news sources. Each article is automatically generated and is an aggregation of excerpts from many sources in such a way that there is as much unique information as possible. Each article also includes insights on the attitude of the writer and the political leaning of the excerpts and overall article.ProcedureTrending topics are found on twitter (in accordance to pre-chosen location settings).Find top 30 hits in each topic's Bing results.Parse each article to find important name entities, keywords, etc. to be included in the article.Use machine learning and our scripts to select unique excerpts and images from all articles to create a final briefing of each topic.Use machine learning to collect data on political sentiment and positivity.All of this is displayed in a user-friendly web app which features the articles on trending topics and associated data visualizations. "", 'We began with the idea of aggregating news together in order to create nice-looking efficient briefings, but we quickly became aware of the additional benefits that could be included into our project. Notably, data visualization became a core focus of ours when we realized that the Indico API was able to provide statistics on emotion and political stance. Using Charts.JS and EmojiOne, we created emoticons to indicate the general attitude towards a topic and displayed the political scattermap of each and every topic. These allow us to make very interesting finds, such as the observation that Sports articles tend to be more positive than breaking news. Indico was also able to provide us with mentioned locations, and these was subsequently plugged into the Google Places API to be verified and ultimately sent to the Wolfram API for additional insight.A recurring object of difficulty within our project was ranking, where we had to figure out what was ""better"" and what was not. Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that keywords and points were scatted across all paragraphs within a news story. A challenge in itself, a solution came to our minds. If we matched each and every paragraph to each and every keyword, a graph was formed and all we needed was maximal matching! Google gods were consulted, programming rituals were done, and we finally implemented Kuhn\'s Max Matching algorithm to provide a concise and optimized matching of paragraphs to key points. This recurring difficulty presented itself once again in terms of image matching, where we initially had large pools (up to 50%) of our images being logos, advertisements, and general unpleasantness. While a filtering of specific key words and image sizes eliminated the bulk of our issues, the final solution came from an important observation made by one of our team members: Unrelated images generally have either empty of poorly constructed alt tags. With this in mind, we simply sorted our images and the sky cleared up for another day. The list of technicalities:Implemented Kuhn\'s Max MatchingUsed Python Lambda expressions for quick and easy sortingAdvanced angular techniques and security filters were used to provide optimal experiencesExtensive use of CSS3 transforms allowed for faster and smoother animations (CSS Transforms and notably 3D transforms 1. utilize the GPU and 2. do not cause page content rerendering)Responsive design with Bootstrap made our lives easierIonic Framework was used to quickly and easily build our mobile applicationsOur Python backend script had 17 imports.
