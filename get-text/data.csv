"Pipe Crawler","Robot that follows pipes in search of leaks.","[4098, 'We realized it was difficult to inspect some pipes, and it would be an interesting project to make a robot that could follow pipes and navigate around obstacles to inspect the pipe remotely ', 'A robot travels along a 3"" pipe with a sensor package including sonar and an air quality monitor ', ""Moving through several iterations of the robot throughout the night, we settled on our design due to time and material restrictions. The robot was mainly built with hand tools and scraps from Harvard's machine shop. "", 'A shortage of parts drove us to change our design a few times. The available sensors did not enable us to detect the size of the leaks and integrating a web page into Arduino code was also a challenge. Trying to get live numeric data from the robot was difficult. Building a drive train to maneuver the robot was taxing. Prototyping robotic arms was challenging too. Determining tensile strength for robot parts expended a lot of fabrication time.   ', ""At this hackathon, we learned how to use SparkFun's ESP32 Thing using WiFi. We solved the problem of detection of holes using SONAR and Air Quality Index(CCS811) Sensor. We managed to connect HTML to Arduino code without using microSD card. We used a meta tag to constantly get live feed to detect pipes and cracks. We used a gear reduction to use a high speed motor to power our low speed drive wheel therefore, building a drive train. We prototyped the arms with different low risk materials. After prototyping, we slimmed down the design using mathematical analysis, therefore, creating functional arms. There was intense testing to determine the final robotic parts.  "", ""Techniques learned for future fabrication:Using Computer Aided Design to lay out the construction before hand could have revealed issues before time was spent building. We could also utilize 3D printing and laser cutting to quickly manufacture parts. The micro controller on the Arduino runs into issues with latency when uploading data over WiFi to a web server.New techniques we learned during this challenge:Learned how to program a web server on a microcontroller. Soldered pin headers to breakout boards. Learned how to  design gear ratios and drive trains. Learned manufacturing techniques for different materials. Learned to use SparkFun's ESP32 micro controller. "", 'Computer aided analysis to determine the center of gravity and design future iterations to balance properly. Tighter part tolerances would also aid in this. 3D printing and laser cutting would be integral in this process. Moving the sensor package off of a breadboard would clean up our data. It would be good to find a way to store the data, as currently it is displayed and then overwritten.

"Tobii Ghost - Eye Tracking Twitch Extension","An extension that allow viewers to see where the streamer is looking at the screen. ","[6731, 'Tobii is the world leader in eye tracking technology. Founded in 2001, the company has built its reputation on providing millions of families with the tools it needs in order to better communicate. Eye tracking was born as a research tool, but soon exploded in the specialty market where users were able to communicate using our products (Watch Sebastian Story). Since then we have uncovered countless uses for this technology.The inspiration for Tobii Ghost came about whilst watching speech tablet users, We soon realized that we were trying to guess what they were trying to say just before they actually said it, giving us a visual representation of user intention.With this thought formed and being avid gamers ourselves, we began toying with the idea with the belief that this had great potential ONLY IF we were able to have a good visualization tool to display exactly where and what a person is looking at.Challenges we ran intoBack then we didn’t have a good visualization tool for eye movements on screen. However, there did exist a lot of experiments such as Dwell-Free that allowed us to trace a succession of actions based on heat maps. Whilst innovative, it wasn’t really suited to gaming. We needed something less intrusive and based on what we experienced, heatmaps were a step in the right direction in terms of achieving fluency.So, we accelerated the decay of the heatmap and that created a kind of a waterdrop effect in the screen (The first bubble!). We then created a different variation of that technique that ended up being the customization feature in our extension. After that things gathered steam. We showcased the functionality to Eleague and we were promoted in a  ""Getting Technical"" segment that became quite popular in the show. After that (by content creators/streamers request), we made this a streaming tool. Accomplishments that we are proud ofThe 2nd challenge came when we had the option to transform this streaming tool as an extension, by that time twitch was working in a new version of their extension store showcasing a new way of visualizing extensions in categories,  that will boost discovery for newcomers. Of course, we did not want to lose this opportunity, but we had 3 weeks to research how to build this and actually do it!Also, we have no branding at all, we call it internally the ""Gaze overlay"", so we had to have that in mind too and what was more difficult by then: ""How we can help our users to explain to their viewers that the bubble means eye tracking?"". It was a huge challenge, a very exciting one with a lot of office hour but also with a ton of fun since we were doing something that no one has seen before in gaming and/or eye tracking :) We have seen an amazing reception that been translated into a great exponential organic growth. This has not only allowed us to expand in streamers numbers but also has open doors in esports events as a broadcasting tool: Rainbow Six US Invitationals   ', 'Empowers the viewer with the ability to see where the streamer is looking in the screen.

"PocDoc","It puts healthcare in your hands. ","[4149, ""Traditionally when patients leave in-patient care, they are sent home with a long and incomprehensible set of printed instructions for at-home care. The information provided is not organized or designed with regard to the patient's perspective and leads to many problems.This outdated format limits the patient and their caretakers' access to important information about prescriptions, daily therapy regiments, and the course of their recovery.For many diseases, preventing future medical emergencies is key. For example, patients that have suffered a stroke are at an increased risk of experiencing another in the first year. After leaving the hospital, these patients need to follow a strict regiment of medication and therapy. Without patients' thorough understanding of their disease and its treatment, the risk of suffering a second stroke is increased.Another major drawback of the traditional format of patient education is the lack of dialogue between patients and their healthcare providers. If patients have questions and concerns, they will have to call through the hospital or wait until their next scheduled appointment, which can often be months away. Patients slowly lose control of their healthcare, which can lead to serious issues in mental health and hinder their recovery.With this app, we hope to better prepare patients and their loved ones for the transition back to a healthy life and empower them to control their own healthcare.

"Stream Closed Captioner","Easily increase the accessibility of your stream by adding Closed Captioning for your viewers","[4703, 'I was first inspired to create a Twitch Extension like this when attending a panel by Suz Hinton (@noopkat) at Twitch Con 2017. She mentioned she was an advocate for accessibility on the web and wanted to try doing Closed Captioning on Twitch. This seeded the idea in my mind and I had it in the back of my head for a long time. Before the hackathon I started to notice broadcasters using a Closed Captioning browser source in their OBS setups, a simple section on their stream overlays dedicated to displaying speech to text closed captioning for their viewer. Seeing this rekindled the idea in the back of my mind and when the call went out for this hackathon I thought that the time was right to tackle trying to do the same but doing it as a Twitch extension video overlay that will be configurable and increase user engagement. ', 'Twitch extension video overlay that will display Closed Captioning to the viewer with the only requirement that the broadcaster uses a companion site to do the speech to text translation. All the broadcaster has to do is install the extension, enable it, login to stream-cc.gooseman.codes and click ""On"" when they go live. Once it\'s on viewers will see Closed Captioning being display on stream that they can hide or move around, with future features coming soon.  ', 'The extension front end was built using standard web UI technologies with ReactJS. The Companion site is a standard Ruby On Rails application hosted on Elastic Beanstalk. When a broadcaster signs in using a Chrome browser (Firefox support for Speech To Text is on the Mozilla roadmap) and they click ""On"". The browser will start listening to broadcasters mic and convert speech to text at near real time speeds. From there I send that information to the Server over a websocket when it passes though a simple profanity filter and then relays the payload to the broadcaster channel using the Twitch PubSub API endpoint. Now all viewers of the channel will receive the the Closed Captioning text to display. Since all viewers have a different latency to the broadcaster before displaying the text, I check the users HLS video latency and delay the display of the text for the amount of time. This helps to keep the text as in sync as possible with the broadcasters voice. ', 'One of the biggest challenges I encountered with solving the issue of the Closed Captioning being positioned in a location that was blocking a viewers experience. I grappled with a couple of ideas of having preset locations a broadcaster can set to position the CC where they would like it. But not all streams are created equal and having presets will not solve all peoples issues. I then realized, why not put it the power of the user to move the position of the CC text? So I added the ability to drag around the text on the viewer side so they can tailor the experience for themselves. This simple solution made me happy since now its in the power of the viewer on how they want to see the CC text. ', 'I am just proud I was able to build this extension using the APIs Twitch has offered. It works and it was fun building it. ', 'I learned a lot about AWS and deploying a Ruby on Rails application, I never actually built and deployed anything on my own. I also learned a lot more more about the Twitch Extension API and the data available through it. ', 'There are a lot of features I want to prototype and build for the extension.A couple ideas I like to prototype for broadcaster:Downloadable transcripts of their CC sessionEnable text translation for another language, ie. Korean language streamer enables translating text from Korean to English. A viewer will then be able to toggle betweenBroadcaster can customize the font used for the closed captioning textWhen a broadcaster says the name of an emote its could display the emote on screen or replace the text with the emoteVoice activated overlay eventsIdeas for the viewer experience side of the extension:Bit enabled actions/events with the textPay bits to cause the spoken text to rain down from the top of the screen and pile up for a period of timeStill thinking about other ideas that users can trigger with bits but not at the cost of ruining the closed captioning experience for others.

"Real Estate","A conversational search for real estate listings in your area","[3837, ""When I first learned Alexa was open-sourced, I wanted to get one. In a deal with my dad, he gave me an Amazon Echo, and I started developing an app for him. As a real estate broker, he wanted me to build a properties' search. The final product was pretty cool, and we both saw its potential. "", 'Our Alexa skill asks you a series of questions to navigate your search to find houses and properties you might be interested in. Alexa then can send you an email with a link to your graphical results.  ', 'I wrote the voice app in Java and host it as a lambda function. It uses DynamoDB to store session data and information about the app. Each time a user loads the app, it looks to see if the user has a prior session saved. Returning users have different options than new users. Once connected with our skill, a returning user experiences a personalized greeting and the ability to redo searches or continue those that may have crashed. Then, I built a server to store user info and return graphical responses in ruby on rails. The server is used for account linking and finding all of the housing data. ', 'Once the code became more complex, I realized it was no longer maintainable in its current form. It needed to be re-written and reorganized in order to be more sustainable. In my experience, voice apps commonly face this challenge because of the endless possible user states and the constant need to anticipate and evolve with them. As you add more questions, the app gets exponentially more complex. The next challenge we faced involved obtaining the data for our skill. Housing data is incredibly fragmented and locked down within the real estate market. It took a lot of time and negotiation to get access to the markets we have now. We currently provide listings in Albany, NY, Boston, MA, Staten Island, NY, Denver, CO, Phoenix, AZ, Virginia Beach, VA, Naples, FL, and the state of Michigan.  ', 'I am proud of the organizational scheme developed in response to the growing complexity of the app. Overtime, we have balanced the intricacy of the app without sacrificing organization or efficiency in the code.  Obtaining the housing data has also been a major point of pride within our small startup. While one of the most challenging parts of this venture, closing the deals and gaining access to that data continues to be one of the most rewarding and exciting parts of developing this app. ', ""I learned that nothing is as straight forward as it should be. At every turn, there was a simple solution and a complex one, but the simple solution was often not an option. We originally wanted to build the voice interface and partner with a pre-existing real estate search company, but that wasn't as easy of a sell as we anticipated. The complex solution was to build our own website and search engine. Just as rewriting the code benefitted the future of our app, so did creating these services ourselves. By controlling all of the aspects of our product, I ensure every piece is the best. "", ""We are constantly acquiring and searching for more housing data. So far in 2017, we've developed and launched our skill on Google Home, reached eight housing markets, spearheaded the addition of voice search to the rules put forward by the National Association of Realtors, and grew our Voiceter team with more great minds.

"Fork On The Road","Try ""Alexa, ask Fork On The Road"" and the fork will help you make a decision.  Alexa Skill that uses dynamic 3D.","[4376, 'A friend of mine told me about the Amazon Multimodal Contest, #AmazonAlexaMultimodalChallenge, and I thought I\'d take a stab at making my first Alexa Skill.  While researching the Amazon Presentation Language I looked for inspiration in my daily life to guide my direction.  One evening, my family and I were trying to decide on what movie we would watch.  This sparked the idea of a fun and interactive decision maker.  Thus was born, ""Fork On The Road"".  ', 'The skill is invoked with ""Alexa, ask Fork On The Road"".  Users are asked to add up to four things for the fork to choose from.  Users can also remove items they\'ve added.  While users are adding things, an animation of the fork bounces in the intersection of two roads.  A full 3D scene is used to present items in a fun and unique way, with items placed as dynamic 3D extruded text.  When there as at least 2 items the user can ""Spin the Fork"".  When the fork is choosing, it bounces up and spins around, slowly stopping on the path it would like you to take.  A final screen presents the forks decision using another dynamic 3D scene.  This skill works responsively across all Alexa products ranging from speech-only to TV.  ""Your destiny awaits.  Enjoy!"" ', 'This project was created using several different technologies.  It primarily uses open-source and Amazon platforms.  The key technology is Amazon\'s APL.  The APL is designed using several layers of APL Components, including APL Video, that are sequenced with SendEvent Commands and Document Directives.  Document transforms, game logic and speech response is managed using the ASK SDK for Node.js running on Lamba.  Skill configuration for invocations, utterances, intents, lambda, etc, are maintained and deployed through a Skill Manifest and the ASK CLI.  Resources and Assets come from two different sources.  Static files are hosted on S3 with a Cloudfront instance on top.  Dynamic assets, like the dynamically generated 3D scene, are requested from a Lambda service with API Gateway routing requests.  This dynamic asset service uses a Headless Chrome Node API called Puppeteer to load a website, take a screen capture, and send it back to the Alexa device with a ""image/png"" header.  The captured website uses Three.js to dynamically construct a scene based on the variables in the request and composes elements such as extruded text.  Animations were also scripted in Three.js and then captured, cropped and embedded in the APL. The 3D scene was first composed in Unity to get the look and feel correct and then exported.  Finally, the fork\'s sound effect was composed in Sony Acid Pro using a couple of layered sounds and exported to the appropriate MP3 specs using Audacity.Enlarge ImageEnlarge Image ', 'The Amazon APL is off to a great start but the games visual sequences will most likely be easier to accomplish once there are more APL Commands and Component options. ', ""I really enjoyed figuring out the dynamic asset service as this opened up a slew of opportunities for unique visual experiences.  This type of feature can be used in many different ways to provide a composited image to provide visual data.  For instance, the Size or Atmosphere graphs in Amazon's Sample Space Explorer Skill. "", ""Lots!  In the past I've done very light research into Alexa Skills but this was a full-blown exercise to see how far I could push the APL's user-perceived visual interface.

"Suju - suju.online","On demand self-driving buses using multi-parameter route optimizing aimed to help event and public transportation.","[5906, ""Our team members are hyped about Machine Learning and UX. We were intrigued by the Sohjoa virtual bus stops challenge. It allowed us to design a bus service we would love to use ourselves: a cheap but efficient alternative for the taxi/uber. We wanted to hack a bunch of state of the art tech together to show how a dynamic bus service could work.The problemEvent organizers have trouble getting their attendees to the event venue. Public transportation may not be enough and organizing custom transportation is expensive and time-consuming. The best practice for custom transportation so far is to organize a route from a pre-defined point X to the venue using a pre-defined schedule. The customers will still have to travel to point X before they can use the arranged transportation. They will have to schedule their day based on the transportation's schedule. If they don't want to deal with these problems they can choose to use their own car or get a taxi/UBER, which gets expensive really fast.  Technically, this kind of problem is often referred to as the last mile problem. We wanted to tackle a variation of this: the first mile problem. Even with just some tens of passengers there are millions of possible routes between them, let alone when a third variable, time, is taken into account.The solutionOur project for Junction 2016 aims to solve the transportation problem by using Sohjoa to organize dynamic and cost controlled custom transportation. Our concept is a tool for event organizers and public transportation decision makers that allows them to design dynamic routing for the self-driving bus. If the surroundings of a location are pre-scanned the bus can plan and drive routes that are planned on-the-go.  Our tool makes the required optimizations to the route, chooses a smart way to transport people from their desired pick-up location and tells Sohjoa which route and schedule to follow during the transportation. The use cases1) Event transportationEvents organize group transportation to boost visitor counts. Doing this in a cost efficient way is what really matters. Unlike public transportation there is a more clear business model: people bring in money, so it is worth investing money to bring them to the event. Our routing algorithm allows prioritization by cost, which means that people can be transported on a price per visitor basis.2) The commuter's first mileCurrently public transportation is organized around node points such as railway or metro stations. However, the last mile or so is often the most unconvinient for a commuter. Busses to less populated areas leave seldomly and can't stop at everyones home. Our service can create efficient routes that transport everyone from and to the general area of their home - adjusting dynamically to demand thus being able to take the shortest route to the destination.  The techThe service is running on a node.js server, with React and Redux used for the web UI. Our algorithms are written in Python so we can leverage state of the art Machine Learning libraries.1) Clustering user data  - Recursive DBSCAN machine learning algorithm to reduce the complexity of the spacetime data.2) Sjukstra routing  - Customized Djikstra that takes into account cost-factors that are specific to electric buses3) Routing with EMBERS  - Leveraging Embers route planning to get fast routes between virtual bus stops4) Data visualisation with leaflet  - Intuitive and easy to use planning and visualisation tool for virtual bus stops5) Telegram (SujuBot) end user demo  - Example of an end user UI. Helps envision how the service would look for an end user.  AccomplishmentsThe project required long hours and took our very best effort. In the end, even though at times we had problems and didn't always feel like we were progressing, we were able to create a prototype of a service that helps better imagine what is possible and how shared transportation could work. We have coded through the entire night and currently have our fingers crossed that our pitcher will stay awake through Sunday.Our main challenges were parametrizing and developing algorithms to solve the initial routing problem, we had to develop them almost from scratch. Integrating our different parts to a seamless and consistent service took lots of time and effort. Lastly, it was difficult to prioritize and scope a presentable MVP, the problem was complex and had numerous points of possible failure.What's nextOur project is left open ended. It could be taken towards multiple of development directions, but only time will tell. We hope that during the judging phase we will get inspiring suggestions or feedback on our project.Built Withazuredbscanemberses6leaflet.jsnode.jsnumpypostgresqlpythonradixreactreduxsassscikit-learntelegramTry it outsuju.onlinegithub.com      Submitted to    Junction 2016Winner                Main Prize              Winner                Embers Challenge              Winner                Sohjoa Robotbus Challenge              Winner                Track Finalists                  Created by  Deployed code to server, consulted algorithms and added very small touches on the frontend.Aleksi JokelaI developed some front endJere VaaraThe mom of the team.

Or maybe Skype nickname? Whatever way you choose, you will still find yourself linking that person on more social media afterwards. Why not do it in one go with an easy-to-use app?What if you have to meet new people for business all the time? Then, your life turns into endless flow of business cards with no real structure and a simple way to organise it! Our app aims to become your electronic business card library and your business card on the go: search both your home and work contacts easily and have your business card with you wherever you go. Avoid the hassle with paper business cards!How it worksA person downloads an app and goes through a simple sign-up process that allows to add personal and work contacts like Facebook, LinkedIn etc. (only Email Address is implemented right now). Afterwards, the person takes a personal picture to be used for face recognition (in future, the Face Recognition library will be also filled up with profile images from added social networks). Ready to go!Recognising someone and adding a their contacts is as easy as taking a picture of that person!Challenges we ran intoFace recognition doesn't really work well - different camera configurations, different lighting or even haircut and glasses screwed up the process. Thus, in the future, we need to add more reliable identification techniques like Fingerprint recognition (when the devices are equipped appropriately) with a fallback to techniques like NFC, Bluetooth or QR Code scanning.Having a centralised server for all the functionality means that we can roll out updates and have total control over the core of our app. However, it also means that the app can't function offline or if the server goes down. Meanwhile, doing Face recognition on the device is difficult due to all the SDKs out there (some of which are limited to the processor chips, e.g., Snapdragon SDK).Using Ionic and Cordova for making an app was a really good choice due to rapid view design process, but the framework sometimes behaves unexpectedly on the actual device. Lack of on-device JavaScript debugging makes development quite a horrifying process.Accomplishments that we're proud ofWe were advised to have a look at Parse backend-as-a-service and it worked out really great for us. Our backend server is just a single file with less than 250 lines of code!Doing a complex app that interacts with a server, uses camera and Face recognition only by means of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript is exciting and is quite an accomplishment on its own. A couple of years ago we never could imagine using thick technology stack in such a way!What we learnedWe had no prior experience in Ionic or Face recognition, so we learnt a great deal. We applied Ionic framework to bootstrap a simple cross-platform app really quickly. We discovered Parse - great alternative to managing your own database. We figured out the ins and outs of Face recognition with current technologies.What's next for Ice BreakerRefactoring! And lots of it! App in it's current state is very much a fragile prototype, so we need to improve it's code quality. Changing the app engine from Ionic to something like Xamarin.Forms (more native yet still cross-platform) will improve the performance and may give us a chance to use the some on-device Face recognition techniques.Adding more contact sources will always remain needed (especially right now, when we only have a single email) - integration with all the social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Google+ (for personal contacts) and LinkedIn (for work contacts) is crucial.What if you already have a collection of Business Cards?

"Gradebook","Gradebook is a scalable, cross-platform information learning system analytics platform for high school students.","[6004, ""A business that makes nothing but money is a poor business.Henry FordWe weren't inspired by some life-changing experience, or by a vision to be the greatest in all of history.As students, we wanted more from our grade data. So we created the first solution.How it worksThe best way to experiment is through daily utility -- so that'sexactly how we've setup our first version.The first version of The Gradebook is built as an extension of the learning information platform Infinite Campus. In setting our application up this way, we can access existing student data, building up our platform on a system that our own school uses to store grade data.When a student signs into their school portal, we use the existing API to download all of their grade data, then we reorganize it in a way that makes it more visually pleasing, easier to understand, and more navigable.FunctionalityTheoretical Grading: Your grading platform should extend beyond the present -- we make that happen. With theoretical grading, you can add in future grades to see how it would affect your existing grade. Don't get blindsided by critical grade dumps that change your grade.Built-In Notifications: When you open the application, you're presented with any new updates to your grades. Click on any notification to immediately scroll to that class.Beautiful User Interface: Our user interface minimizes convolution while focusing on what matters most. The app is just a frame, your grades are the real content.Faster Refresh Rates: Because we solely focus on grades, we can grab your data faster. As soon as we have all of your raw grade data, we cut off the stream, minimizing data usage and maximizing download times. No extra student information is downloaded, giving us an edge over traditional platforms.Extreme Ubiquity: Our app is available on iOS and Android, with user interfaces specific to each platform. Download it at grdbk.comChallengesSince there aren't any other products in our market, we had to paveour own path.Information Learning SystemThe world of student gradebook data is a battle of the big companies: Powerschool, Infinite Campus, and many other solutions are going to head-to-head with claims over parts of the American education system. That level of fragmentation made it hard to determine where to start. Since our school,  Adlai E. Stevenson High School, uses Infinite Campus, we started with that.Initial RoleOur end goal is to provide broad-variety analytics to both students and teachers regarding overall trends in classes based on the teacher, the school, and pretty much any other possible filter. But that's a bit macroscopic -- so we started small.We decided to start off by just helping students make sense of where their grades are, and where they could be heading. Therefore we built a system that can grab student data and then provide theoretical grading.Student PrivacyStudent data has to be handled extremely responsibly, so we've done our best not to overstep. All data is solely stored locally and all calculations are done on the device in real-time. We want to shift over to a server (in beta), but we want more help and to invest more time into developing a secure server-client infrastructure first.Bug FixesWe have a small team of 3 active students, balancing our coding lives with all of our extracurriculars and academics. We often find ourselves staying up late trying to solve bugs only to find out there are more that have been discovered. Everyone is in extremely unique grading situations, and we often find ourselves tweaking our code to deal with unanticipated situations.DemographicsThough our market is the entire student population in America, we can't reach them all at once. For now, we've limited our marketing and setup to our school community: Adlai E. Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire, Illinois.

"", 'SCTS stands for ""Supply Chain Tracking System"". STCS is a Smart Contract framework to keep tracking of products from the raw materials to the shopping stage.

The community in charge of SCTS (could be a government, a consortium or even a DAO) can register this account as official SCTS Product Handlers, so their identity is stored in the Blockchain being impossible for fake producers or suppliers to cheat and sell products in the name of a registered Brand.Because of this, any costumer, government or regulatory institution can scan a QR code in the product packaging, which identifies the Smart Contract representing the exact unit of the Product, or even introduce the address of the Smart Contract, and be able to track and audit all the life of the Product.But there\'s more. Anyone will be also able to introduce the code of a SCTS Product Handler and see all the actions this individual or institution has performed on SCTS Products, empowering a more transparent and fair global economic system.

This was followed with a small conversation where we spoke to Chris about all different tasks they plan to complete on IoT for example triggering a coffee machine with the alarm you set to wake yourself up. Me and my teammate spent next few hours discussing different ideas and studying how existing models are working. As this is the Tornado season at Manhattan we decided to go ahead with the idea to create a weather Alert system using existing hardware and APIs. How we built itWe spent initial hours discussing various interesting ideas we came up with and wrote designs for few of them. This was followed by feasibility discussion of these ideas :D . Finally we decided to work on weather Alert system. After finalizing the design we decided to make a mobile application. It was getting difficult to decide platforms to work and therefore we came up with an idea of a web-based application.  We wrote the code on HTML and PHP and used LIFX and OpenWeatherMap APIs . We have implemented following functionalities.Switching Lights On/OffSetting lights to desired colors.Control brightness of the light.Implemented Special Effects - Pulse effectsWeather Alert - This is the most vital functionality. Using current user location (Longitude and Latitude ) we fetch data from OpenWeatherMap. This returns JSON data with different details about weather. There are three major categories of weather status returned - Clouds , Rain and Clear. When status is ""Rain"" we invoke a pulse notification with Blue color that notifies user of Rain. If the weather status is Clouds we give a mild purple color pulse. This indications help user to stay updated without looking at their digital devices. As this is a visual stimulus it quickly grabs user attention and saves them from missing any update (SMS or alarms can be overlooked if they are silent or in other rooms).

"Unofficial Devpost API","The unofficial part means I probably won't fix it when it breaks.","[3735, 'I was inspired by the innovative tools that I was learning about at the most recent AWS Summit here in New York (Checkout the presentations on SlideShare and Youtube if you haven\'t already.)I knew that I wanted to use AWS Lambda to run ""Event-Driven Code in the Cloud"" as they put it, and when they showed us how simple it was to create an HTTP endpoint for your Lambda functions the first thing that sprung to mind was a scraper that would take Devpost pages and return JSON.How it worksIt\'s a little quirky to work with since you\'ll need to make POST requests in order to retrieve your data as JSON, since the new API Gateway/Lambda combination doesn\'t seem to have anyway to support URL parameters yet. Here is the example CURL command I would execute to scrape my portfolio:$ curl -X POST -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d \'{""screen_name"":""MGerrior""}\' https://iii3mdppm7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/UserPortfolioEndpointObviously you will want to replace my screen name with your screen name to obtain data related to you. It\'s not built as a crawler yet, so it will only return information that is visible when you first view your portfolio on Devpost.The API uses Amazon\'s new API Gateway that provides built in caching and throttling out of the box. The API endpoint is the hooked up to a Lambda function that is executed when the request is received. The Lambda function then scrapes the page, formats it as a JSON response, and returns it to the API Gateway which subsequently returns it to you.Challenges I ran intoOne of the challenges that I ran into was finding resources for learning how to work with these tools. They\'re both fairly new services (API Gateway was just announced at the summit a week ago), so finding resources online outside of the official docs was not easy. I additionally ran into some issues with the Grunt tasks I was using from grunt-aws-lambda since it was producing empty zip files for me to upload to Lambda, but I eventually just zipped the files myself.Accomplishments that I\'m proud ofI\'m pretty proud that I was able to get this up and running in just a few hours as part of Dev Thursday here at Devpost.What I learnedI learned that I hate writing Java. As of right now AWS Lambda mainly supports two runtime environments which are node.js and Java. I couldn\'t figure out how to get NPM modules loaded in Lambda (Save yourself some time, just read this) so I decide I would just use Java instead and take advantage of all the built-in libraries, or so I thought. After struggling with Eclipse, and then struggling to install the AWS SDK for Eclipse (something something Data Tools Platform?), I switched back to node.js and bundled the npm modules as a ZIP file thanks to the guide above.What\'s next for Unofficial Devpost APII want to figure out how to add CORS headers to the responses from the API Gateway so that developers on Devpost can integrate this data into third party sites such as their portfolio by doing something as simple as:$.post(""https://iii3mdppm7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/UserPortfolioEndpoint"", {screen_name: ""MGerrior""}, function(data) {  // Add your projects to the DOM});If you try that right now the request will fail for security purposes since the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is not set in the response.Also, it wouldn\'t hurt for this to have more endpoints, or to just build an actual API for Devpost.Built Withamazon-web-servicesaws-api-gatewayaws-lambdacheerio.jsgrunt-aws-lambdagrunt.jshtmljavascriptnode.jsnpmrequest      Submitted to    Your First API | Summer Jam    Created by  Matthew GerriorSenior Software Engineer @ Devpost ', ' ', ' ', ""One of the challenges that I ran into was finding resources for learning how to work with these tools.

"BackPack","SAVE MORE ENJOY MORE","[2739, 'We all love money hacks. When it comes to renting a room during a visit to a place is a waste of money. We usually use a hotel room for refreshment and rest purpose which is fulfilled in at max 3-4 hours of stay. This waste our money as we have to pay for the whole day but there is solution for it. ', ""Backpack will maintain a dynamic record of hotel rooms. People here will be able to book rooms on basis of hour and they have to pay accordingly(not the whole price). Then can have there flexible schedule.How does it help out customer and hotelSuppose the rent of the hotel for $200 for a day. But if the person books through BACKPACK he has to pay as low as $40 as for 2 hours. The hotel will also gain profit because rooms are empty to book again. In this way on hotel end they can make more than $200 per day and at the customers end one has to pay a small sum.Revenue Generation For The CompanyAs per the scalability and different timings of year we would impose revenue from 3% to 12% of the total amount taken from our customers . A major share of revenue generation will be this and soon some pro features would be available which only people with our prime membership could access.How we will build itIt will be available on android ,web and iOS platforms .Team will consist 4 departments :-1 ) Collecting resources - arrangement of incubation center 2) Coding - skill developers working at both back end and front end3 ) Advertising - making contacts with the people and the hotel (very first will be bani park)4 ) Sales management - this team will keep an eye on market and accordingly changes the rent of roomsChallenges We ran intoThere are some loop holes like justifying the price of the hotel. Maintaining of hotel standards becomes difficult when there is checkout every 2 to 3 hours. It can create a whole lot of trouble to those hotels which have a large number of rooms. And at the same time dynamic data analysing is the soul of the backend of Backpack.Accomplishments that We are proud ofWe think this idea can break the pre-existing idea of 12-12 and also can be a good competitor of OYO like companies in coming days.What We learnedOverall it is good experience of finally seeing the idea come into reality.

"WiSign","WiSign is an ios app designed for people to learn fingerspelling in American Sign Language. We want to provide people with chances for communicating and understanding Deaf community with its culture.","[7540, ""Siyuan: Being a person who identified as a Hard of Hearing student in UW-Madison, I was aware that many people did have stereotypes against Deaf or Hard of Hearing(DHOH) people. Many people consider the DHOH community as an isolated community and they hope DHOH people could communicate with hearing people by spoke language. However, in Deaf culture, many DHOH people really enjoy communicating with others and they love to use American Sign Language (ASL) to engage in communication. Therefore, I want to use a mobile app to help people who are interested in ASL to improve their fingerspelling skills.Harry: As a person grow up with a cochlear implant, I can feel the world with sound or not. It's a very special experience and I want people to learn more about this special group. A mobile app would be a perfect platform to learn some interesting facts about the deafness, so I took Siyuan's invitation immediately when she asked me to join.Yuren: Actually, I did not meet many DHOH people before I came to Madison for undergraduate study. After I came here, I met and made friends with different people within the DHOH community. The more I get in touch with this community, the more I want to learn about it. Therefore, when Siyuan asked me whether I wanted to join her for this project, I joined without hesitation. "", 'WiSign is divided into two main functions, Quiz and StudyQuizThis function test how the user learns the fingerspelling in ASL. We fulfill this aim by testing how users identify different words by fingerspelling, combinations of signed alphabets, in different length-of-word ranges and send the words they inaccurately identify to review words list. Users can choose one of the four modes: easy, normal, hard, and evil, which contains words with length less than 3 characters, 4 - 6 characters, 7 - 8 characters, and equal or over 9 characters, separately.Our word list is generated from dictionaries in the Github repository and can be found from https://github.com/stoneotaku/vobmaster.git. We developed a python program to filter all the words in the word lists to the length corresponding to the 4 modes.Every word is shown to the users by images of ASL alphabet signs corresponding to characters in the words. The duration of each image is 0.5 seconds.We check how the user learns the fingerspelling in ASL by asking them to type the words they see and check whether they identify each sign accurately. The test input is not case sensitive. If the user enters the correct answer, the app will swift to the next question automatically. Otherwise, the current question will be added to the review words list and the images will be displayed again for users. The users can also put the current question directly to the review words list and see the answer directly. Users can take as many quizzes as they want.StudyThe study section has two parts, Study A - Z and Review.Study A - Z  part is designed for new ASL learners. They can view all the characters in alphabet order individually.Review part is designed for users to go over words they identified inaccurately or put into review words list during the quizzes. In this part, the images of signs are displayed the same as that in the quiz. However, users are not required to enter the words; instead, they can click the button to see answers directly. Besides, they can choose to remove the words from the review words list if they believe they master this combination of signs. After the user clicks the remove button, the button will change to the button for putting the words back if users remove them mistakenly. ', 'We used Github to work as a team and achieve the goal of version control. Each one of us has a task: Siyuan is responsible for UI of the app, Yuren is responsible for the icon design, string generator and image player, Harry is responsible for icon design, link images to string and view management. We started with simple tasks and tried to add features to our app after debugging the basic version. We always make a plot graph before moving on the next objective. Therefore, we communicate effectively and maximized our learning experience in 24 hours. ', ""We had a lot trouble with Github at first. Sometimes Github can't resolve the conflicts when two person modified same file at the same time . We solved the problem by always asking other teammates what changes they have made before update their own versions to GitHub.It's our first time to program in Swift, so we had to learn everything from scratch and develop this program in 24 hours. We had a lot of difficult times trying to create objects, connecting code with UI design, and switching from different view controller to maintain a good functionalities for our app. "", 'We are totally new to Swift and iOS app development and we developed the app by ourselves in only 24 hours. Also, we designed fantastic icons for our app in representing love and badger pride. ', 'Swift, UI Design, UIKit ', ""The current image speed is set to 0.5 seconds, we hope to update the setting and enable users to set the different speed according to their ability with fingerspelling in ASL.The current UI is only compatible with iPhone XR. We hope to improve the UI and adapt it to all the currently available devices.We believe that daily practice is important than Setting daily goals for the user based on their quiz results. We want to include motivations for users to do so. To do so, we may add sections such as daily challenges, rankings, and archives. We believe it is also of great importance for users to use the actual signs in ASL in addition to identifying longer phase and sentence. Therefore, we hope to use a large number of videos to train models to recognize fingers' and palms' movements by users. In this way, we are able to test whether users can use the actual signs in ASL corresponding to the phrases or even sentences.We want to help connect and enlarge the Deaf Community as well as spreading its culture. We hope to build an online cloud community within WiSign so that ASL users and learners across the world can get in touch with each other better.

"melon","Can't pick the ripest watermelon without splitting it open? Fear not! ""melon"" uses a neural network to predict the quality of watermelons through data collected by sound sensor and impulse deliverer.","[3705, ""We knew from the offset that we wanted to do a hardware-based hack. We began with the several sensors available to us that could interface with the Qualcomm Dragonboard. Of particular interest were vibrational sensors. After considering our options, we settled on using a sound sensor to deduce structural integrity and composition of materials. We decided that a great way to test this technique would be with watermelons. After finding a 2004 paper that empirically demonstrated a relationship between vibrational modes and watermelon quality, we realized that this project would be feasible. While the authors of the paper conducted acoustical analyses, we decided, based on the time available to us and because we felt it was more aligned with the spirit of HackTJ, to use a neural network to differentiate watermelon quality. What It DoesWe prototyped a portable watermelon quality sensing device that delivers a sound producing impulse through a servo and records the corresponding sound. The recorded sound is fed into a trained neural network that determines whether or not the sound corresponds to a higher quality watermelon.How We Built ItFirst, we opened Qualcomm and tried to boot it up. After figuring out how to use the DragonBoard, we began researching how to use the electrical components while also making the neural network. While this was happening, we also brainstormed a procedure to gather data and prototyped an arm that would be attached to the servo, which we later 3D printed. Initially, we used a spy camera and microphone, but because it didn’t work, we switched to using a webcam. Afterward, we collected data using the sensor, fed the data into the neural network to train it, and wired up the actual apparatus.Challenges and AccomplishmentsThe microphone that came with spy camera did not function correctly; the signal obtained from the microphone was not clean, as a result, the .wav file was full of beeping noises that rendered data uselessThe 96Boards that came with Qualcomm DragonBoard was causing kernel panics on the DragonBoard; we solved this by giving the 96boards an additional USB power supplyWanted to do a project on watermelons; did not have watermelons; solved by getting watermelons3D printed arm did not fit onto servo, filed down components so that they fitOvercoming hardware issues by employing gracious professionalism among peers: borrowed camera due to nonfunctional cameraNeural network arrays did not align up: kept fiddling till workedSuccessfully collected dataArtificially created a controlled simulation for bad watermelonServo was not strong enough so we used knuckles to apply consistent sound generating impulse to the watermelonCame up with a fun and challenging project ideaWhat We LearnedHardware problems that can’t be fixedGathering and processing audio data from microphonesLearned that python code can be super annoyingUsing GitHub, transferring dataDifficult to roll watermelonsLearning how to use Qualcomm boardLibrary-specific sensors to DragonBoardImportant to be patient when debuggingWhat's Next For IoT HackTJ ProjectUpgrading hammer/servoA more comprehensive training setExpanding fruit typeCreating a more portable deviceBuilt With3d-printer5inch-hdmi-displayarduinoautodesk-fusion-360c++kuman-ky61-micro-servologitech-c920-webcam/microphonepythonqualcom-dragonboard      Submitted to    Hack TJ 6.0Winner                Best Hardware or Other Hack                  Created by  Sophia Wangrichardwang1124Jude_underscore_BShasty88 "", ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['python', 'qualcom-dragonboard', 'logitech-c920-webcam/microphone', '5inch-hdmi-display', 'kuman-ky61-micro-servo', 'c++', 'arduino', 'autodesk-fusion-360', '3d-printer']","False","27","['sophiawang310', 'richardwang1124', 'jude_underscore_b', 'shasty88']","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/795/011/datas/small.jpg","False","0"

"Sobr","A keyless solution to prevent drunk driving","[8081, ""Sobr was inspired by the large amount of drunk driving accidents in the U.S. In 2017, there were 10,874 deaths due to drunk driving. Sobr aims to reduce this number by preventing intoxicated drivers from stepping behind the wheel to begin with and providing alternative methods of arriving home.What it Does?Sobr is intended to be an accompanying application for drivers to identify whether or not they are intoxicated before driving. It uses a combination of features detected through facial recognition to unlock the car, as long as the driver is classified as sober. If the driver is classified as intoxicated, a second (different) face must be provided to act as a designated driver.How We Built It?We began by scraping data off a dataset of pictures of human subjects before and after they had consumed alcohol. It was rather difficult to find quality datasets of this nature, and so, we had to make do with a small initial sample.Preprocessing DataWith small sample pool of images collected from 53 participants, we are asked to expand the datasets to avoid underfitting the data. First, we train a Haar Cascade Classifier to detect and extract facial features from the images. From there, we turned to image augmentation for machine learning experiments, based on which we write a script to arbitrarily apply 0, 1, or 2 special effects to the original 212 images. This technique of image augmentation allows us to generate a sample pool of 50,000, equally split between positive and negative samples.Research ProblemWe treat this as a binary classification problem where we identify whether or not the subject in the image is inebriated. We use iOS’s Vision API to detect the most prominent face in the input image, crop the corresponding bounding box, and feed this as the input to all our trained ML models.Prediction SystemThe first half of our prediction architecture is an ensemble of deep convolutional neural networks trained on different randomly sampled subsets of the augmented dataset. We observed experimentally that using an ensemble produced a much more robust and reliable result as compared to what we obtained with a single neural network. Every neural net in the ensemble had the same architecture: We have four convolutional layers that use a 3x3 kernel, each followed by a max-pooling layer that subsamples in a 2x2 area with a 2x2 stride. We use relu activations throughout the network and a softmax activation on the last layer. We used cross entropy loss along with stochastic gradient descent to find optimal weights for the neural network. We used high-memory instances from Google Cloud Platform to train our models since we required significant amounts of RAM to do so. After training, we used CoreML’s keras-to-CoreML converter to transform our model to a format that can directly run on an iOS device.Following through with our intention to build a voting classifier out of several different models, we built a classifier out of Microsoft Cognitive Services’ Custom Vision API on the augmented image dataset. We used the General(Compact) model type and used a probability cutoff that resulted in reasonable precision and recall values.Aggregated ClassifiersWe took a simple majority vote out of all the different classifiers that we use. Because this is a binary classification problem and because we intentionally used an odd number of classifiers, there is no possibility of a tie. The input image is classified to contain an inebriated subject(or not) based upon whichever class secures the majority vote.Challenges We Ran IntoWhen augmenting our dataset, we took a single image that contained four separate images and split the image into four separate images. For each image, two of the images were classified as sober and two were classified as drunk. When doing this, two of the images were mixed, causing our data to be skewed when training our models. The odd thing was that it performed better with the incorrectly labelled data.Accomplishments That We're Proud OfSobr was able to correctly classify intoxicated faces at 90.68% on the validation set. We do not at present have a mechanism to measure the App’s performance, but it still performed relatively well in our subjective evaluation. Also, we were able to connect to the SmartCar API in order to send commands back and forth.Our dataset contained just 212 images in total and we successfully trained a deep neural network that performs well on such a small dataset.DNNs are notorious for overfitting in the presence of small datasets and we overcame this problem through rigorous data augmentation and ensembling several models.We also achieved excellent performance on a challenging deep learning task that has not been explored at all by the community in less than 24 hours.We built a complete, end-to-end iOS application that utilizes the ML models that we built.What We've LearnedFrom the perspective of data engineering, we practiced expanding the sample pool with limited amount of public data available. In terms of data science, we obtained experience manually constructing comprehensive dataset from scratch and came to realize the precious value behind such establishment of such enormous datasets. Lastly, it was fascinating to become aware of how computer science can contribute to novelizing a traditional concept from the past to enable for infinite potential and efficacy well beyond the status quo.What's Next for SobrFor the next steps we would like to refine the model in order to provide more accurate results. Along with this, we would like to add more components to the entire system. For example, a camera could be added to the dashboard to insure that the driver of the vehicle is not intoxicated.ReferencesHermosilla, Gabriel, et al. “Face Recognition and Drunk Classification Using Infrared Face Images.” Journal of Sensors, 2018, doi:10.1155/2018/5813514.Koukiou, G., and V.

First, he told me when they reconfigure the operations floor to transition from one work order to the next, usually it impacts any number of workstations, work-centers, machines, conveyors and/or robots, etc.. Sometimes, people and/or machines aren’t always available due to the existing work orders, so they need alternative configuration plans as well. They want a tool that allows them to virtually reconfigure the operations floor for a new work order as well as any alternatives before making the physical changes.Second,  they want to simulate the work order operations (and alternative configuration plans) to forecast a new work order completion date and time.Third, they want a tool that lets them virtually configure and simulate the manufacturing operations when they add or change out equipment, alter operations or come up with new ideas to try. When we learned about the Brilliant Manufacturing Suite, we were ecstatic!  This suite gives us exactly what we need to build a solution that helps this lean manufacturer and others quickly and easily respond to dynamic operational changes virtually. Hence PROS.  ', 'PROS provides operations floor engineers the ability to:Reconfigure and simulate operations virtually in 3D for work orders and the transitions between work orders,View Efficiency Analyzer information associated with the work order operations, Forecast the completion date and time for a work order given the current operations configuration, andRun simulations for what-if scenarios. ', 'PROS was built with the gaming platform Unity as it provides the ability to render and simulate work order operations in an immersive 3D environment. Using this platform will enable us to port this application to other platforms (i.e., browser, mobile, etc.) or run in Virtual and/or Augmented Reality. ', ""Working with new technologies always seems to present challenges.  I can't think of anything we did that didn't have some challenge associated to it.  Some of the more relevant challenges include understanding the API content, integrating with the APIs, figuring out how to associate and integrate API information with a 3D simulation and building the runtime editing capability for the 3D configuration. "", ""I'm proud to have taken an idea from inception to a developed solution leveraging virtual 3D technologies, which was fun in itself, but which also has the additional value of advancing the digital transformation currently underway in manufacturing. It's exciting knowing that this application is a step towards solving challenges in manufacturing today. I'm looking forward to where it is going to take me! "", 'When I started this project I thought I would have an application that was complete. During the process of developing the application I realized that even though the original scope was fundamentally complete, the potential for what this application could be and do is just in the early stages and far from being complete.   ', ""We are currently planning to:1) Better understanding of manufacturing requirements - I came up with the idea for this application after speaking with the operations director for lean manufacturer that does contract work. Before moving forward I want to better understand the needs of a variety of manufacturers in order to make this application significantly more meaningful as part of the digital transformation underway.2) Enhance existing functionality and capability - The current scope of this application is a bit limited.  After I better understand the manufacturing requirements above, I plan to vet potential enhancement ideas with various manufacturers to determine what functionality and capabilities would provide the best value to them. Additionally, we plan to address API endpoint integration performance which were not implemented due to the short timeframe of the project.3) Identify best platform for ease of use - Currently our application runs on PC, Mac and Linux standalones. Since we are using Unity we know we can build this application on selected browsers; Android and iOS devices; and in VR and AR. Again, before moving forward I'd like to better understand from manufacturers what makes the most sense for them.4) Incorporate analytical tools - Running a simulation requires data from the WiP and EA APIs in addition to the locational and animation data used to build the 3D scene.  Having this data available lends itself to incorporating analytical tools to optimize the operations which might include machine learning, linear programming, neural networks or other relevant tools.

"SprachBox","Skill to access the voice mail system of Deutsche Telekom (Germany landline).","[6491, 'In Germany Telekom Deutschland GmbH is the leading telecommunication operator and is transforming its land line telephone access to all IP (already 50% of its 20.2 Million Customers are migrated), which also migrates the classic voice mail system to a cloud based one. Years ago, I was one of the first migrated customers. There was no dedicated iPhone app, so I made one which reads the voicemail system, stores the messages on the phone and can play them. The login is stored in the app. So when I got the Echo and there was no skill it was natural to port my app as a skill to my echo. ', 'The skill first needs an account link (login data for the ip voice mail system). Then it can query the number of messages (status), give information about a single specific message and can even play the recorded voice. ', 'I made a php script which is connected to a mysql database. The account linking script checks the login data against the voicemail system and if everything is ok, stores the login in data inside the database. The login is encrypted by the generated authentication token and two hashes (with different salt) are used as search id. The skill script gets the authentication token from Alexa, generates the search id to look up the login data from the database and uses the authentication token to decrypt the login credentials. Then it can query the voicemail system. The voicemessage is provided by a third script as MP3 to the audio player. This script shares the server session with the skill script. The skill script codes the session parameter to the url, which is provided to the audio player. So the MP3 PHP script gets the access token and id of the message to play from the server session. ', 'There is no public oAuth2 Service or anything like this for the VoiceMail System, so I build this as an intermediate.There is no URL of the VoiceMail System to stream the voice record as MP3, so I have to build it as well. This works on the fly (no voice record is stored at my intermediate server), to strengthen privacy. German language is more diverse than English. So Alexa does not get all tweeks, when it comes to ordinal numbers by gender (see what I learned). ', ""High security standard, for the login and voicemail data. Database content is useless whiteout the access token which is stored at amazon. So an attacker needs access to different servers (Script on Webserver, DB Server and Amazon) which is unlikely.Incorporate two special skill features (account linking and audio player) and managed that complexity.Build the skill with PHP, while this is not supported by an official SDK.The skill is live in Germany since end of march and has over 200 active users six weeks later.Telekom Deutschland GmbH is release partner of echo in Germany. It sell Echo at its retail store and offers a smart home skill for their smart home solution - but not for their voice message system, yet. This skill is not built on behalf of TD nor supported by TD - it's just made on my own. "", 'A lot about the tweeks of voice recognition. In german there three kinds of nouns (male, female and neutral) and ordinal numbers like first and second changes for them. Input: Alexa only recognizes the male form, but message is female. So second message is not ""zweiter Nachricht"" it is ""zweite Nachricht"". But if Alexa is asked to match ""zweite"" to a number, it tries to match it to a male form, which results in twelve. Here I made an own type for female ordinal numbers. This enables me to add nick names like ""letzte"" (last), ""vor letzte"" (second last), ""neuste"" (newest) to those numbers, so that the user has more variances in calling the skill. Output: I could not just put ""... 2. ..."" into the response, I created an array with the correct word for an amount of numbers. While creating the response, I invoke a function with the number. If the number is inside the range of the array elements, it uses the number as index and responses the word. If the number exceeds the array, it responses the number with a dot.

"Kinetica","Kinetica is an IoT device that creates a cost effective channel of communication for motor neurone disease patients.","[6611, ""2 months ago, my dad's former boss - Mr.Mittal -  came to Bangkok, Thailand for medical treatment. I soon found out that he suffered from motor neurone disease - a mild case of ALS specifically. I was awestruck by his condition. Just 20 years ago he ran large textile factories in Nairobi, Kenya alongside Indian businessmen. One morning, he and his wife came over to our house for breakfast. I witnessed the amount of assistance he required from his wife in order to perform basic tasks such as getting up, eating, drinking water, and even using the restroom. A few hours later, his wife decided to go to the market with my mother, leaving me alone with Mr.Mittal. Though he was able to partially move his hands and speak, most of the words came out to be gibberish. He was asking for something but I couldn't understand him. I wasn't able to ask his wife either because she would also have to guess and check what he wanted through the cell phone. After a few minutes of guessing, I finally brought him what he desired - a mere glass of water. Despite his medical condition, I was the one that felt disabled. I felt incompetent and powerless. At that moment, I realized that this was a problem worth tackling. Bridging the gap between ALS patients and their care takers was a paramount issue. I soon contacted my tech buddy - Mantej, who is extremely interested in studying biology and robotics - and decided to fix this problem!  "", 'The device is really quite simple. An ALS patient rests the arduino board on their hand. Whenever they touch a certain part of the device, the accelerometer is activated. They then move their hands in specified directions depending on what they need. As an example, if they move their hand a little to the right, our program translates that to wanting water. This data is then uploaded online for the caretaker of the patient to see (so they know exactly what their patient needs). The device uses a photoresistor to activate the accelerometer. Once the accelerometer is activated, it records the (x,y,z) coordinates. It then waits for an additional 6 seconds and remeasures the (x,y,z) coordinates. It calculates the delta difference between the respective coordinates (x2-x1, y2-y1, z2-z1) and checks for differences. All this data is sent to python scripts that analyze the motion. The delta values are then conditionally matched to some pre-defined gestures. From there, the gestures are printed online to a website. This allows both the person at the location to know exactly what the patient needs and for one that is in a remote place (ex. the wife of Mr.Mittal who was at the market). ', ""The device consists of 2 parts - hardware and software. For the hardware, we wired up an Arduino 101 with a basic breadboard, which consisted of a photo resistor, a 10k ohm resistor, and an accelerometer (adxl345). Whenever the patient would cover the photo resistor its voltage would change and send the data to the serial monitor. Whenever a change in the voltage was detected (below 850 in the case of the photo resistor), the accelerometer within the arduino was triggered. For the software side, the arduino would run a simple .ino file and receive the (x,y,z) coordinates. It would then wait for 6 seconds and then remeasure the (x,y,z) coordinates. This data was all sent to the serial monitor. From here, a python script using the serial library would use a baud rate of 9600 to connect to the serial monitor. It would save the data points in an array (of size 7, because 2 sets of (x,y,z) coordinates) and transfer this data into a .txt file (called 'output.txt' in this case). From here, it would also automatically run another python script that would analyze the delta change in the coordinates (see above) and based upon the changes form the closest gesture/desire. This gesture/desire would then be printed onto another .txt file (called 'input.txt' in this case). From here, PHP code was called that would transfer the .txt data to static web page. This was then modified a little bit using HTML5. The patient's desire was then printed to this web page and would be available for a person to view from anywhere (our's is limited to localhost for the demo).  "", 'Some of the challenges we ran into included: patient research, gesture movement accuracy, and connecting scripts. Motor neurone disease is a rare disease and has multiple different forms (ALS being one of them). Each patient can suffer varying degrees of this disease and would thus be able to use their hands in varying amounts. We had to set a standard amount they would be able to move their hand muscles. We also had to understand how to translate simple hand movements into desires/needs of the patients. We boiled them down to the bare basics to keep it simple: food, water, and restroom. Different movements would belong in one of the categories (we certainly plan on adding more when we receive more data). Perhaps one of the hardest challenges we ran into was connecting Arduino, Python, and PHP scripts into a single project. We had to figure out how to efficiently use libraries to create a single unified product.  ', ""We are extremely proud to have created an extremely cheap method of communication for the patients! The fact that we even made a small group of people's lives easier makes us overjoyed. Though our technology is not complex, it most certainly proves how each one of us can help those in need. "", 'We learned how to transfer data from a microprocessor, like the Arduino, to the web and allow people around the world to have access to the data. We also learned how to convert gestures into meaningful and accurate data. Most importantly, we learned how easy it can be to make a difference in the world! ', 'If we do win any cash prize, we plan on using it to make the device more compact, performing more market research, and using machine learning to analyze gestures.

"ECONDITIONER","We want to save water in California and built a smart air conditioning system that produces water.","[6740, 'Check out our Prezi hereWe used the Artik 10 Kit for this project.A lot of us have looked at various ways to save and conserve water. We, Team WPI decided to look at an option we believe is not fully utilized and is a source of water on a daily basis. The source, Air Conditioning. Each air conditioner has a runaway water pipe attached to it. This pipe essentially drains water formed by the condensation process inside the AC. Team WPI has come up with a way to harvest this water.We decided to focus on how each individual can contribute to this mission. This is because a 1.5 AC generates 0.3 gallons per hour while a 5 Ton Central AC generates 1 gallon per hour. Considering an average run time of 9 hours per day, a window AC generates 2.7 gallons each day while a Central AC generates 9 gallons a day!This trend has resulted in almost 87% homes with some sort of Air Conditioning equipment.  AC has virtually become a standard equipment of every household. Among 50 states in USA, California alone accounts for a massive 7.3% of air conditioning. A figure which is 5 times for than most states. This is because of the climate in California. California belongs to the region with hot/mixed dry climate type. With an average summer temperature of 90F and a year round temperature of around 80F, the high use of AC in California is justified.Let’s take a look at how this is a viable solution across the world. In 2013, a rough estimate of AC sales are approx. 900 million. A high volume of which are central ACs and rooftops AC. Together if we can implement E-Conditioner, we can save a lot of water and this in-turn will result more water available from traditional sources like dams and supply. ', 'We built and smart AC system that also saves water, as you can see in the video we can save up to 9 gallons of water a day. Even more if we optimize our condensation process. We use ARTIK10 to connect an standard air conditioning system with our own secure servers (try it on econtioner.me) via an MQTT protocol, we process information as temperature, humidity and most important the amount of water we save and its purity. We also add extra features to your standar AC system, you can program patters into the Econditioner, so that you also save energy. It learns from your ussage and can send you alerts if you are out of your house and left it on.A global solution ', 'We use ARTIK10 as the main processor in our Artik System, we integrated it to the air conditioning control board (got as much info as we could, but this is an ongoing process) to capture some data like temperature, we also incorporated sensors of our own. We then push this data to our server, that has a webpage on http://econditioner.me/ , using the MQTT protocol that is pretty common for IoT applications we get and receive data from our secure server. We can get useful information as temperature, humidity, water saved and the purity of the water and can send from our server to our Econditioner information about turn on and off signals and many features we are currently implementing (You AC unit would be able to turn itself on 30 minutes before you arrive home to greet you with a nice weather). ', ""There were many challenges we ran into, finding an air conditioning system that meets the needs for this project was one of them, we looked around standard AC units but some of them didn't fit our needs, we kind of used and old one at the end, but are looking to implement the Econditioner with a custom one, so that we can have an smart AC from start.It was also hard to use our own servers, planning databases, mqtt brokers and others was a challenge that we overcame at last, and of course keep improving the platform so that we can make Econditioner the new smart AC in your house.At last the final challenge was to save as much water as possible. We keep on working on improving the condensation progress of Econditioner so that we can save more water, trying to optimize this task to a limit is hard, but we are up for the challenge. "", 'We made one of the very first smart AC units. A user can manipulate and get feedback from his/her AC system from a computer, a tablet of a phone, you can turn it on and off wherever you are and also help solve the water crisis.We build a prototype platform for it, and a prototype product.The amount of water we can save is considerable looking at our numbers. ', ""From Cad Design, rendering, mqtt, to the more chemical part of this process, things like how water purification works, water condensation, optimized processes to obtain water from humidity. We also learn A LOT about California's use in air conditioning, we went to tons of data to make sure this project is feasible.  "", 'There are many more things to do, we want to optimize the water saving process to a maximum, having the best performance possible with minimal energy consumption. We would like to collect water from the fog too. Fog in an important resource of water that is found on the air, using it with Econditioner would be a feature that would make it even more attractive to the public.Optimize the platform and in the future launch a mobile app (It is currently a web app). Also add more features as intelligent control (the one we are currently working on)The sky is the limit, we look forward to keep on working hard to improve Econditioner.

"Stranded in the Expanse","Stranded in the Expanse is a sci-fi game that encourages fitness. You earn energy credits in the game by exercising!","[6930, ""I have always loved the sci-fi genre and games. One other thing I enjoy is running and going for long walks out in nature. Recently, my wife and I both got Fitbit trackers to help encourage our walking and fitness routine. We found using them to compete for the 'highest' number of steps each day to be quite addictive and fun.When I stumbled upon this hackathon, I was researching Docker containers and Kubernetes for work related purposes. I thought to myself: why not combine the already addictive Fitbit experience of competing for steps and walking, with a fun sci-fi adventure game, and use an online service running on Openshift to enable Fitbit to talk to the game on player's devices?This would provide people with a mobile game that is not only fun to play, but also motivational in terms of exercise and fitness.In addition to that, I could make the game experience even more fun/competitive by adding online leaderboards to the platform running on top of Openshift.Thus, Stranded in the Expanse was born! "", ""Stranded in the Expanse is sci-fi, action adventure experience that gamifies fitness. You use your Fitbit tracker device to help you progress in the game. The game encourages health and physical activity by giving the player in-game credit that they can use to upgrade their player's ship, in reward for steps counted on their Fitbit tracker. The online platform that makes this all possible runs on top of OpenShift's online platform.Players download the app from Google Play, install it, run it, and hit the register button to register a free account.They then do a 'once-off' hook up of their Fitbit account, to their Stranded in the Expanse account and perform an update of their Fitbit stats at least once a day.They login to the game using their registered details whenever they wish to play, and the game automatically converts any steps they have completed on Fitbit into 'energy credits' in the game, which they can use to upgrade their player's ship, and improve it.The aim of the game is to re-fuel your stranded ship by harvesting energy crystals in space. Once the player has harvested the required amount, they are able to play the end-game sequence and return home.Whenever the player wants more / better upgrades for their ship, the incentive is there for them to go out and walk/run with their Fitbit device! "", ""I started off using the MongoDB/Node.js template on Openshift. I spent quite a long time messing around with this and learning about how it worked, and how the network link between the containers was created. I also learned how the Openshift online platform worked, and how webhooks worked.Once I had all of this figured out, I deleted my sample / test project, and started fresh.I developed a very basic game menu and simple game prototype that just had a flying ship in Unity3D and got that up and running.Next, I developed a base node.js solution that was able to read from and insert values into my mongoDB instance. This part took quite a bit of skilling up, and I spent a significant amount of time learning about node.js and mongoDB here.Never-the-less, I found myself making good progress and just kept iterating on the game client and the online platform, adding an API manager to the game that was able to talk to my Node.js API. I built-in a way for the platform to register and login users, and authenticate them when API calls were made from the game. I plumbed in methods for the platform to talk to the Fitbit API and store any synchronized fitbit data for the player's on their accounts. I then built a way for the platform to communicate this to the game client.Once the core mechanic was in place, I began resolving all the game's logic. This includes things such as: player control and input, enemy spawning patterns / behaviors, attacks, player weapons, as well as the movement of random space objects and mining mechanics to collect space crystal with the mining laser.From there I added live leaderboards (total fitbit steps) for players to compete on and a way for the game platform's API to work with these, and added a message of the day service too. The leaderboards can be viewed online on the site, as well as through the game client. "", ""MongoDB and Node.js! I needed to learn a fair bit here. I now know what Node.js developers mean when they talk about 'callback hell'.I also ran into some challenges getting my game client to operate smoothly when making web requests to my node.js web API. I needed to figure out how to get these calls onto background threads, which is traditionally quite difficult to achieve with the Unity3D engine. I did manage this in the end though, and web requests now play out smoothly on background worker threads and don't lock up the UI. "", ""Completing a full solution from the back-end server in Node.js, and mongoDB database, to a custom middleware game API in Node.js to a full featured, fun client-side game on user's device. I'm really proud I managed to complete this full solution considering I've only had late nights and weekends to work on it around my full-time job and commitments as husband and father.Having a game released into the wild that is free, and that encourages fitness. "", ""I learned a lot about Openshift's platform, and the benefits it brings to the table. In terms of both easing workflows, and not having to manage Dockerfiles and complicated container networking.I also learned a lot about Node.js and MongoDB. "", 'I would definitely like to take this further. I think it is very unique (gaming and fitness!) and has great potential to go further.I would like to integrate with other fitness trackers next - like the Jawbone for example.After that I would like to spend more time on the gameplay and storyline of the gameplay.Then, I would like to add more online platform related features like daily challenges for extra rewards etc...

We then used the context provided by the CloudSight API, and used the Nutritionix API to grab information about the food's nutrition data. The architecture of the app is very simple. The user takes a picture of some food with the iPhone app, which then sends a POST request to our Node.js backend (running on a Microsoft Azure VM). The Node.js backend then handles all of the communication with the various image recognition APIs and nutrition APIs.

"", ""We originally started by trying to write our own classifier using OpenCV. As we mentioned earlier, we realized very early on that building and training an image classifier that would identify various foods would be too difficult, time consuming, and computational expensive, as there was simply too large of a training data set to be processed and evaluated. As a result, we decided that using the CloudSight API would make our lives much simpler. We used the CloudSight API's Visual Search APIs to get context about food-related images and then later grab nutritional data. In addition, we also ran into latency issues with the CloudSight API, as the image recognition was a long, expensive process. We realized that part of the reason why the process was taking so long was because the images that were being sent by the iPhone app were very high-resolution, and also very large. We learned that bringing the resolution down brought the size of the image down significantly, and as a result we were able to get the CloudSight classifier to speed up a slight amount. The latency issues became less of a problem when we decided to change the intent of the classifier, being that the classifier would look for the main object within the image (in this case, the food), and not try and analyze all details of the entire image (e.g. the classifier would recognize additional, unnecessary, features such as the color of the table or plate that the food was sitting on).Accomplishments that we are proud ofWe are most proud of the fact of how well-designed and efficient the app is, as well as the fact that Kenko is now able to identify almost all foods, as well as retrieve the relevant nutritional data with a fairly small margin of error.What we learnedWe learned many things throughout the hackathon, but the big lesson of the day was that image classification requires a lot of computational power in order to train accurate identifiers (especially when it comes to training against a data set as large as the amount of food on Earth).

"faceStylr"," Polyvore meets Augmented Reality for styling your face. Make meaningful product connections with your customers!","[8270, 'My mother was a former beauty queen, from another country, who had become completely forsaken to beauty. Though she was once even an Avon lady, she would not teach me anything about makeup. Once, when we were watching a late night beauty pageant, and I looked wistfully at the contestants, my mother told me, “No, you’ll never qualify.” I was not raised in a competitive family, but I had always personally believed in winning contests and at age 12, being told I had no chance meant this wasn’t worth the time investment at all. I learned early on, from my mother, the beauty expert, that I was not pretty.  18 years later, in the streets of NYC and Paris, on my own, I would discover the world of expert fashion stylists, who are able to make anyone look glamorous — they can even make an ugly girl look pretty. For anyone in this modern world, seeing yourself look amazing is transformative. It fosters hope and makes you believe in your dreams again.

I’ve identified and executed on building an AR use-case to help brands sell products to millennials and beyond, and helps people feel better about the way they look.

(Sorry for the lag and everything for this POC!)A Note Exclusively for my “Bad Fans”: Clarification on Past WorkFaceStylr is a project I started designing, architecting and building on July 27, 2018 after a week of feeling like an outsider among women in tech at Google Cloud Next (even being rejected from the Women in Tech Social). I’ve designed my own frameworks to build AR apps… fast—and I’ve also used a bunch of other modern programming frameworks. These are a bunch of RealityScript libraries I wrote on top of Unity C#. I built SnapGlass.es Share two years ago, but that was just a simple glasses try-on platform, with a 3x3 look comparison grid inspired by Warby Parker. That was also using OpenCV/Dlib from 2016. Tracking does not make all AR apps the same. Comparing that to this would be like comparing a basic dynamic website to an extensive blogging platform. The amount of work and the insight in software architecture to build the latter from the first is a world of difference. I built FaceShop.io last year before Facebook launched their AR Studio. Despite the similarity in name, for those who understand product, it is clear that my previous project FaceShop.io is very different from FaceStylr. Just in case, I’ll clarify the differences here: FaceShop is more of a “Photoshop for AR” - a general purpose creator software, similar to Facebook AR Studio or Snap Lens, but without relying on either platform. (It also includes a basic Flash ActionScript 1.0-inspired scripting language and a whole lot of things that would only be relevant for a professional creator tool.) FaceStylr is more like a “Polyvore for AR” - primarily a creative platform to discover fashion-related products and share product collections in a personal way that involves AR try-on’s. (Polyvore and Photoshop, though they both start with P, are very different - I hope we agree here!) FaceShop used the old OpenCV Dlib from last year with no stabilization. (And also allows the user to swap other face tracking SDKs, as it is tracking agnostic as a creator platform). ShopFace uses the latest OpenCV v3.4.1 and Dlib v19.7 and may switch to a commercial face tracking platform. Currently, a hackish stabilization with high-pass filters and optical flow is used.ShopFace has a variety of ecommerce and product and even referral link integrations. FaceShop was made directly for iOS on an iPad resolution device; for instant test-ability, FaceStylr was made initially for (desktop) WebGL.Simply summarized, FaceStylr is about creating AR Shopping experiences across the entire ecosystem, with benefits for both consumer and merchants to engage meaningful sales - and not just about creating arbitrary AR filters like FaceShop.

Rimworld is a perfect fit, but I think we can do more. ', 'Our extension in its first release will attempt to achieve the above story, however in a native and automated flow. Moderators (and the Broadcaster) can create a poll, with options selected from a defined list of in-game events. Viewers then vote on their preferred outcome, and the game automatically triggers the winning event. This all occurs within the Twitch ecosystem via our video overlay extension, giving the viewer, moderator and broadcaster a unified experience; Never needing to leave Twitch.

Our back-end is a Node.js server hosted on a BaaS for simple scaling and links the game to the extension. Finally and maybe the most important component is the game mod, in our case hosted on Steam Workshop, which queries our back-end for any commands and executes them within the game. ', 'I am familiar with JS, Node, and Mongo databases, I have however never made a mod for a game. Rimworld uses C# and I have very limited experience with it. After the initial struggle of debating architecture and designing our authentication flow (How do you link the game itself to a server when it has no idea about the Twitch streamer?), our next challenge was learning how to actually trigger the events in the game.Luckily we have a well rounded team, and one of our developers (InfinitySamurai) was able to carry the bulk of the weight when it came to C#.

Then we wanted to devise a solution that would bring the proven process improvement methodologies to healthcare delivery.But it's easier said than done.  Currently, BPM (and its existing tools) makes a lot of sense when applied to a relatively fixed activities to produce relatively fixed business values (e.g. a widget).  But healthcare delivery is anything but fixed - patients and providers are unique, care pathways and care processes are not standardized within and across HCOs, and care outcomes are certainly not widgets. "", 'Our solution enables an HCO targeting a specific care process (e.g. ""Discharge planning to post-hospital follow up"") to quickly put together, by drag-and-drop, a Care Flow Map consisting of listener/action nodes.  This Care Flow Map guides both the patient and his/her care team members through the care process with end-user functions, including reminders, alerts, messaging, tracking, automated inputs, device connectivity, and document management, to achieve necessary care coordination and integration with IT systems such as EMRs.As it coordinates for multiple patients through their care pathways, it measures and analyzes various process metrics into process intelligence, which may be used to improve or even re-engineer the care process.  It includes process improvement tools such as A/B Testing to help achieve the optimization goals. ', 'We assembled a core team with healthcare IT, EMR, enterprise computing, clinical process, UI/UX, and full-stack software development experiences.We researched for the disconnects between current BPM and care processes.We hypothesized the shape and form of solution that HCOs would adopt.We looked at systems that have similarities to the solution we were envisioning.We spoke with more than 40 people in the healthcare industry, including front-line clinicians, Medical Directors, CMOs, CMIOs, healthcare IT senior managers and workers.We synthesized and prioritized from our experiences and learning a set of user stories / requirements.We designed and built our current demonstration system.

That drove us to closing the gap with integrating day-to-day end-user functions with the Care Flow Map so the solution will provide immediate, tangible values to the current care coordination environments.

"The Endless Weather","What can you learn from your local climate? Where else and when else in the US is very similar to your favorite day?","[7945, ""How many travelers seek destinations with similar weather to their favorite vacation spot? Are you a golfer looking to vary the annual trip to Myrtle Beach, but maintain the same temperature? Are you deciding on family vacation spots, and would love a list of destinations most similar in weather to Cape Cod?Embedded in our fondest memories is the weather of that particular day - a beautiful day at the beach, a perfect day on the slopes, or a sunny day on the greens. What if you could find that weather again somewhere, sometime, could you find that memory as well?In 1966 the famous surf filmmaker Bruce Brown traveled the world in search of an Endless Summer. Spending a year locked in their favorite weather sure turned out to be a great decision. In the spirit of The Endless Summer, I set out to find my own Endless Weather with any conditions I wished, and determine where that would take me- be it Utah, Vermont, or even Wine Country.High quality local climate data is kept in many locations nationwide, but is often just used to help pitch today's forecast or contribute to the global climate picture. What other stories can this data tell? Here, we find out.The IBM Bluemix cloud allowed us to take temperature and precipitation data and turn it into information rich maps and virtual itineraries telling us where and when to be. "", 'Monthly temperature normals (average daily minimum, average daily, average daily maximum) and precipitation normals (25th percentile, median, 75th percentile) are imported into the Apache Spark environment.The data is first formatted through a series of map-reduce steps to create a vector representing the climate normals at each of the 1164 locations for 12 months, a total of 13,968 locations in space and time.These vectors are then compared to every other vector in space and time by computing the euclidian distance, a similarity metric, between the pairs.The resulting similarity values are then organized through another round of map-reduce steps to arrive at 13,968 arrays , each with 13,968 values comparing this time and place with all others (total 195,105,024 values).The results, both graphic and numeric, are presented through a mobile web application allowing the user to quickly and easily position the interactive map to the location of their choice (sorry, only continental United States this iteration!), select the month which they would like to compare against, and have the images shown, as well as explore several tables of data illustrating just where the most similar locations and times are. ', 'Apache Spark provides a Python binding, PySpark, which is ideal for scientific data analysis, given Python\'s strengths in data analysis, statistics, and scientific data libraries.Data from the US National Centers for Environmental Information\'s (NCEI) 1981–2010 Climate Normals were imported to the provided Object Storage. Spark Resilient Distributed Dataset\'s (RDD\'s) are created from these files and joined, then organized through a series of map-reduce operations, resulting in an RDD containing key-value pairs of location/month key and climate normal values.PySpark\'s cartesian operator comes in handy to create a new RDD that is a cartesian product of the original RDD with itself, with all possible pairs (195,105,024 pairs) of keys now represented and ready to be distributed.A method was created using the numpy library to compute the Euclidean distance between each vector pair and mapped to each pair in the RDD. Apache Spark held true to it\'s reputation with over 195 million vector operations taking well less than 1 hour.The RDD containing the distance between each pair of vectors, or similarity between the two, was then organized through a series of map-reduce operations, with the final RDD containing key-value pairs of location/month key and an array of 13,968 similarity values.Using the geographic coordinates of each location, maps representing each calendar month of the year were created. A green/yellow/red color-scale was used with green indicating very similar (go!) conditions and red indicating very different (don\'t go!) conditions. Total images created are 12 images per location per month, a total of 167,616 images. Each image answers a question such as ""How does the month of August across the US compare to my selected location in February?"" ', 'Demo account scalabilityHigh quality climate data is available for nearly 10,000 locations and available on a daily basis. The original idea was to compare all locations, all 366 days of the year (includes leap day). It was quickly determined that the demo account provided for the Sparkathon could not reasonably handle the nearly 91 trillion combinations that result from daily data at the full location list. The locations were trimmed down to only locations in the U.S. Historical Climatology Network (HCN) and monthly data were used to bring the scale of the demo into line with the provided infrastructure. I have no doubt the methods scale well with increased resources and such a large problem is still well suited for the Apache Spark framework.Limited Object StorageWith the intent of creating over 167,000 images, periodic transfer to an external system was required to keep the storage usage below the limit. ', 'Climate science is robust, but the presentation of climate data has been somewhat lacking. Such large datasets in time and space, combined with often complex statistical analysis of the data, can lead to a lessened interest in how to fully utilize the information. I believe this application, of comparing locations, provides a fun, inquisitive and information rich environment to both learn and plan based on local climate data.This model can continue to be refined to bring more data and targeted information to all. ', ""Certainly Apache Spark (PySpark to be specific). As a long time data scientist, numerical methods using numpy are familiar to me, but being able to distribute the processes via an RDD was a real joy and impressive at times. My development cycle was helped by seeing results (and mistakes) quicker than I would have otherwise. Seeing the power and scalability of Apache Spark was a great value in the Sparkathon and Spark will remain a tool I'll use for future projects. "", 'Daily data at all locationsI would love to extend the analysis to all locations and daily data using a much larger Spark infrastructure. Additional data such as wind and snow are available at daily frequencies and could really increase the value of the analysis.Global DatasetsWhere possible global datasets should be incorporated to not only compare the continental US, but all locations worldwide. By creating a comparison of all locations, any user could happen upon any set of weather conditions they can dream of.Incorporate travel costsTravel costs (hotel and airfare) could be incorporated into the results, showing the user not only where and when the conditions are very similar, but also where costs can be minimized for that particular experience.UI developmentWith Big Data being the focus of the Sparkathon, much of the time was used for data analysis. Revisiting the UI development to include native mobile applications and refined layouts could enhance the utilization of the output.

"reVIVE","A more efficient ADHD diagnostic and treatment mechanism using VR","[3704, 'We have a few friends who are afflicted with ADHD and we have witnessed firsthand how debilitating and inconvenient the disorder can be. ADHD diagnosis is very complicated and time-consuming -- it can take up to 6-9 months and thousands of dollars. In addition, ADHD diagnosis is based on a variety of subjective factors and there is no definitive, quantifiable way to diagnose it. To add, treatment of the disorder can be a hassle as well, as it often involves usage of a suite of stimulants such as Adderall, all of which come equipped with side effects (such as appetite loss and depressive feelings). We wanted to create a VR solution to this problem that can provide both a diagnostic and treatment mechanism for ADHD.  ', 'The VR world we created presents three exercises that test different diagnostic criteria for ADHD: Restlessness: Three concentric cylinders surround the user and confine him/her in a very tight space. User will be bombarded with distractions outside the cylinders (such as flashing lights & moving objects), but is instructed to stay still in the exact same position (without moving outside the cylinders).Ability to concentrate while performing a task that involves sustained mental effort: User has to connect the dots and solve a maze without touching the sides of the maze.Reaction time: The user has to respond to flashing dots appear and disappear on the screen.

Producing and working with user stories of appropriate quality is critical for development teams. There is a need for common understanding of the quality of their stories. "", 'The Story Quality Add-On for JIRA checks and shows the quality of user stories.Its purpose is to help development teams identify and improve low quality and not-yet-ready stories,and possibly avoid starting progress on them.The add-on consists of a custom field and a workflow validator.Custom fieldThe Story Quality calculated field displays a rating of the overall quality of user stories. The field is sortable and searchable, and the rating is an integer value between 0% and 100%, based on different criteria consisting of the INVEST principles and other indicators. The overall rating is a weighed average of these indicators.A greater value indicates a more concise, complete, precise, and clear user story. The general idea is that the closer this value is to 100%, the more likely it is that the story is ready to start progress on, resulting in a more efficient process.In short, this rating gives team members an understanding of the quality and readiness of their stories.Workflow validatorThe Story Quality validator blocks all ""In Progress"" or ""Start Progress"" transitions for non-administrator users (by default) for user stories that have insufficient quality rating, that is, points less than the minimum specified for the project. This helps ensure that the team is working only on stories that are ready for development.IndicatorsThe indicators are rating the quality of a story (a JIRA issue of type ""Story"") based on different criteria. These criteria are designed from a developers\' point of view, because their work is impacted first hand by the quality of the stories.An indicator is calculating a point between 0% and 100% (inclusive), where 0% means the lowest, and 100% means the highest quality. The calculation can be any mathematical formula, but most indicator implementations are starting with maximum points (100%) and then giving penalty points for problems they find.See detailed description of indicator calculations in the readme.

The company TSOLife was incorporated in Sept 2014, but the concept was inspired decades before. It was inspired by loving grandparents, who helped raise a grandson from birth.My grandfather was a remarkable man, he had the opportunity to be an Olympic athlete, he was the recipient of the civic recognition award and he was inducted into his high schools hall of fame. His life is not only worth celebrating, it is worth remembering. The stories of his accomplishments could currently soon be lost. Verbal history dies after only 2 generations. There is no Wikipedia page dedicated to his life, no published biography documenting his many achievements; there is strictly what we remember.As it currently stands, history is only recorded for the famous or infamous, the rest are left to be forgotten. TSOLife was created with the conviction that we are all worth remembering–that life should be celebrated, passed down and remembered. We all deserve to leave behind a personalized legacy. History isn’t just for the famous or infamous but for all of us to leave something behind.While I have always felt strongly about this vision, it finally hit me when my grandmother passed in 2014 around thanksgiving. There is so much I never got to know about her, and even more I will forget. The only lasting legacy she left behind was her funeral service page. The notion that all that my grandkids will ever be able to learn about her is her name, date of birth, and occupation, haunts me.That notion ignited a fire: from that moment on I dedicated my life to creating a web platform that will truly allow our story to transcend time. I created TSOLife, and it will soon be launched nationwide in August. It is my greatest accomplishment thus far in life, and also my greatest regret because I didn’t make it soon enough for my grandparents. Their story is in my hands to tell, and I will do my best… though I know so much history has already been lost. ', 'TSOLife is an online platform where users can craft the story of their lives. For a one-time fee, a user\'s personal history is hosted and maintained forever through a perpetual funding model leveraging cloud storage. On TSOLife\'s beautifully simple and integrated platform, stories, videos, photos, and memories can be preserved for future generations, allowing the user to leave behind a personal legacy. The stories can be categorized, and will also be placed on a timeline of events and on an interactive global map. Users also have the feature option of creating their own family tree and personal network linking with past and future members of their family.A feature that fully captures our vision and embodies our idea of connecting to the future and past is the ""wish I were there"" feature. This unique function allows members to write a specialized message, record a video, and/or upload an audio file that can be delivered on a specific date or event in the future. For example, a personal message can be sent to a great grandchild, on his or her high school graduation day, or to a child on their 50th anniversary. TSOLife ensures the preservation of family memories and emotional connections and ties the past, present, and future together in a beautiful ever-changing story.Challenges we ran intoA primary challenge we ran into, was that we wanted a way to ensure our users that the information would be hosted forever and find a way to make that financially sustainable. We were able to develop a onetime fee pricing model that allowed us to calculate the cost of host information forever and by determining the net present value of the information stored and charging based on that number. We believe that once history is online it should be free to view for future generations and friends.Accomplishments that we\'re proud ofMajor Accomplishments and Awards:•2015: Carins Foundation Innovation Challenge winner•2015: Score Biz Fest winner•2015: Met Kickstarter funding goal•2015: Florida Venture Form finalisthttp://www.cultofmac.com/400088/tsolife-is-a-place-where-your-story-can-live-long-after-you-do/#more-400088http://www.news-journalonline.com/article/20150905/NEWS/150909709http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/technology/tech_check/os-stetson-story-telling-app-launch-20151019-post.htmlWhat we learnedWe learned that nursing home residents in the United States have the highest concentration of depression.

"HappyHour","Don't lose track of the night.","[2657, ""For students away at universities, it has become more important than ever to know how to take care of oneself. As college students, we are exposed to a variety of things, including alcohol. Even though we've all had educational classes or seminars in school about drinking safely, sometimes a gentle reminder can make a huge difference. That's where we came up with the idea of HappyHour, a pebble app that can keep you safe.  "", ""HappyHour initially asks users for a couple of inputs: height, weight, and gender. These parameters will be used to calculate the blood-alcohol-content (BAC). BAC is a universal measurement of the alcohol in an individual's system. It is a complex equation that our application simplified for each individual personally. From then onwards, users can specify a '+' or a '-' button, allowing them to keep track of how many drinks they've had with a click of a button. The BAC accordingly updates and creates a vibration, reminding them about their drinks. When the BAC is above 0.08 (the legal threshold for drunk driving), HappyHour creates a longer vibration, indicating that the user should take an Uber home. A click on the select button will trigger an http request that the pebble sends to our node.js server, where we use Uber and Twilio API to text the user information on the nearest Uber, time required to take them home, and estimated price. Challenges We ran intoDeveloping on Pebble Time was a learning curve at some points, especially when we were having trouble uploading color resources and performing GET http requests to send longitude and latitude data. Accomplishments that We are proud ofWe are definitely proud of parsing through the Uber JSON API data, as well as setting up Pebble Time to perform GET XMLHttp requests and extract information from that to obtain the geographic coordinates of the Pebble. The entire process of getting user-selected data and displaying the BAC in real time was also difficult, but we've learned a lot in the process!What's next for HappyHourWe hope to clean up the user interface code a bit (it's difficult to have good coding habits at hackathons!).

"bSmart Smart Diabetes Management System","Manage Type 1 diabetes through IoT technologies","[6226, ""Two years ago my 4 year old daughter was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes and since then my main goal in life has been to manage her blood sugar (BG) levels within an acceptable range. Although there are quite a few technologies out there that are of great help in the management of Type 1 Diabetes, I believe there is a lot more we can do to make the lives of Type 1 Diabetics and their care givers easier. I work in data analytics in my day job and thought latest technologies like Internet-of-Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning/Deep Learning can be of great help in the management of Type 1 Diabetes. In the quest for better management of my daughter's BG numbers I decided to embark on this project to build a system that will capture all the information it can, in real-time, and analyze it and suggest treatment options in an easy to consume format i.e. text messages on phone. This system, in its fully developed form, could act like an AI brain which can suggest treatment plans in real-time to care givers/baby sitters.Type 1 Diabetes is an auto-immune disease in which the pancreas stops producing insulin which is an important hormone for converting food into energy. There are 1.5 Million Americans living with Type 1 diabetes and it costs more than $15 Billion each year to manage this disease. Diabetes is the most expensive chronic disease in America today. Improving the care for Type 1 diabetics is not only good for the patients themselves but also for the whole society in terms of lowering healthcare costs.Typically a Type 1 Diabetic's BG goes up when they eat food and their BG comes down when they inject insulin via an insulin pump or insulin shot. The BG could go too high if not enough insulin is taken and the BG could go dangerously low if too much insulin is taken. Currently healthcare providers suggest insulin dose based on a formula which takes into account the number of carbs in the food eaten. But a true calculation of the insulin dose should also take into account other factors such as the type of food and the activity level to name a few. Making sure the BG level stays within range is a daily battle and any assistance with this would be of great help. "", 'The system I developed tries to integrate data from two devices namely an insulin pump and a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) every 5 minutes and uses the insulin intake and BG data to predict what the BG levels will be in the next 2 hours. If the predicted BG is too high then an SMS text message is sent to the care giver suggesting an insulin dose and if the predicted BG is too low then a text message is sent suggesting low treatment to the care giver. No SMS message is sent if the predicted BG is within range. This system could be expanded to integrate other information like activity, heart rate and ambient temperature all of which have an impact on the BG levels. ', 'Data from the insulin pump and CGM is read using a third party android app which stores the data in a mongoDB. I wrote a python script to read the mongoDB every 2 mins and extract the data and send it to the Azure IoT Hub. An Azure function listens to the Azure IoT Event Hub and stores the data in an Azure SQL Database. Every 10 mins another Azure function reads all the data in the Azure SQL server and executes a stored procedure to create the BG forecast. If the predicted BG is too high or low the Azure function sends a message to a Azure Storage Queue which in turn triggers another Azure Function which sends a text message via Twilio service. Bulk of my time was spent in building the stored procedure which creates the BG Forecast which is currently rules based but could be expanded to leverage machine learning. ', ""Initially I wanted to develop the python script to run on a raspberry pi and connect to the insulin pump directly but realized it was too much of a technical challenge to deal with. Hence I resorted to using a third party app and also used my laptop instead of the raspberry pi to run the python script.The prediction engine needed to be tuned to my daughter's numbers to enable it to make sensible predictions. To make the system more universally usable we need to replace the current rules based engine to a Machine Learning driven algorithm.The text messages were initially schedule to run every 5 minutes which ended up annoying my wife who was one of the recipients of the messages, hence I had to reduce it to every 10 minutes. "", ""This is the first time I have been able to analyze my daughter's numbers in real-time and take corrective action based on the numbers. Lot of people rely on rules or gut feeling while managing their kids Type 1 Diabetes. I believe this system has the potential of making lives easy and protect kids with Type 1 diabetes from the harmful effects of sustained out-of-range BG levels. Since this system relies on text messaging to communicate the treatment plan it can help non-technical care givers. "", ""Predicting accurately is a herculean task. It requires a trial and error approach to get the algorithm right. Always err on the side of safety when predictions are related to healthcare. It's a fine balance between sending alerts when most needed and avoiding annoying the person we need to alert. Again trial and error approach helps to get the optimal level of alerting.  "", 'Create an app to read the data from insulin pump and fitness monitor and send it directly to Azure IoT hubChange the prediction engine to use Machine learning to make it more universally usable by people of all ages.Launch a Beta version for potential customers to start using it.

"EyePhone","Never lets an infected eye fly uncaught","[6464, 'Our eyes are the mirror to the outside world and are arguably the most important of the five senses. More than 20 million people suffer from blindness due to a disease known as cataract. These people are deprived of their sense of perception due to -- (a) untimely detection, (b) lack of quick solutions, and (c) lack of basic awareness. Cataract is the root cause for 5% of the United States population, and 60% of the African and South American population suffering with blindness. Although, cataract has often been termed as a disease striking the elderly population, but it has affected unto 40% of the children in developing nations. We believe any step that can safeguard the human vision is a vital step. EyePhone is one such smart step that tries to predict the existence of cataract in the human eye.  EyePhone empowers its user with a simple application that helps to detect the presence of cataract in their eyes at a cost of a single picture of their eye ! ', 'EyePhone aims at early detection of cataract so that quick remedial measures can be taken, in order to avoid unprecedented blindness. EyePhone also tries to provide quick solutions to its user, if they are detected in the cataract prone zone. EyePhone also tries to forewarn its users about the possibility of cataract if their results fall in the false positive set. All in all, EyePhone is a smart and sophisticated machine learning application (powered by android) the tries to use the best of both the worlds. This application can be downloaded and used, by any user, to check for the presence of cataract in their eye-lens, get educated about the causes and symptoms of cataract, and access quick remedial solutions. ', ""We designed EyePhone using a bottom-up approach with two separate modules, one targeting the Machine Learning and the other Android Application development. After performing unit testing of these individual components we did a system integration to launch an android application that detects cataract. Since the machine learning component required the data to be in a better quality, we used some image enhancement techniques to preprocess our data. We could not get any annotated data online, so we collected the data ourselves from Google Images. We took a dataset of 60 patients (30 cataract infected and 30 normal healthy people). We divided this dataset into 40, 10 and 10 patients for Training, Development and Testing purposes. The most important feature for this study was the whiteness of the small ring of the eye. In Cataract images, the inner surface of the cornea is more whitish as compared to that of normal images. We also took into account the Big Ring Area of the eye. In cataract images, the outer surface of the cornea images is bright in color as compared to that of the normal patients' image. Also, we took into account the Edge Pixel Count. Canny method is the most powerful edge detection method among them. It uses two different thresholds (to detect strong and weak edges), and it includes the weak edges in the output only if they are connected to strong edges. In the computation of EPC, we counted the number of white pixels in the output of the edge detection. Now, with all these features, we chose the Unsupervised K-means clustering algorithm as out baseline Machine Learning algorithm. The reason behind that was having access to only non-annotated data. The algorithm divides the datapoints into two sections (or clusters) which are separable. The test datapoint can be incorporated with the cluster to which its closer (Euclidean distance). From the Android side, we used Material Design concepts to bring together a clean and sleek UI that helps to minimize stress when dealing with diseases. We provide educational materials along with out ML backed algorithms to deliver information in a straightforward manner. Users would get to know more about how to deal with cataracts. To ease users into the app, plenty of animations were implemented to guide users around the app, making sure that buttons are reused and minimal learning is required. "", 'We could not find any publicly available annotated dataset for eye images affected with Cataract. The idea behind having a labeled dataset was the ease of usage of powerful supervised learning algorithms. Since, we were not able to get the labeled data, we scraped images from Google Image Search manually and built a non-annotated dataset, for Machine Learning purposes. We also tried to extend this work over another eye disease Conjunctivitis, but we could not get good results owing to the dataset that we had. Since this is a Health hack and we do not want to recommend random suggestions to the patients, we decided not to include it with EyePhone. ', 'We are happy to present an application that tries to positively impact the lives of the people. Our application is at a one-click launch able stage. We believe our application would be a useful tool not only for the general population but also to the medical industry. We also believe that EyePhone is not only capable of detecting cataract at an early, but also acts as an interactive tool that helps to educate the general population.  ', 'We learned a lot about Computer Vision techniques and ways to play with image-related datasets. We also realized how important it is to do image preprocessing and image enhancement before we use Machine Learning algorithms to train and test the data.

This means that when seeking medical treatment providers may be unaware of things like medical conditions, allergies to medicine, and previous medical history. Our goal is to create an inexpensive, scalable system to allow access to medical records for all.

Jack is 5-years-old and LOVES all things nature. Every day he'd look forward to getting a new Super Creature Showdown. Each morning I'd work to make them more and more elaborate, ultimately turning it into a math-based game with the goal of being fun and educational. This past Christmas we got an Echo Show and we thought it would be a great winter break project to build out a voice-based game. "", ""Super Creature Showdown tests your math skills in a fun, 3 round battle to determine each creature's Strength, Speed and Smarts. In each round you answer by saying which creature had the greater score. In the 4th, and final, Showdown round you add up the scores for each round and say the winning creature's score. At the end of each game a fun fact is revealed about the Showdown winner.In keeping with the tradition of Jack's lunch box games, I wanted Super Creature Showdown to have a physical component. Each Showdown has a companion PDF that can be printed and used as a game board to keep score. Showdowns can be downloaded from SuperCreatureShowdown.com "", 'Super Creature Showdown was truly a family effort. My wonderful wife, Katie, teaches 2nd grade, and her insight into education was a huge benefit in helping make the game fun, educational and age appropriate. Certainly Jack was a huge inspiration, and even our 2-year-old, Luke, got involved.We built the game by starting on paper and working out the game logic and pacing. I then moved into coding using the Alexa Skills Kit SDK for Node.js. The SDK made it really fun to develop for Alexa, and leveraging Amazon Web Services made everything fast and efficient. I opted to have an external config file hosted on Amazon S3. This allows me to easily add new Showdowns without having to republish the skill. ', ""Time. Time. Did I mention time? I worked on development over winter break, so coding between holiday events, parties and just everyday life made for quite a sprint. Don't get me wrong, it was a ton of fun. Also, working on UX for voice is really challenging – Things you take for granted on a website, or in an App, really present unique scenarios with voice. On a whole, I loved every minute of it.

She also teaches 2nd grade, so having her insight into how to help structure the math-based game play was also a huge help. My son, Jack, was a rockstar\xa0– He helped with ideas, debugging and testing. It was really cool to see him watch the development process and how excited he was about it. We did a lot of tests with custom audio, so it was also fun to seem him learn about recording sound, recognizing audio as waveforms and starting to understand volume.

None of the current solutions on the market have yet have come to dominate and establish themselves as a defacto standard. This creates challenges for new communities when trying to select a system, often resulting in a perverse cycle of creating yet another management system that only sort of works for that particular community.At an high-level, these are the issues preventing widespread adoption of a single system:each system is often the result of a part-time or short-term volunteer effortsdifficult to reach a critical mass of users adoption necessary to sufficient generalize the systemchallenges in creating a critical mass of developers around the open source projectpoor understanding of global requirements (i18n/l10n, payment gateways integration, taxes, etc)hard for individual communities to evaluate the software quality attributes of a particular systemcomplexity in maintaining the software solutions and the data it generatesThis results in numerous problems, among which:time spent on management instead of makingredundant efforts invested in systemslack of support and long term maintenancelack of a defacto standard API to third party components (door locks)Frederic Bazin (founder of agora-space.com) and Ricky Ng-Adam (cofounder of xinchejian.com) with the help of Julien Choulet (a new active member and MeteorJS specialist) face these challenges regularly.

"Confucius","Confucius offers a revolutionary way for people to obtain information, giving users so much more than just news.","[6736, ""Confucius is the combination of Spotify music, Soundcloud, and breaking news in one package.The inspiration came from the fact that as university students, we don't have the time to constantly be looking for the best news sources. We also don’t have time to sit down and read the news diligently, especially when we are busy. Not only that, we found that with existing news applications, we were visually distracted while online, and were not able to just listen to the articles on these websites. We came up with an app that aggregates multiple news sources and translates their articles to audio, enabling users to take news with them on the go. "", 'With one tap, the user is able to listen to any article from playlists, trending articles of the day, and different genres from top news sources, in order to give the users the latest news on the go. Unlike other news app where users have to scroll through articles to read them, Confucius allows the user to LISTEN to an article. With our hands-free news app, we give users so much more than just news. We give users the freedom to be informed while on the go. ', 'Confucius is composed of three primary components: WEB SCRAPER, CLOUD BACKEND, iOS USER INTERFACE.WEB SCRAPER:     In order to populate our cloud implementation backend with text articles, we had to create a web scraper using Kimono Labs technology. Written in JavaScript and Python, we were able to crawl multiple websites ranging from BBC news, The New York Times, to the Onion and National Geographic. Using Heroku, and cloud logic, we are able to automate this web scraping process to grab the latest articles at regular time intervals. That way, our cloud database is always up to date with the top most recent articles.CLOUD BACKEND:     We implemented our backend data storage with the Parse API, a cloud database implementation. Following web scraping, we interfaced this database with iOS querying methods to easily write to and write from our cloud database. Most importantly, this database enabled us to populate our front end user interface with all the most up to date articles, hottest news article playlists, etc.iOS UI/UX:     In order to take advantage of our solid backend, we had to build a front end capable of reflecting all the information in the cloud to the user in a simple and intuitive way. Every part of our UI/UX has been thought about, and we have taken validated User Interface tips from other top mobile applications.     We decided that a Tab bar is the most straightforward and intuitive way to show all the pages in our application, taking only one tap to change from page to page. On each page, useful indicators enable users to intuitively navigate our application with satisfying swipe and tap gestures.. ', ""While we were able to complete implementing most of the features that we had designed in the beginning, we found it difficult to strike a balance between simplicity and complexity. Simplicity is always welcomed in terms of user experience; however, we felt that there were certain relatively 'complex' features that benefited the user experience. The only way to figure this out is from user feedback and we hope to keep incorporating data to maximize the user experience. "", ""We are most proud of the fact that we considered all aspects of a potential business when designing this application, keeping in mind that a successful app hinges on our FIT with customer demands/preferences, designing a product that customers actually WANT and that competitors have yet to MAKE.We take pride in the fact that we have placed deep thought about the business model, and how users will interact with the application.The beauty of Confucius lies in its smooth and enjoyable UX/UI, and we're proud that we have accomplished just that.We truly believe that users will enjoy the freedom that this application bestows on the user to be informed on the go, creating a product that other news apps simply don’t have. "", 'This is our first hackathon and the biggest difference was the fact that we had discussed about our ideas beforehand. Coming into Junction, we already had a clear, general idea of what we wanted to make, and as soon as we got here, we were able to utilize the available resources to implement our idea quickly. With this time advantage, we were able to concentrate more on the app design, UX, and UI, which gives our app greater leverage over competitors.

"CloudSonar","Let CloudSonar find an event you should watch","[4364, 'The critical event any IT service provider cares is a service outage(e.g. HTTP 5xx response). But there are just too many variables. uptime, Java gc counts/time, CPU, I/O util, swap memory usage, etc.Whenever you try to detect a service outage before it happens, you get screwed up by those countless variables.One day, I noticed Apache Cassandra uses a very simple metrics to detect a node failure, which is based on the following theory.http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~defago/files/pdf/IS_RR_2004_010.pdfThis inspired me to try HTM against simple PING response times to predict possible high load that could generate an error. ', ""It polls a given set of nodes by PING periodically. Then, record its response times, and which are fed to PhiFailureDetector and HTMAnomalyDetector to detect an important event to watch out.Please refer to Concept on my project for details.Case StudyThe case study I have investigated was done on a 6 nodes Cloudian HyperStore(S3 object storage) cluster. You can simply think of it as a distributed file system with a web interface. All the HTTP requests were routed to cloudian-node1, then distributed among 6 storage services. The traffic pattern I used was a constantly high traffic for this cluster, which would produce an error if some more requests had been added.To make it overloaded, a temporal random traffic surge was added every hour. Then, as expected, 6 errors were observed as follows.Now, the first question is if this tool could have provided a useful information based on anomaly score by HTM before they happened.The followings are examples against node1 taken on node3.HTM inputs, log10 of response time in micro seconds, looked like this.This looks there is no direct indication of such an error. For example, around 6:50, there were 4 503 errors. But no particular spike there. There could be a hidden pattern, but may be not. Let's see.And this is the distribution. 2.5 is around 300 micro seconds.PhiFailureDetector shows a server health. It is below 1.0, if it is fine. The lower, the better. You can set a horizontal line(threshold) to identify a bad node.Here, as you can see, there are so many high values over 1.0. Some spikes are even beyond 10(0.0000001%). This indicates that the server was under high load.A PHI value is a good indication of server health, but simply lowering a threshold doesn't really help. For example, if you would set 2.0, the first alarm could have been given around 22:10, followed by many more alerts. You may try 5.0 to avoid too many alarms. But you still have no idea if this is OK or not. HTMAnomalyDetector allows you to see a vertical line instead of a horizontal line(threshold), which indicates an anomaly, the time when unexpected pattern was observed against its prediction(max in the next 30 seconds).As you can see, HTM detected whenever a pattern has changed.ConclusionCloud Sonar is not an oracle, so can not tell when an error could happen. But Cloud Sonar is confirmed that it can give an anomaly whenever a pattern changes.If you look back a pattern when your server got overloaded, then you'll see the first point that became higher than its usual pattern. And it must be the first possible point you could be notified.So, the best way to deal with an unexpected event is to know as soon as possible when a change is observed. And it is what Cloud Sonar can provide. "", 'Using HTM.java, and Swarming to find optimal configurations. ', 'HTM parameter tunings.=> Let Swarming find==> Takes long...  HTM input scale.

Residents can decide which washers or dryers they would like to use, update the bot, check the amount of time left and also receive notification when their load is done. Additionally, the userId of the resident on telegram would be tied to the washer/dryer, thus it is possible to send a message via the bot to the previous user to collect their clothes if they did not. Once the time is up, the washer/dryer would be available again. ', 'We wrote the bot with Node.js and Telegram-bot API, with the help of Firebase SDK.

"TruClinic","Delivering the tools and data healthcare providers need across all care settings and into the home","[8564, ""Justin Kahn was struck in the head with a baseball bat when he was 14 years old. In his teens and twenties, he would suffer from anxiety and panic attacks. When Justin was 27, he had a panic attack that scared him into seeking out the help of a neurologist. After working with her for almost a year, she discovered that he did not have PTSD. Instead, what he had been experiencing for 13 years, were seizures that were caused by the traumatic brain injury. She put him on an anti-seizure medication that alleviated what he had been experiencing.In 2009, he read an article that was in the speech that Robert Gates, the former Secretary of Defense, gave to the graduating class of West Point. He said that the Department of Defense was going to begin investing billions of dollars each year to address the PTSD epidemic plaguing all branches of the military. Justin grew up around the VA. His stepfather was an administrator for the VA. He thought that the way to address this problem would be to establish a relationship at the beginning of the service member’s career with their home state VA and have it continue into the rest of their lives. He knew from his own experience that the most effective mechanism for him to deal with his seizures, which can be similar to the symptoms of PTSD, was having someone to talk to. A lot has been done to address mental health in the military, but there are some service members that do not proactively address the issues they are dealing with. The reason is there can be a stigma attached with having mental health issues, as well as real world implications because they can be pulled away from their unit, possibly lose rank or pay, get passed over for advancement, or even be discharged. The result is, as troops transition to veteran status, some come back suffering from traumatic experiences that are having a dramatic effect on their transition back to civilian life. Justin approached the Salt Lake VA with the idea of having active duty troops being able to meet with VA practitioners from their home state while deployed, and have it be done through secure video conferencing. The VA agreed to test the concept of online care by teaching relaxation exercises to a small group veterans to see if they would have the same retention rate or better as doing in-person. When Justin received pre-seed capital in 2012 to start TruClinic, he approached his friend and software engineer, Trevor Wilkin. Justin Kahn/CEO and Trevor Wilkin/CTO have known each other since 2007, and have worked on multiple creative projects together. Brian Russon was originally introduced to TruClinic while he was with Microsoft and looking for Surface use cases in healthcare, of which we were utilizing with the University of Utah’s NICU unit.

Alex has over 10 years in the EHR industry and is now TruClinic's Head of Product. Vitaly is the co-Founder of IDEOM and Ego7 and is now TruClinic's VP of Engineering.

"", 'Trevor Wilkin and Jon Fuller/Director of Customer Support were the driving force of the first two iterations of the TruClinic platform. The first version was built on a LAMP stack using Javascript. Version 1.0 used a Flash based video codec. TruClinic was an early adopter of WebRTC for the video codec which was rolled out in Version 2, along with moving away from Javascript and into Node.js and Angular. Version 3 (code name: Olympus) is built on Node.js, Angular, React and Typescript.  ', 'We believed that TruClinic would be the solution that providers would flock to. The thought at first was to get customers, regardless of size of practice or length of sales cycle. We were not charging enough either. The positive side of the challenge was that we got a birds eye view into all different types of healthcare providers. The negative side was that we did not have a cohesive sales strategy and it was very hard to predict revenue. Small practices were easy to sell to, but they had high attrition rates because they did not have the infrastructure or budget to implement a successful and scalable telemedicine strategy. Enterprise customers have the infrastructure and budgets, but the sales cycles can be anywhere between 6 months to 2 years. This experience helped to shape the customer acquisition strategy and that helped us focus on hone in on our sales process.Fundraising was also a major challenge. As a small company where everyone is wearing multiple hats, the time and resources needed to fundraise were taking away from other tasks that needed to be completed. The executive team decided to raise the least amount of funds possible and to bootstrap for as long as possible. The whole team learned to operate using lean methodology and kept the growth in line with revenue. The company was not able to grow as fast as it had projected, but it gave us time to work out all the bugs before it was ready to scale. ', 'TruClinic was a winner of the Village Capital/VentureWell/SOURCE/Hitachi Foundation accelerator in 2014. The company is also an alumni of the Startup Bootcamp Miami accelerator in 2016. TruClinic currently has 11 employees and 7 independent contractors. The technology has been featured in trade organizations and publications such as The Advisory Board, AGC Partners, IDC Global Insights, the Journal of mHealth & Healthcare IT News. The company has two issued patents which outline the process for browser based online healthcare consultations (US Patent 8,718,245 and US Patent 9,374,394) with a third in review. TruClinic currently has 25 customers spanning 4 continents, in 7 countries and in all 50 states. ', 'The use cases for telehealth are as broad as the providers and the patients they care for. We have learned that our customers want a flexible technology with a modular feature set that they can scale throughout their entire organization. We have also learned that healthcare moves at different paces, depending on the priorities, budget, internal teams, etc. We learned to work with our customers to develop the strategies and deployment plans that will lead to a successful rollout. We treat our customers like partners and learn as much from them as they do from us. ', ""We will be doing a fundraise at the end of Q1/2017 for sales and marketing scale. On the technology front, we will be integrating biometric, biofeedback and wearable feeds intro TruClinic sessions, and will continue with additional EHR integrations. The future is bright and we're all wearing shades.

"Driverless Arduino 101 Rover","A demonstration of vehicle to vehicle communication technology and active collision avoidance.","[15958, 'Many kinds of everyday automation exist in the world of today. Home control systems allow you to control lights in your house over the internet, coffee makers start before you wake up, and you can release a small robot to vacuum your floor.While not everyone may have the need for a robotic vacuum, or want to control their house over the internet, it is extremely difficult if not impossible to find someone in the developed world who will be left unaffected by self driving vehicles. You won’t even have to own one to have your life revolutionized by them. Public transportation will become driverless, traffic flows will become seamless, and people will even release their cars out into their local area to work as taxis for them!These vehicles will need to use collision avoidance systems, still being perfected today, to stay out of the way of obstacles such as people, signs, the side of the road, and other vehicles. This kind of system is adequate in today’s world, full of traffic lights and conscious drivers, but another technology will need to be proven before humans get off the road. This technology is vehicle to vehicle communication. Without this, driverless cars will be restricted to relying on local sensors, and the traffic jams of today will only become worse. Using vehicle to vehicle communication, not only can cars practice actions such as synchronized acceleration and deceleration, alleviating these jams, but can talk to each other ahead of an intersection to avoid a collision. The latter was the focus of this project.My project used an Arduino 101, along with some electronic sensors, to convert an old remote-control car into an intelligent, driverless vehicle that can communicate with other vehicles in order to avoid an imminent collision, along with being able to avoid simple obstacles. ', ""The vehicle has two main functions:Continuous Collision Avoidance ModeIn this mode, I simply send the vehicle an “On” signal through bluetooth, and it turns on the rear motor. I can then step back and watch it avoid trees, houses, chairs people, and just about anything else it encounters in its path. The vehicle can successfully navigate an obstacle course on its own.Demo of Driverless Vehicle to Vehicle Communication in an IntersectionThis mode exists to show what an intersection between two cars might look like in a future with vehicle to vehicle communication. The scenario goes as follows: Two cars, at least one of them driverless, are approaching an intersection of two roads, one vehicle traveling on each road. When the driverless car receives information indicating the other car is approaching dangerously from the other road, it slows down and/or stops to avoid a collision. In this mode, I can connect the driverless Arduino 101-powered vehicle to another vehicle with an onboard computer. The other vehicle is a simple RC car being controlled by a human being, with an onboard computer running linux that is bluetooth enabled. This mode is tested in the following way: the two vehicles are connected and sent on a possible collision course. The Arduino receives GPS information from the RC vehicle, and determines if the two are headed for a collision. If so, the Arduino vehicle will stop and let the RC vehicle pass by.How It WorksThe vehicle is built upon an old hobbyist remote-control car chassis, and uses the servo motor, motor controller, battery, and rear motor of the vehicle. The Arduino 101 serves as the brain of the vehicle, processing input from different kinds of sensors.Continuous Collision Avoidance ModeWhen powered on, the Arduino becomes visible to bluetooth devices. I wrote an iOS application using Swift and loaded it onto an iPad. The application is simply a switch in the center of the screen that appears upon connecting with the Arduino 101. The switch represents a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) characteristic. When the switch is off, it sets the characteristic to 0, and when it is on, it sets the characteristic to 1. 20 times a second, the Arduino does two things. The first thing is check the state of the characteristic. If the characteristic is 0, it shuts off its rear motor and stops checking for collisions. If the characteristic is 1, it turns the rear motor on and starts checking for collisions. The second thing the Arduino does is, as already mentioned, check for collisions. It does this using three ultrasonic sensors placed in the front of the vehicle. One of the sensors is facing directly in front of the vehicle, and the other two are angled to the left and right of the direction the vehicle is facing. If a distance is measured by one of the sensors that is considered dangerous, the Arduino will check the offset sensor readings for a clear path, and turn in the direction that gives it the most space.Demo of Driverless Vehicle to Vehicle Communication in an IntersectionThere are two cars involved in this demonstration. The first is the self-driving Arduino 101 powered rover, and the second is a regular, human controlled RC car with a raspberry pi and a GPS on board. The cars are placed away from each other and oriented so that they will both converge on the same point, like an intersection. I then remotely run a python script I wrote on the raspberry pi, which connects with the Arduino through bluetooth, and once connected, writes the vehicle's track angle to the bluetooth characteristic. Once connected, the Arduino starts moving, and the human drives the raspberry pi car into the path of the Arduino. After a delay of a couple seconds, the Arduino car reads its own track angle (the direction it’s moving) from its GPS and the other car’s track angle over bluetooth. The Arduino then decides whether or not the cars could collide. If a collision is possible, the Arduino stops and lets the raspberry pi car pass.Challenges I ran intoThere were so many challenges involved with carrying out this project, and some of the most difficult were not even software related!In the beginningI like to divide my projects up into individual tests that demonstrate the different technologies needed to complete the project, and then bring them all together. One of the first tests, reverse engineering the motor controller, proved to be quite challenging. Since the controller was designed to be controlled via a radio receiver, not much documentation exists as to which input produces which output. I had to sit down and write some test programs that looped through different analog outputs and tested different PWM pulse lengths in order to find which ones caused the motor to run at different speeds or spin in different directions.Simple electronics can sometimes be not so simpleProbably the most significant problem that took up entire days of work on this project was caused by the power supply. Initially, I discovered that the controller had a 5 volt output pin, supplied by the motor battery, and attempted to use this to power the vehicle components. However, I soon found out that with many sensors, a GPS, an Arduino, and a servo motor, the output was simply not powerful enough, and this caused a lot of weird behavior. After hours of fiddling with the hardware, I ended up using a USB power bank to power the Arduino, and using the motor controller output to power the rest of the vehicle. Since a lot of the power was used in outputting signals from the Arduino, this solution worked very nicely.GPS nightmareI used two Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout Boards for this project, and would recommend them to anyone else in a heartbeat. However, unfortunately, I found that my Arduino 101 hardware serial did not work with them, and I ended up having to write my own GPS library including an NMEA sentence parser in order to work with them. I was able to get them to work using SoftwareSerial, and I plan to upload my library and solution to GitHub in order to help out anyone else who may come across the same dilemma.AccomplishmentsCreating a Reliable Obstacle Avoidance SystemI started out just giving the rover the ability to dodge small obstacles in its path. Now, with my most updated code, the rover almost looks alive when weaving through an obstacle course.Demonstrating Vehicle to Vehicle CommunicationThe Arduino 101 powered rover successfully stops on analysis of data transmitted from another moving vehicle near it.I also found out some useful things about vehicle to vehicle communication. The intersection demonstration uses the track angles of the rovers to determine if they will collide. In a real world application, a more advanced system would need to be deployed, as explained below, since a system only using the two track angles has the potential to calculate false positives. Through tests of more advanced systems that used more measurements from the GPS and more sophisticated ways to calculate a potential collision, I learned a lot about this technology. 1) Bluetooth does not have the range to support this communication in full. Bluetooth also takes time to connect, and does not reliably stay connected between two moving vehicles even if they are in range.2) A more accurate method of location must be used in order to implement full collision detection in an intersection using more than just track angles. Either a much more accurate GPS is required, or more likely, an assisted GPS system possibly using cell towers.Why this is so:If the Raspberry Pi supported a larger bluetooth range, the vehicles could have been started at a greater distance from each other, and more information could have been collected up to the intersection, allowing for a more accurate collision avoidance calculation. I attempted demonstrations where the vehicles start out of bluetooth range, building up a history of data as they move, and connect once in range, but the bluetooth technology on board the Raspberry Pi had lots of trouble connecting the two vehicles while they were moving. I wrote an Arduino sketch that read both vehicles' latitude, longitude, speed, and track angle, and used their position history to plot their paths as lines on an Equirectangular Grid Model of the Earth. The Arduino then found the intersect of the lines, and used the two vehicles' velocities to determine if they would be at the intersection at the same time. This demonstration worked using test values, but the aforementioned limitations of the GPS and Bluetooth hardware led to inaccurate and untimely readings. In order to be utilized in a real intersection between two cars, these calculations would need to be supplied with data from an assisted GPS and a larger Bluetooth range.What I learnedArduino!I had never touched an Arduino before this project, and I have come to love how easy it is to automate things with one.C++Before this project I had worked with Java, Swift, Python, PHP, and SQL, but my past projects did not require any programs written in C++. Since the Arduino compiles C++, I learned a lot about the language, especially when writing the GPS library and NMEA sentence parser.NMEA DataIt was very cool to learn what most GPSs output, and how to interact with the GPS in order to get the information desired.Bluetooth Low EnergyI had always had a small fascination with bluetooth, and writing code that worked with it was very cool to me. I enjoyed how easy the Arduino 101 BLE API was to use.PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)I had used PWM in the past to control servo motors, but this project took me into the details of it. I learned the different between PWM frequency, duty cycle, and pulse length.What's next for Self Driving Arduino RoverStarting my first year of college in about a month, there will be many more resources for me to use in developing my projects. This will open up many possibilities to where this could go. I plan to continue developing the rover, adding different sensors to it and giving it new and improved capabilities. In college and beyond, I will use my knowledge of GPS, BLE, micro controllers, and more gained during this project to aid future efforts in making this planet a safer, more efficient, and more exciting place to live.Testing InstructionsContinuous Collision Avoidance ModePlace the rover in a fairly open area (such as a playground, backyard, gymnasium, etc), with at least 2 meters of space in between the front of the vehicle and the nearest obstacleSupply power to the Arduino by plugging in the cable attached to the power supply, and turn on the Electronic Speed ControlWait 5-15 secondsOpen iPad Rover Controller ApplicationWait for on/off switch to appear in center of iPad screenTurn switch on to start the back motor of the rover and enable collision avoidanceThe rover should start moving forwards and turning its front wheels left or right when it approaches an objectVehicle to Vehicle Communication Intersection DemonstrationPlace the driverless Arduino rover and the RC raspberry pi rover about 9 meters apart (try closer if the vehicles are failing to connect, the raspberry pi 3 has a relatively small bluetooth range)Orient the two vehicles such that they are pointing towards a common point, from directions around 90 degrees relative to each otherPlug the raspberry pi and the Arduino, turning the two devices on, and turn on the Electronic Speed Control on the Arduino roverWait until both GPSs indicate a fix (when the blinking red light on the GPS starts blinking much less frequently)SSH into the raspberry pi and start the intersection demo python programOnce the Arduino rover starts moving, using the Remote Control, drive the raspberry pi rover into the path of the Arduino rover, so that they are on a collision path and moving in directions around 90 degrees relative to each otherDo not stop raspberry pi rover; drive it straight through the intersectionThe Arduino rover should now stop and let the raspberry pi rover passNote: for both the sketches, the pulse length that determines the speed of the Arduino rover is defined by a C++ macro. The rover must be set at a lower pulse width (higher speed) to be able to move through the grass, but must be set to higher pulse width (lower speed) in order to achieve the same velocity on pavement (the rover goes way too fast on pavement if set to the grass speed). A pulse width of between 1050 and 1080 work well in the grass, and 1120 works well on level pavement. Pulse widths in between will achieve different speeds as well. A pulse width of 1140 will stop the rover completely.Built Witharduinoc++pythonraspberry-piswiftTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    Intel Hacks 2017    Created by  This was a one man team!Chris BlustComputer Engineering student at Rochester Institute of Technology, class of 2022.

Now, with my most updated code, the rover almost looks alive when weaving through an obstacle course.Demonstrating Vehicle to Vehicle CommunicationThe Arduino 101 powered rover successfully stops on analysis of data transmitted from another moving vehicle near it.I also found out some useful things about vehicle to vehicle communication. The intersection demonstration uses the track angles of the rovers to determine if they will collide. In a real world application, a more advanced system would need to be deployed, as explained below, since a system only using the two track angles has the potential to calculate false positives. Through tests of more advanced systems that used more measurements from the GPS and more sophisticated ways to calculate a potential collision, I learned a lot about this technology. 1) Bluetooth does not have the range to support this communication in full. Bluetooth also takes time to connect, and does not reliably stay connected between two moving vehicles even if they are in range.2) A more accurate method of location must be used in order to implement full collision detection in an intersection using more than just track angles. Either a much more accurate GPS is required, or more likely, an assisted GPS system possibly using cell towers.Why this is so:If the Raspberry Pi supported a larger bluetooth range, the vehicles could have been started at a greater distance from each other, and more information could have been collected up to the intersection, allowing for a more accurate collision avoidance calculation. I attempted demonstrations where the vehicles start out of bluetooth range, building up a history of data as they move, and connect once in range, but the bluetooth technology on board the Raspberry Pi had lots of trouble connecting the two vehicles while they were moving. I wrote an Arduino sketch that read both vehicles' latitude, longitude, speed, and track angle, and used their position history to plot their paths as lines on an Equirectangular Grid Model of the Earth. The Arduino then found the intersect of the lines, and used the two vehicles' velocities to determine if they would be at the intersection at the same time. This demonstration worked using test values, but the aforementioned limitations of the GPS and Bluetooth hardware led to inaccurate and untimely readings. In order to be utilized in a real intersection between two cars, these calculations would need to be supplied with data from an assisted GPS and a larger Bluetooth range.What I learnedArduino!I had never touched an Arduino before this project, and I have come to love how easy it is to automate things with one.C++Before this project I had worked with Java, Swift, Python, PHP, and SQL, but my past projects did not require any programs written in C++. Since the Arduino compiles C++, I learned a lot about the language, especially when writing the GPS library and NMEA sentence parser.NMEA DataIt was very cool to learn what most GPSs output, and how to interact with the GPS in order to get the information desired.Bluetooth Low EnergyI had always had a small fascination with bluetooth, and writing code that worked with it was very cool to me. I enjoyed how easy the Arduino 101 BLE API was to use.PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)I had used PWM in the past to control servo motors, but this project took me into the details of it. I learned the different between PWM frequency, duty cycle, and pulse length.What's next for Self Driving Arduino RoverStarting my first year of college in about a month, there will be many more resources for me to use in developing my projects. This will open up many possibilities to where this could go. I plan to continue developing the rover, adding different sensors to it and giving it new and improved capabilities.

Most people “ngaret” when doing their daily activity or often this activity give bad impact on other people around them including to us. Such thing inspires us to solve the bad culture by developing an android-based application.During the development process, we investigate and discuss with those people who likes “ngaret” and found that there are two factors caused which is Internal and External factors. We define the Internal factor caused such as habit (or we call it previously as culture), laziness, and forget, while the external factors are traffic, accident, or natural disasters.Referring to the above factors, we assume that the main reason of the “ngaret” is “HABIT” and the only solution is moving on and realizing the negative effects if we do our activity “ngaret” instead of being punctual. In conclusion, Faster “Ngaret” habit you remove, Faster advantages you will get. Be Punctual not Ngaret!

"Guru","A mobile app that utilizes live streaming technology to bring students high-class education in an effective manner","[7603, ""In today's world, there are experts in every field. Your neighbors, your best friends, people you see every day or those you have never met could be possible experts or at least knowledgeable in the field of your question. Instead of having to find clunky explanations online, search and filter through hours of youtube content, or even set up meetings with tutors days in advance to understand concepts, problems or doubts, Guru saves the day.  "", 'Guru is a native iOS application that utilizes live streaming instructional technology that instantaneously connects students with ""Gurus"" in an effective learning environment. If you ever had to ask a quick question or understand a certain topic, Guru is the app for you. You sign in to the application stating what topics you\'re comfortable teaching. You can either ask a question to a global audience of gurus or you can see a list of questions that students are asking related to your skills. Gurus receive instantaneous push notifications or in-app alerts that their presence is requested. When the guru accepts the student\'s question, they are both simultaneously taken into a Live Video Call, through which the guru can explain the problem. We have seamlessly integrated a collaborative whiteboard in the stream, allowing the guru to draw on the screen and explain difficult concepts.  ', 'Guru is a native iOS app backed with a nodeJS powered Parse Server, a popular open source deployment framework. We host our server on Heroku’s powerful infrastructure which allows us to easily deploy new server side changes via a git command line and manage performance in an integrated environment. For the client side languages, most of the app is written in Apple’s Swift 3.0 with Objective C libraries as well. Cocoapods was our dependency manager and proved to be very useful in organizing the external packages we used. For live video streaming/conferencing, we used Twilio to deliver fast and reliable content streams connecting the Guru and student. There is native Twilio code running in the app, as well as a server component hosted on our backend for authenticating users with the service before granting them access to a session. The real time whiteboard that is provided during a call is powered by the open source Live Query server project which facilitates web socket connectivity for efficiently sharing coordinate points across devices to create the effect a continuous line is being drawn live. A separate portion of our Heroku instance (dyno) manages this live websocket system. We use a MongoDB database hosted on MLab which has proven to be fast and very adaptable to our needs. ', 'Setting up the Live Video StreamAside from coming up with the idea for Guru (which took over 3 hours between all of us), we faced two main technical challenges. They consisted of implementing a video chat service in our app along with having a live whiteboard to draw on during a video call. At first, the idea of a video chat system seemed daunting and we researched possibilities of transcoding and delivering our own content across infrastructure providers such as AWS, but in the end Twilio was found to be a less difficult way to build out this feature while allowing time to focus on the app and interface. We coded a demo app before integrating video with the main Guru platform and divided up tasks such as researching various APIs, efficient server management with video, and designing/developing user interfaces for the product. Integrating a Collaborative WhiteboardWe thought this would be the most difficult feature, but as we soon found out an even harder task was to build the dynamic drawing system. This required setting up a continuous websocket connection to avoid unnecessarily polling a server for new points to download and wasting precious resources. Parse’s newly open sourced Live Query project was slightly complicated and had minimal documentation but after many hours we figured out how to receive subscription alerts for newly updated points and were able to complete this feature. There were many other smaller challenges such as how to properly assign and delegate tasks among our group, as well as when to sleep (if at all!), but we are happy to have a finished product and to have overcome these challenges. ', ""Guru is a near-complete application. We delivered on all our promises, a fully functional and instantaneous live stream viewer, a fleet of push notifications to alert Gurus of requests and the integration of a collaborative whiteboard in the live stream to ensure a better learning experience for the student. The fact that we were able to complete this in a mere 36 hours speaks volumes. We're extremely proud that we were able to get this far, to get this functional app that allows anyone, anywhere to connect with a guru who could be anywhere in the World and still learn valuable information with ease. Developing this app seemed impossible in the beginning, but one by one, as we finished off tasks and created features, everything came together in the end.  "", ""The most important thing we learned is team-driven collaboration and the division of tasks to ensure maximum productivity. With such a complex app such as Guru, it was imperative we all were on the same page, focusing on different areas of the application and tying them in at the end into one superb app. This meant raging through intense git merges, trying to manage 3 people working on the same Xcode project and resolving major conflicts that seemed impossible. At the end of the day, however, we did it together and that's what matters.   "", ""The future of Guru is unlimited. We plan to publish this app in to the Apple App Store and promote this app between high school students and college students alike. The use case for this application is truly present - any person who has a doubt, a problem or a confusion can post a question in a couple of seconds, and 5 seconds later be talking to a Guru who's walking the student through what he or she needs to do. We hope to engage in productive conversations with students and leaders in the education industry to see how Guru can be a fit for teachers and students alike, gaining tractions and pushing this app to its limits.

"Medical Assistant","Feel the power of Alexa with a symptom Diagnosis Engine that actually gives your medical condition based on symptoms","[4932, ""My inspiration was my Grandmother who died when I was young due to Alzheimer''s. I was pretty young but I really wanted to do something to help her anyway I could. Eventually I did become a programmer and started exploring new technologies to ideate and innovate. I found the Alexa Skills Challenge on Devpost and put my registration in. So, I created this AI based Doctor that gives a user his/her diagnosis based on the symptoms. I knew that there are no existing apps in the market for public use that even remotely gives the user a steady description. I did my research. This allowed my to think freely and move in towards building my code. Hence, I built Medical Assistant. I kept the name simple as it is what it's name sounds to be. "", ""Medical Assistant is a skill with the most user friendly voice interaction model. To keep the user interested and satisfied I kept the number of questions to a minimum and gave a more precise answer. I really had to work on a better user experience. The Skill takes the input from the user about medical conditions and gives them a description about it's rarity and severity along with which department of doctors they should go see. But the USP of the skill is actually the Diagnosis based on Symptoms. Based on the user's statement, the skill asks follow up questions till it reaches a decision and finalizes the medical condition the user may be having and then suggests it and also recommends which type of doctor they should go see. This is something out-of-the-box and completely different from anything that exists in the market. It has over 10,000 follow up questions and the content is completely dynamic. "", 'I build the code using Node.js where I used REST API services and a self generating code body for handling follow-up questions. I built the code through Jenkins and Deployed it to AWS Lambda. I used a simple Atom Editor to code and my testing environment was EchoSim.io and the App on Android Playstore called Reverb. ', ""The basic challenge was accuracy. Sometimes even Alexa fails to understand the exact user utterance depending on ambient noise , accent and network issues. My skill had to be reliable and precise so I had to add a secondary layer of Natural Language Processing on top of Alexa's existing Intent builders and NLP engine. I did this with over 1600 slot values and handling a bulk of individual string variations in my code.The second challenge was the probability counter. My skill, Medical Assistant only gives the diagnosis when that probability counter reaches over 97% for any medical condition. This was done by careful mapping of medical conditions with their symptoms. It took me almost 2 months just to do that. Eventually I cracked the code and successfully made the entire package up and running. "", ""The final product is something exactly the one I had in my mind and hoped to build. Getting something exactly right as it is in mind and looking at your code built from scratch running flawlessly is an achievement on it's own. I've even gone ahead and showed it to several doctors who were really hyped and happy about it. People are really happy I'm giving away such a skill for free where enterprises actually charge people money for something like this. "", ""Thanks to this Alexa Skills Challenge 2017, I also got the drive to learn something new. In this regard, I learnt Node.js, Express.js as well as Alexa SDK and about AWS Lambda's Serverless platform. These skills came very handy some interviews as well. "", ""Medical Assistant will grow with time. I'll keep adding more modules to it like Searching nearby locations via Google Places APIs and giving contacts of Doctors as cards in Alexa Companion App, An AI based Diet Builder based on eating habits as well as Binaural Music to keep moods in check for Mentally Challenged People. I do have a plan. If I win this hackathon, I'm going to build this entire package and use that prize money to have premium API Services and Libraries and still keep the Skill Free for the Public so that people get what the need and deserve, A healthier and a better lifestyle.

I have studied music technology about ten years ago, so I felt a bit rusty creating the loops, but It was a great opportunity to catch up with some of my old college buddies to run my ideas past them and to get their feedback.There is also a known issue that I have encountered where card text overrides APL on the echo spot. I used to excellent Slack community to confirm this was a bug, and not me going mad!

"ConnectOnCommute","ConnectOnCommute is solving the problem of loneliness and disconnection by facilitating interactions with strangers","[5334, 'I was inspired to create ConnectOnCommute after experiencing my own new tribe moment moving out to Boston. I found it very challenging to break out and meet new people, make new friends, and really feel like I \'belonged\' in my community here. After a few weeks of feeling increasingly disconnected from my environment, I decided to put on a namebadge that said ""Ask me about tacos"". Within the 4 hours I had been wearing the badge, 14 different people would jokingly walk up and.. well.. ask me about tacos. Before I knew it I was having a random conversation with almost each one of them. After talking to some other people about my feelings at the beginning of my journey here, I found that I wasn\'t alone in feeling alone. It turns out 48% of Americans feel lonely most or all of the time, and 52% feel that no-one knows them well. Our brains have evolved to need social acceptance in much of the same way that we need food and oxygen- and it\'s because of this that many studies agree chronic loneliness can be more detrimental to our health than obesity and equivalent to smoking a pack of cigarettes a day.When I got to #HackHarvard2019, I had spent a lot of time thinking about that experience and wanted to see how my team could use tech to help foster a world of more deep, meaningful connections. Social media does a great job maintaining friendships once they start, but there\'s somewhat of a gap in initializing that first conversation; ConnectOnCommute was designed specifically do promote serendipitous interactions with the people to the left and right of us, all across our community.  ', ""ConnectOnCommute acts as an initiator for new, random conversations in real life with different people all around you in your community. Sometimes all we need is an invitation; users turn their 'social mode' on when they want to connect with others. As they're walking around, if another person in social mode is within range, both users receive a 'nudge' that includes the other person's name and a topic of interest to ask them about. Once both people click 'connect', a new connect-record is added to each users personal log.  "", 'The front-end was created with angular, typescript, and bootstrap; the back-end was developed using C#. ConnectOnCommute is hosted on an Azure server. ', ""The initial idea for the app involved using nfc or bluetooth to gage the range for the popup. Without the experience that would typically allow us to develop this kind of feature, we had to get creative with how to track location in a way that was accurate enough and allowed us to set parameters- this involved math... a lot of math... by pulling the gps longitude and latitude coordinates provided by every google chrome browser, we had to use trigonometry, conversion formulas, and advanced algebra to calculate the distance of any two coordinate points, and make it so that only people within 100 meters of each other would appear on each user's screen. It was challenging finding a new and creative way to get beyond this issue, however making it work felt really good when it was done. We also ran into some other minor technical issues, with things such as asynchronous functions/operations, typical bugs, and of course our favorite: syntax errors.  "", ""The biggest accomplishment was being able to roll out the completed, working, beta web-application within the 36 hour time period.

"Adroit","Your Critical Business Brand Barometer: Streamlined Problem Identification and Classification","[6198, 'In the development of Adroit, we were inspired by the design process itself - as we yearned to arrive at a chosen problem which would address healthcare, social good, fintech, education, or better yet a combination of the four. While brainstorming ideas for such problem statements, we agreed there was potential for using natural language processing to analyze frustrations and complaints, using human-centered design principles to light the way. We began designing a way to provide hackathoners and businesses with problem statements so they can focus on what they do best - solving them.Out of this idea came Adroit, an easy-to-use reputation and sentiment analysis tool. We sought a project that would challenge us with skills and frameworks which are new to us, while also keeping human-centered design in focus. Adroit is both a business/fintech tool - intended to help companies identify their weaknesses - as well as generalizable software which allows users to discover problems in any domain. Enter a search term and see what complaints people have about it, and get a summary of the most frequent commentary!  JetBlue use case: As one use case, Adroit was designed to meet @jetBlue\'s design requirements. We hypothesized that aggregating complaints from social media and analyzing their similarities could point to services that may need attention, indicating recent major customer concerns with the company. Although Adroit\'s knowledge is currently drawn specifically from Twitter and we do recommend further development using other data sources, a test run on recent data indicates, for instance, ""wheelchair"" and ""mobility"" as major concerns, identifying accessibility as potential business priorities. ', 'Adroit pulls data from Twitter about a certain target (e.g., ""JetBlue"") and uses Google\'s natural language API to find negative-sentiment content, indicating potential user complaints. After doing so, Adroit extracts high-importance terms from the data to indicate the general themes of those complaints. ', ""The client side uses React.js and support libraries, such as Material-UI and styled-components, alongside pure CSS. We use React’s routing to handle requests. We also used Axios to asynchronously fetch data from our API. Adroit is deployed on Firebase.The server side, hosted with PythonEverywhere, uses Python Flask to respond to requests for content analysis, which indicate the query target of the analysis and the amount of content to be analyzed. Query results are filtered using Google sentiment analysis and passed through an entity extraction step to determine a set of potential user concerns, which are returned alongside the analyzed tweets. Major challengesAs new hackers, we faced difficulties with environment management across the team, particularly in managing different Python and React setups. We also got the chance to work with some tools which were completely new to us, including complex APIs such as Google Cloud Language. And finally, we learned some new things about familiar concepts - for instance, we learned the hard fun way that single quotes aren’t accepted in JSON strings to JavaScript.Major accomplishmentsWith little experience and all being first-time MLH hackers, we're proud that we were able to integrate the frontend with the backend, gain an understanding of Google and Twitter APIs, and create a fully-working demo.

"NC.js","Machining on the Cloud with StepNC Data and MTConnect Data","[9419, ""When working with StepNC data our team realized that our project could be adapted to use real machining data. MTConnect allows our simultation to be used in much more powerful ways. We envision our project being used in various commercial applications to provide real time monitoring of several machines from one location. Through the use of this software, the efficiency of the manufacturing industry could also be improved by up to or exceeding 15%. The MTConnect data correlates well with STEP-NC data which is our team's main inspiration.  "", 'NC.js is an open source application designed tointerpret StepNC data and create a simulation of thedescribed workplan. NC.js has two options that allowthe user to either drive the simulation from a StepNC fileor instantiate a live viewing instance using a machinethat streams MT-Connect data. NC.js utilizesMTConnect data from a live machine to drive asimulation of the machining tool. Then, throughassociative kinematics, a machine or fixture can beadded to the simulation with correct movement inrelation to the tools. Real time machining informationcan be easily compared to the expected result, allowingmachining mistakes to be caught in process andcorrected, with the eventual goal of mistakes beingcaught before they happen. The current application is also mobile friendly so that livemachining simulations can even be viewed from anywhere by the people who needit most. ', 'The current setup of the simulation is an Okuma OSP-P300 on a LAN with the NC.js server.The Okuma feeds the MTConnect data to the server which then parses and uses it to drive thesimulation. MTConnect’s “PathPosition” tag is used to drive the position of the tool duringruntime, while the GCode block numbers allow us to determine the active working step anddisplay toolpaths relevant to the current operation. We also use MTConnect to determine thefeedrate of the tool. In the future we plan to compare it to the expected feedrate values forerror analysis. The backend uses Node.js and the frontend uses React.js in order to parse the MTConnect and STEP data that is attached to the live server.   ', 'NC.js has many parts that need to work together. Creating it requires learning the STEPNC library, Javascript, and understanding the machining process. If one part of the application breaks it affects every other component, making it hard to pinpoint the exact problem. This behavior requires everyone on the team to have an understanding the entire program in order to effectively add features or fix bugs. Adding an independent view of the geometry seems like an easy task, but required the way geometry is loaded to be refactored entirely. Another issue is that the underlying library is poorly documented and doesn’t always behave as intended. This means that when a problem arises it is difficult to tell if it’s a high-level issue, a low-level issue, or undocumented intended behavior.Accomplishments that we are proud ofSeeing the activity of a machining tool in real time allows for levels of oversight not otherwisepossible. NC.js enables supervision of an operation and confidence that tolerances are beingmet, without needing to be physically present for the machining of a part. Various tools can beused in the simulation in order to see if there will be any problems with a different size tool. Atool of the wrong size can be caught before machining begins by using the simulationenvironment to change what tool is being used on the machine.Because NC.js is designed to be web based it is possible for a part to be monitored anywherein the world. The software could be used in a commercial setting to prove the effectiveness ofnewly developed tools or optimized toolpaths.The largest possible benefit is in the potential automation of machining. Automaticallyensuring tolerances are being met could eliminate the need for human oversight.   Shown above in pink is some of the tolerance highlighting that is being done by NC.js as the Okuma is traversing each GCode operation. Tolerance highlighting will allow for the user tosee which of the current tolerances shown on the sidebar applies to the current workingstep.The end goal is to allow the user to change these tolerances and then save those changes toa new file. These tolerances also allow for error checking throughout the application to makesure that all operations complete correctly.Another benefit is the ability to view the geometry ,at various steps in the workplan, in aseparate pane. This will allow for STEP data to have 3D visualization that is before or after thecurrent working step being machined.The model shown above has annotations displayed throughout the model to show tolerances throughout the piece. The color data is also applied to the piece in order to give the user a better distinction between different parts of the scene. A workplan view is displayed on the sidebar to show the underlying workplan and all of the relevant workingsteps for each of the operations. The nested elements can be expanded to see the hierarchy of the workplan which is useful to machinists.The impeller model shown above has the bounding box of the tool and model highlighted. This box is used for many of the underlying rendering calculations. The impeller model also has some more intricate tolerances highlighted on the blades of the impeller which shows the potential of tolerance association with faces on a 3D model. The tools pane on the sidebar shows which tools are being used in the workplan.  Any tool that is defined within the workplan but isn\'t being used will be lowlighted in order to highlight important aspects to the user.The above shows the list of workingsteps, organized by setup. The simulation will pause in between each setup in order to simulate the need to change the orientation or tool of the machine. The toolpath is displayed and eventually a trace line to show any deviation will also be displayed.What we learnedDuring development we learned a good deal about web design with React components, as well as how to transition our simulation from using a preset path to the tool locations given by MTConnect. By saving state information at higher levels we are able to propogate changes to all components in a timely fashion. This enables all our UI elements to run in sync without losing information between transitions. Understanding how to read the MTConnect data took some time but proved to be a worthwhile time investment. The richness of the data allowed us to easily display all the relevant information. In addition we also were able to get important experience working as a team on a large code base, especially in regards to using Git as a source control tool. What\'s next for NC.jsFuture features will focus on statistical analysis and automatic detection of machining faults.Features that are currently being worked on include:Tracing the path of a toolProviding automatic calculations to determine possible deviations, detecting faultsbefore the entire part is machined incorrectlyComparing material removal to tolerances associated with each part faceThe ability for NC.js to make recommendations for feed rates and spindle speedsbased on optimization algorithmsVisually previewing tolerances, workpieces, and tools while the simulation continues inthe backgroundFurther goals are to allow for tolerances to be added or removed from a model using thesimulation.

"NEATVIBEwear","NEATVIBEwear is a personal real-time noise exposure monitoring and logging device","[10008, 'Every day we are exposed to harmful levels of noise and don\'t even realize it. Studies show the adverse impact of sustained or prolonged loud noise on our health is not just limited to hearing impairment, but can include increased risk of hypertension, heart disease and stress. Annoyance, sleep disturbance and decreased school performance are also sufficiently attributed to noise exposure (ref: Passchier-Vermeer W, Passchier WF (2000). ""Noise exposure and public health"". Environ. Health Perspect. 108 (Suppl 1): 123–31. doi:10.2307/3454637). Additionally, in occupational settings there are tools that have been developed delineating high-risk noise exposure zones based on point source measurement, but there is a need for a cost effective personal noise exposure capture device used for data collection and visualization in real-time. Deployment of ten or a dozen NEATVIBEwear devices in a single factory/plant production area is more cost effective than procurement of one industrial noise monitoring handheld device. To reliably assess exposure to occupational risk factors it is vital to have estimates of where workers spend their time and how they spend it. The study of Time Activity Patterns (TAP) attempts to answers these questions.  Most time-activity studies for health data collection are written in diaries or entered in on-line surveys, which are inherently biased due to differing degrees of recall and accuracy in reporting (ref: Time Activity Patterns in Exposure Assessment, EUR 15892 Report, EC Directorate on Science., R&D, 1995). Some TAP studies now can be mobile device enabled, but few (if any) record real-time noise exposure coupled with time-activity data. Fitness trackers have similar functionality, but do not include noise exposure.  Collection of accurate, cost-effective real-time TAP and noise exposure would enable factory or plant workers to better protect themselves from risk of hearing loss and other noise-associated harms as studies show work-induced hearing loss is a result of repetitive high noise exposure and workers who are overexposed to noise are at risk for developing hypertension (ref: Assessing High Noise Areas, G.Battista, OH&S, May 2016).The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) within the Center for Disease Control (CDC) has established exposure limits for various decibel (dB) ranges, and yet most people aren\'t aware of their exposure to noise nor exposure at various noise levels.Although there are smart phone apps that can measure dB levels, these apps are limited as they can produce false and/or interrupted readings resulting from phone calls, texts and/or when the app is closed. Additionally, the Smartphone sampling rates may be constrained and battery life can be a concern as well. Finally, if the Smartphone is off it can\'t capture noise level information.Hence, a Noise Exposure, Activity-Time and Vibration Wearable (NEATVIBEwear) device!! What NEATVIBEwear doesNEATVIBEwear is a personal noise capture device integrated to a Smartphone (for the purpose of displaying information) giving users the ability to:View real-time noise exposure at a glanceMonitor and track cumulative noise exposure either on the NIOSH scale or broader ""Health Risk"" scaleSave summary exposure information to log noise cumulative exposure over timeReview and understand available information regarding noise exposureHow we built itNEATVIBEwear is an integration between a personal noise capture device built using an Arduino 101 with the Grove Loudness Sensor (with the potentiometer for adjusting gain and a wide frequency range) and Android Smartphone running the gaming platform Unity as it provides the ability to render a representation of the real-time sound in a 3D color coded simulation. The Arduino 101 and the Smartphone are integrated through the Arduino 101\'s on-board Curie Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) capability.We use the standard formula (20*log10(V/Vo) to convert the electrical signal from the loudness sensor to dBs and then use additional mapping and smoothing calculations to calibrate the dB readings to external digital sound level meter (SLM) readings.

"Turnstyle","keeping score at every door","[10578, 'As college students, we found that we spent a lot of our time in lines--whether it was the line at the dining hall entrance, in front of the squat rack, or into the big basketball game.  While getting lost in some of these crowds is inevitable, a lot of frustration and waiting could have been avoided if we simply knew how congested these places were before we left our dorm rooms.  If we had a way to monitor everyone on campus, we could figure out when to head to the gym, find the ideal quiet studying spot, and determine when to line up at our favorite campus eatery.Of course monitoring everyone is not feasible--but perhaps we could get close.  We decided that all we needed to do was monitor all of the doors going in and out of each of these places of interest.  This would allow us to compute the population of our favorite places in real time -- and with this, help us plan our days better.  Ideally, we would like to have something to the effect of placing a turnstile near each of these doors.  However, conventional turnstiles are big and bulky, and no one likes having to walk through them everywhere they go.  Was there a way to do this in a less intrusive manner?We had previous experience using ultrasonic sensors and accelerometers in a biomedical devices laboratory in college, and we decided to combine these sensors into a more advanced occupancy sensor device. The Arduino 101 was simply the best device to develop on. The internal inertial motion unit, Bluetooth low-energy communications, I2C bus connectivity, Arduino community, and sensor module libraries all came together to produce a cohesive device for us.

It uses a combination of sensors that, to our knowledge, has not been used simultaneously in this way.  It allows us to help fight crowding and congestion in a non-invasive way, with no contact or interaction required by the people passing through.  It also detects movement in an anonymous way and preserves the privacy of the people it detects.Live UpdatingOur current build of the device streams population data directly to a mobile application and web application. Within a second of sensing movement in a doorway, it updates those applications and visualizations immediately. The speed at which this data is transferred improves the ability for further development of the device and the services it provides without appreciably reducing the speed at which it can deliver those services.  Furthermore, the Turnstyle can be used as a security feature if the door is unexpectedly opened -- perhaps outside of business hours.  Turnstyle seeks to serve both building managers -- in the form of a mobile application they can use to manage and monitor their Turnstyle --  and the general public -- with a widely available web application --  by providing both with valuable real time data.Powerful AnalyticsTurnstyle provides live population monitoring, helping people make educated decisions about where to head in the current moment.  It also provides aggregate measurements such as most popular times and general traffic trends to give people a general sense of how crowded places will be in the future.  We hope that the analytics that Turnstyle has to offer will help us better plan as a society and allow us to lead more efficient lives.  Just as people check the weather each morning, checking Turnstyle's data will encourage people to head to work at less busy times or eat at their favorite restaurants during slow hours -- saving us all from the pain of traffic jams, stalled roads, and wasted time.   "", ""Turnstyle UnitA magnetic contact switch is used in conjunction with the Arduino 101’s internal motion sensing to determine when the door opens.The precise angle that the door makes with the wall is computed using the Madgwick Filter.  When the door is opened beyond a threshold angle, the ultrasonic sensors on each side of the door start firing.  Depending on which sensor detects motion first, the directionality of people travelling through can be determined.The Arduino 101's internal BLE capabilities communicate with the mobile application.The Serial output of the Turnstyle is sent into a Node.js server to plot the results in real time.Any of these variables-- the threshold angle, the distance at which the ultrasonic sensors maximally operate, the directionality of traffic, can all be tuned to match the specific needs of each door. Real Time PlottingA Node.js server uses streams and plotly's streaming API to generate the plots in real time.  It parses the population data from Turnstyle's serial output and creates the plots on the fly.Mobile ApplicationOur mobile application is built using Evothings, a platform designed for creating IoT applications.  Evothings allowed us to write applications that could be run on Android, iOS, and Windows Phone in pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript.  We used Evothings's BLE libraries to allow the application to send and receive messages with the Arduino. "", 'We built an entire functional Android application on Android Studio, but it would only work for android 5.0 because of Bluetooth permission issues associated with 6.0+, so we had to scrap it and learn how to use Evothings in the span of two daysWe hit the API stream limit multiple times (at least 5) on plot.lyTwelve-hour time zone difference caused difficulties in testing and collaborating - two of us were in a different country for an entire month.Lots of difficulties getting Bluetooth to communicate in real time; we had no experience with it and had to learn a lot from the limited documentation. ', 'Using many features of the Intel Arduino 101 in our hack, including the built-in accelerometer, gyroscope, and Bluetooth modules.  We really felt like we were getting the most out of the hardware.Providing both an application and a web service for real time tracking and analyzing data - seeing how quickly our phones and computers responded to the Turnstyle was insanely satisfying.Inertial motion units are accurate within several minutes from baseline but have a strong tendency to “drift,” causing the device’s reported motion to be much different from its actual motion. This is troublesome in the case of tracking an object over a long period of time, but we were able to cleverly navigate around this by using the magnetic contact switch to notify when a baseline position in space was met. That way, “drift” over time doesn’t affect the device’s measurement of the door’s motion as we reset the drift to 0 each time the door is closed.Finishing without drinking any coffee ', 'Bluetooth is a lot more complicated than we initially gave it credit for -- we had to learn a lot about subscription models and UUIDs and the like.  It was also extremely difficult to debug, and the most unexplainable issues are often best solved by resetting the Bluetooth on the phone.Different versions of Android have different problems with Bluetooth -- we need to be more considerate of different versions of the same platform when developing future projects.All of Evothings and Plot.ly!  This was a great first experience with IoT, and we were surprised to see so many tools and technologies specifically designed for IoT projects.Each of us also became better hackers in general; other than Arduino, there was not a single technology we used for this project that all of us have used before! ', ""The biggest feature we have yet to implement is support for multiple simultaneous Turnstyles.  Since most large places have multiple doors, this is a very important feature.  Right now, we could probably implement support for a couple devices at a time (using BLE communication protocols and streaming Node servers), but support for extremely large public spaces (think museums and monuments) would require engineering for scalability.Building applications for specific use cases. For example, a building manager could have a monitor that tells them when to call in maintenance after a certain number of people have used the building, a more reliable metric for needing repairs as opposed to a regular time interval. Another example would be having a live update on specific websites of the number of people at a particular library, post office, or grocery store, so consumers can avoid long times and plan accordingly. A better detection procedure would be helpful; although the population counting is quick robust and accurate, it can be fooled, especially if someone is trying to intentionally deceive the detector.  A possible (but complicated) solution would be to use computer vision to identify faces, but this would defeat part of Turnstyle's purpose -- to be relatively cheap, mass-producible, and non-intrusive.  We would like to look into finding a happy medium between sensor overkill and cost.Creating alternate Turnstyles to accommodate different doors, such as sliding doors, revolving doors, or two-way doors.  You would be surprised by how many different kinds of doors are out there.

"Farmed","Harness the power of data to feed the world","[9425, 'One of our colleagues grew up on a farm in Iowa.  We wanted to see if we could mash up the USDA datasets to help existing farmers become more productive. As we undertook this challenge, we kept a few design principles in mind: keep the data local and relevant to farmers, and layer interesting data on maps to draw insightful conclusions. ', 'Our application maps your land and growth density data to identify problem spots and see how well your neighbors have taken care of their land, because you might be looking to expand your acreage. The rainfall and crop yield graphs reveal which crops performed the best in challenging precipitation years so that you can plan for dry years. ', 'We started with farmer interviews and data exploration.  We tried to see what questions actual farmers are asking that we could answer from the data provided by the USDA.  The number one issue that all of the farmers mentioned was water.  We decided to combine the USDA data with a dataset from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that contains precipitation and temperature data. Architecturally the application is built using using Javascript, Node.js, React.js, Dc.js, and the google-map API.  We use a combination of Bower, Node.js, and Gulp to test package and deploy the application.  We tried to keep the entire application client side to simplify testing and development.  We used github.com to host the source code during development.  The project is public for anyone who would like to look under the covers.Challenges We ran intoConstrained DataWe were constrained by the limited data in the datasets. For example, yield data was only available from the surveys that occur every five years. The activities data was not available in the granularity that we wanted and it is in the form of percentage of land on which each activity was performed over a year, rather than area-specific data about where herbicide was applied to specific plots of land.TimeGiven more time, we would have been able to implement visual details we had built into the planned experience using hi-fidelity wireframes that added an element of fun and polish, such as using a raindrop and leaf for the rainfall and yield graph.We would like to explore more external datasets and pull data out of them to make meaningful connections.  We would like to compare the temperature data from the existing NOAA dataset to yield data in the application.Behavior ChangeIn terms of behavior, farmers don’t have the time to create or maintain online presence, so despite what we learned about the need to share experiences more efficiently in a more targeted manner online, we would have had to tread carefully with such a solution. Additionally, many farmers initially decided to farm in order to get away from the computer. Therefore, any technological application we build has to distill the data into digestible and actionable chunks that require minimal time to analyze. Where possible, we analyze for the farmer and point out information of interest.ScopeSome of our most compelling ideas were out of scope for this project because they would have required us to use machine learning techniques to identify and recognize patterns from existing data and make recommendations for useful courses of action for the farmers. Other ideas, such as creating a social platform, would require building an active user base overnight.Accomplishments that we\'re proud ofWe reached a wide spectrum of farmers and began to really understand their workflow, motivations, and challenges.We addressed both the hackathon’s challenge and farmers’ needs:An important part of sustainability is keeping food production and distribution local. Our map-based application appeals to farmers by showing them exactly what is happening on their land and in the surrounding local community. The Farmed application helps them understand their land holistically, using history as a teaching tool, so that they can make decisions that support increased productivity.Weather is the number one challenge cited by farmers. Our application arms them with historical weather data that they can use to plan crops for projected drought years. It is flexible enough for us to add real time weather predictions for short-term planning as part of future work.The Farmed application focuses on a specific type of farmer and is designed with him in mind. We ensure that the farmer’s interaction with our application will be enjoyable and to the point.What we learnedAn Aging PopulationCurrent farmers are aging out, resulting in a loss of knowledge. The US may soon see a lack of people growing healthy food close to home. The US is losing farms at an alarming pace, and the majority of farm subsidies go to animal feed and sugar, not healthy food for people.Sharing ExperienceFarmers, especially the young ones who are just starting out, cannot easily support or learn from each other, but it’s important to them to be able to share information, new approaches, and advice on how to respond to different challenges. They need to make decisions such as when to plant and harvest, what crops grow well in their area, what works with regards to soil type and weather patterns, and how to deal with adverse conditions. Farmers primarily plan their crops by spending time researching online or they get advice by talking to other farmers at farmers markets. They would like to receive information in the moment, but people are busy, and finding the right person to talk to is all about being at the right place at the right time. One way to facilitate sharing would be to combine farm journals and weather data across people and locations. Finger to the WindWe are trying to quantify things people aren’t used to quantifying. These things usually go by gut feeling, such as gauging soil moisture. Everything is in the farmer’s head, and they make decisions based on their experience. Farmers learn from their mistakes by reviewing their farm journals. There is an opportunity to help farmers focus attention during critical times with alerts that then lead to recommended responses. We would like to add recommendations to the Farmed application in the future.SustainabilitySustainability, like the term ‘organic’, means different things to different people. To many farmers, sustainability means taking care of the land, growing the soil, and managing the farm in such a way that the farm is a closed system that sustains itself. To some, sustainability is about being able to feed the nation in an accountable way for many generations to come. To others, sustainability is about feeding the local community and maintaining a balanced personal lifestyle.What\'s next for ATS / EchoUser USDAAdd soil survey data over the vegetation density data.Add temperature data over the rainfall and yield data.Train the application to suggest varieties to grow and activities to perform based on past performance in certain conditions (e. g. what sort of nutrient level adjustments need to be made for certain soil types).Help farmers focus attention during critical times with alerts that then lead to recommended responses.Connect farmers to each other to share their experiences dealing with infestations and the weather.Connect farmers to arrange transportation to markets, and coordinate truck routes and deliveries, in order to reduce the environmental impact.A Walk Through FarmedBegin typing \'West Milford Road, Milford, NE, United States\' into the search box above the map.

"Weather Station","Weather Station to get optimize, stable, real time and true data.","[2902, ""I created this project to help people and I found my problem myself because I encountered with it. I wake up very early to go to school. At that time my family is sleeping and I don't want them to wake up. Our windows and curtains are closed at that time that's why I can't see the weather condition. I had a problem with rain and temperature last school year. In the end I want to make a Weather Station to see and get real time data and be ready for it. "", ""It gets temperature, humidity, brightness and rain situation with sensors. My Arduino 101 gets temperature, humidity and brightness. I can see these data from bright and colorful LCD. I put also inside a sensor too. With this I can feel and predict the temperature easily. With Arduino Uno I can get water sensor data and according to data, LED's will light up. If it is too heavy all of them will light up. "", ""I built it with Arduino 101 and Arduino Uno. I used LM35 for inside temperature, DHT11 for outside humidity and temperature, Grove Temperature Sensor v1.2 for outside temperature, Grove Light Sensor for brightness, Water sensor for detecting rain, BaseShield for connecting Grove sensors and also some LED's for showing Rain situation,of course some jumple wires, Grove to jumper wires and a colorful LCD. I wrote two Sketches for Arduino 101 and Arduino Uno to detect and show the stable, optimum and true data with LCD.  "", ""I have encountered many challenges. First I have to optimize and try many and many times to work LM35 and Grove Temperature sensors because their values are different so the example codes get wrong data. When I switch BaseShield working voltage to 5, problems start. Although these sensors can work with 5V but I solved with trying and anlaysing. I also had a problem with connecting water sensor to Arduino 101 with LCD because LCD sticks when sensor is connected. So I used another Arduino. At last I think this is a problem for water sensor. I bought these sensor for detect rain but these water sensor is for water level not for the rain. I will go to my village and I can't get the Rain Drop sensor that's why I had to use.

Thank you to Kroger for believing in a future that does not involve gross hands by letting us borrow one of theirs for a weekend.

The 12V buck converter provides power to a 12V DC inverter that allows us to run the Kinect from the standard AC wall adapter and charge the laptop that the C++ application runs on.

The C++ application then used this coordinate data to make decisions on the speed of both the motors, which was then sent to an Arduino over serial.  The Arduino maps this commanded speed to a usable duty cycle and sends a PWM signal to the motor controllers. ', 'Most of the challenges encountered with the project involved communicating between the computer and Arduino.  We needed to communicate over serial to the Arduino through the C++ application, and we managed to find a third party library that allowed us to send the serial data we needed.  We then had to format the data so we could 1) update the motors quickly and 2) make sure we had accurate data on the receiving end to ensure the Arduino interprets the computers commands correctly. In terms of hardware, we had no idea if the motors would even move the cart because in order to get cheap motors, you have to settle for no specifications about what you’re buying.  Thankfully that worked, and the motor controllers held up.  The Kinect has a proprietary connector that splits into data for to the computer over USB, and power to a 12V wall adapter.  We wound up taking our base 24V battery power, stepping it down to 12V through a buck converter, feeding that into a 12V car inverter that inverts it up to 110V AC, at which point the wall adapter rectifies and steps it down to 12V DC.The Kinect API also took some time to figure out, but eventually we were able to get data from it very consistently.

"OkPerk","Loyalty program powered by Kin for Instagram brands and influencers to activate their communities and increase quality engagement.  ","[5268, ""After talking to more than 80+ Instagram brands and influencers, we identified they have a serious problem when it comes to audience engagement. Sometimes their audience doesn't feel motivated to engage with their content and that could lead to lower brand visibility due to Instagram feed algorithm. The Kin tokens are game-changer that has potential to put community engagement on steroids. But Instagram brands, influencers and celebrities (ex: local salon, restaurant, fashion models, travellers etc...) are not tech-savvy to empower their community with Kin and these are the people who always crave to increase engagement ratio within their audience community for organic growth.  "", ""*OkPerk.com is an Instagram brands' and influencer's loyalty program powered by Kin, that boosts audience engagement ratio. * OkPerk Android app allows access to two types of accounts, one for the brand owners or influencers: to pick fans from the audience, manage their loyalty points and tipping them kin, managing comments and mentions. another for their fans: to claim and collect their loyalty points and Kin, manage all the brands they have engaged with.How's Kin empowering communities on our platform?Brand owners or Instagram influencers can send Kin + Ok Loyalty points to their audience who has engaged with their content through comments and mentions, even if users who don't have Kin or OkPerk account yet (OkPerk will create a virtual wallet for these users and transfer once theirs account is linked). Brands/Instagram influencers can earn Kin by inviting their audience/fans to join their loyalty program on OkPerk, through easy referral commenting. This helps OkPerk to reduce CPA and increase virality and user retention factor. Brands and Fans can sign up on our platform and earn 50 Kin :) Fans can help their favourite brands by donating back collected Kin while keeping Ok Loyalty points.

Leaderboard for Top Kin Earners for Fans highlights the most engaging and loyal fans, which opens the portal of opportunities for fans to work closely with brands and influencers they follow.     Why we believe our platform has a perfect growth factor to be next million-dollar startup?We just need to convert Instagram influencers to enable their profile for OkPerk loyalty and they are very much likely to get converted as we are solving their biggest problem of increasing engagement ratio of their audience. Once on-boarded, they do the job of promoting our platform automatically to their followers as they start rewarding their followers with Kin and loyalty points. If everything works out as we assumed, we would be able to grow exponentially in terms of userbase in no time.Secondly, our startup had earlier worked on data science in influencer and media market and had a successful exit.

"AR Voice ML Ninjutsu Battle Simulator ","Our project bridge the gap between science fiction and reality, bring anime characters to life. Users get to reenact their favourite scenes and justus from the anime Naruto with their anime figures!! ","[5174, 'Simply put, our project bridge the gap between science fiction and reality. We are a group of anime fans who dreamed of anime characters coming to real life since our childhood. In the past 3 days, we made our dreams come true. Our AR battle simulator projects hologram on our favourite anime characters to bring them to life. We achieved two main goals: projecting hologram to bring our anime protagonist to live; casting Japanese ninjutsu in hologram form through ML Hand Sign Recognition. These used to be only items that exists in anime classics such as Naruto (an anime about Japanese Ninjas) , Yugioh (an anime about a card game that can summon virtual/real monsters), but today we brought them from the 2D display to the 3D world.  A small step for 4 anime fans, a giant leap for the anime community. In addition, the anime industry is a huge untapped market in the west. According to Hollywoodreport, the revenue of the anime industry in 2017 was 19.1 billion USD. The industry is full of figure collectors that are more than willing to pay for innovative anime merchandise. Not only is our project a major breakthrough for the anime community, it is also potentially extremely profitable.  ', ""The battle simulator is a game where two players brawl off in the battle of Naruto ninjutsu hand signs. Each player has an anime figure. When ninjutsu is cast, the effect is projected on the anime figure as a hologram. The machine learning model can identify 12 unique hang signs from the anime Naruto and different anime cards. Each ninjutsu consists of multiple hand signs.

We build the machine learning model using Keras and tensorflow. We trained the model with custom dataset with 15k images gathered during the hackathon (it took a long time). At the same time, we also worked on creating a front and backend connection to host the animations and hold the game logic. We utilized flask for the backend and used react for the frontend.Challenges WE ran intoWith flask being single threaded (python in general) it was difficult for us to maintain or plan for multiple thread usages, something node would do great. However, tensorflow and keras has such a great python community that we chose to stick with it. Accomplishments that WE are proud ofWe set out a grand vision at the beginning of Hack the North to build a hologram AI battle dome. The objective was difficult and grand in nature; however, we were able to achieve it in the end. It is more than a minimum viable product, it represents the hard work and the constant trial and error during the 36 hours of Hack the North. What WE learnedWe learned to decrease the scope of the project when time and resource constraints are major issues. Machine learning, text to speech, web development, and hologram. Needless to say, we were ambitious. It is as if we are building 4 projects side by side instead of one. We learned that to achieve this grand vision, we had to decrease the scope of the project and use helpful APIs to do different components. We decreased the number of consecutive hand signs from 5 to 2; we used an API called Voice Flow to build the voice controller instead of building it from scratch. All of these discussions helped us to achieve our end goal.   What's next for AR Voice Control and ML Hand Sign Ninjutsu Battle SimulatorThe next step for the AR Voice Control and ML Hand Sign Ninjutsu Battle Simulator is to build a version of it that works for a smartphone.

"Beat The Opponent","Beat your opponents or learn from them, both way you win.","[5027, 'Amazon Alexa being a voice first interaction device/platform, and a session based (speak/listen/reply) kind of usage pattern, there are limited things you can do with it when it comes to kids. It boils down to a ""ask question, expect answer"" kind of a platform. As a developer/designer, we would innovate in how we ask the question or how we make the kids feel (using a storyline), as that is under our control . This was my thinking process while thinking of an idea for this hackathon. A very obvious choice came to mind, A QUIZ. No surprises there. But the number of trivial quiz skills in the Alexa skills store is overwhelming. A very simple guess for the low ratings of such skills is that it does not innovate in the ""ask question, expect answer"" pattern. It just blindly follows it.I thought about many other skills, and all required the use of echo show to make it \'actually\' fun to use or play. What I ended up with is  :A skill that would not ask:Only Geeky questions (boring for one and fun for the other)Only Math questions (enhance calculation skills)Only Game Of Thrones questions (make it fun for the start and boring after some time)...etc. (I think you got the point there)Moreover, I wanted to add a human touch to it so that the kids not only interact with Alexa but many others like Alexa. For example, if I am playing with an opponent (not a real one), I would not like Alexa to just tell me that this is your opponent, you will be competing with it. I would want the opponent to talk to me in some way so that I don\'t get bored with random opponent names. ', ""The skills name is 'Beat the Opponent' (Sorry for the boring name there). It is an interactive quiz game for the kids which has multiple levels and different opponent for each level. The themes are different for each level. For example, the first level's theme is on Superheroes where you will be playing against an opponent named Rick. Rick will introduce himself to you (not in Alexas voice but his own). And there will be a connection between Rick's introduction and the level's theme. So as one might expect, Rick is a superheroes fanatic, he likes to watch Marvel/DC/etc. Every level has 10 questions, and the skill keeps a count of your score (right vs wrong). At the end of the level (10 questions), it will compare your score with Ricks and tell you whether you won or not. If not, Rematch!, or Proceed to next level! Another example of a theme is 'audio-based'. In the 3rd level, you will be presented with sounds of a turkey, campfire, beating eggs, a man speaking Chinese and other cool things, for the kid to identify and pick. See I told you, not so boring after all.I don't want kids to take it as a quiz (because if they are even 1% like I was as a kid, they would hate that word, though they might have fun playing it.). Also, You would not hear a kid say to others on the playground about how a quiz is badass. THE BEST THING?Please try it on echo show and you will know it.

"", ""Sync Youtube on High is an Android app that allows users to play a single Youtube video in sync across multiple devices therefore allowing them to behave as multiple monitors for the same while also getting an extraordinary sound effect.And since we are using the trnql sdk which is based on location, the devices need not be on the same WiFi, connected via Bluetooth, or even in the same country. One can listen to music or watch videos with their family members, even when not together and still share the love. And since it uses Youtube, which is global, one doesn't even have to worry about copying the song on all devices.The app is so simple to use, that even a person with no idea of Bluetooth can use it. And if that's not enough for you, we have something for the lonely folks out there, it also suggests videos to play based on the weather and activity context signals from trnql sdk, now put this on while you are jogging, driving etc and the best song recommended for that.

"", 'It is built using the trnql Android SDK, Youtube SDK and the Android SDK. It requires no additional server thanks to clever usage of trnql SDK.

So theoretically if the devices are in different time-zones the app would work.

"Baby SmartGate","A smart baby gate that alerts you when you accidently leave it open!","[5316, 'We have an 8 month old daughter who just started to crawl so I installed a baby gate at the top of our stairs to prevent falls.  The problem is, making sure it\'s always properly closed can be difficult, especially for new parents like us.  You can forget to close it because you are in a hurry or not bother closing it because ""I\'ll just be gone for a second"".  And sometimes you think you closed it but it didn\'t latch properly.  I designed the Baby SmartGate to solve these issues and increase the safety of our home! ', 'The Baby SmartGate uses a reed switch to detect if the gate is opened or closed.  Once the gate has been opened it turns on a red LED and starts a timer.  If the gate hasn\'t been closed in the allotted time (in this case, 10 seconds) it starts a procedure to alert those nearby.  For 8 seconds it starts beeping and increases the LED brightness.  Then for another 8 seconds it further increases the LED brightness and beeping intensity.  Finally the LED starts flashing and the buzzer is at full blast.  Hopefully an adult will notice and close the gate!When the gate is closed it briefly turns on a green LED to let the parent know it is secure and then goes back to sleep.The idea is that the alerting will help ""train"" the parents to always close the gate and make it a habit.  Without an alert it would be easier to become lazy with the gate, which is often what results in accidents. ', ""The design was fairly simple.  I opened up the latching parts of the gate and found that a cylindrical reed switch fit perfectly into both sides.  The magnet part of the switch fits in the swinging gate and thus doesn't require a power source.  The other side of the switch connects to the Arduino 101 which has a rising edge interrupt setup on the pin.  I also connected an RGB LED and active buzzer for visual and auditory alerts and a button to allow me to mute the buzzer if I need the gate opened for an extended period of time.When the reed switch is closed I put the Arduino 101 (Curie) into a sleep state to conserve power.  When the switch is opened it fires the interrupt which starts my state machine to go through the various alert levels.  I also used the CurieTimerOne to create an interrupt driven PWM on the buzzer pin to simplify my beeping routines. "", 'There weren\'t many challenges with the core design but I did run into issues when trying to improve it.  First the library I used for the Curie sleep and interrupts is not ""official"" yet and has some issues.  I wanted to use PM.sleep(x) durations for my alert level timers to conserve more power but they were causing weird behavior.  Also, to eliminate the need for constantly checking the state of the switch in the state machine I tried to use normal interrupts but was having issues with detaching and reattaching the Curie sleep interrupts.I also experimented with adding the CurieBLE library to send a message to the user\'s phone when the gate was opened but the connection would always get lost when I put the Curie to sleep even though the Curie datasheet says BLE should be able to operate when the SoC is sleeping.  The firmware for Curie seems to still be in development in this area so I dropped this idea as I wanted this to be a battery powered device and needed the sleep state to work. ', ""Mainly I'm just happy that this project helped improve the safety of my home for my newborn daughter.  A recent study showed that every 5 minutes a child in the US falls down the stairs and is sent to the emergency room*.  If something like this could help prevent just one child from falling down the stairs it would be worth the incremental cost to existing baby gates. "", ""I hadn't used interrupts or state machines before in Arduino code so that was a good learning experience.  Also, I'm happy to have learned just how low Curie's power consumption is while in sleep which gives me ideas for a number of future battery driven projects. "", ""I need to do power calculations to see how long it could last on a battery as it would not be feasible to have this plugged in.  Also, I would need to find a Curie board with a smaller footprint than the Arduino 101 so I can mount it easier, preferably inside the existing gate, or the whole thing should be put in some type of enclosure for safety and aesthetics.  I'd also like to get the BLE working with the sleep states and find a cheap BLE gateway it could communicate with to connect to the internet and send text messages when the gate has been opened for too long.I'd also like to look into a simplified version of this using just a 555 CMOS timer.

"IoTyre","An Iotimated Air Pressure Monitoring Dashboard","[4601, 'We take tyres for granted, perhaps too much, but if we learn that tyres are at least part and parcel the cause of an accident in which we are involved, we suddenly become very interested.  Both from the designer’s point of view and the one servicing them, it is an excellent idea to be aware. The mission is to reduce the problems faced by the drivers because of air loss in tyres. IoTyre is an Air Pressure Monitoring system which has a sensor that is installed in the vehicle near its tyre and monitors the tyre pressure. If a pressure loss occurs in one or more tyres, the system automatically shows this as a warning in the Iotyre Dashboard. Since an incorrect tyre pressure increases the braking distance, can impair cornering and can cause tyres to heat up, this automatic monitoring is intended to increase driving safety and prevent accidents. The driver also no longer needs to perform manual air pressure checks and is informed immediately about any tyre pressure problems.   ', 'Once the user installs the sensors near the tyre of his vehicle he has to monitor the air pressure through the IoTyre  application. The sensors will check the pressure using distance formula and give the user the percentage of air pressure there in tyres.  It will compare the baseline value of the pressure which is calculated initially when the air is filled into the tyre. Then the user will get the current air pressure in the tyre in the application and if the air pressure is less than cut off value i.e. it’s too low then the user gets the SMS notification through the application that the tyre are not in the good condition and need to fill with air. After every hour sensor will send data to Amazon IOT through MTQQ protocol automatically and update the values of the air pressure in the application so that the user gets the latest air pressure of his vehicle tyre.  ', 'Set up AWS IoT data source using sample sensor data.Running the Python script generates fictitious AWS IoT messages from multiple devices. The IoT rule sends the message to Firehose for further processing. Created three Firehose delivery streams:  one to batch raw data from AWS IoT, and two to batch output device data and aggregated data from Analytics.Configured AWS IoT to receive and forward incoming data.Created an Analytics application to process data using Amazon KinesisAmazon Kinesis generates two output streams.BASIC_STREAM contains the device ID, device parameter, its value, and the time stamp from the incoming stream.AGGREGATE_STREAM aggregates the average value of distance between sensor and ground over a one-minute period from the incoming data.End result stored in S3 bucket.Amazon Lamba function calculates air pressure from data received through sensor, and posts to Dashbord using Amazon API gateway.

Proffessor Mike Filler in my school who owns a Shopping Mall also Point out that SMS text Messages seems to be a use and throw away data and thus does not store data unlike Email while some Business specialist in my vicinity  who owns Butticks, Large Supermarkets, Agriculturist etc complainsthat their customer services recieve thousands of SMS text Messages in a day and that scrolling of the phones in search of SMS,sorting of the sms text Messages and Media Files in order to be able to respond back to their customers is time consuming andsometime absolutely impossible in a high traffic SMS reception environments.Dr & Mrs. Richard Moore who owns a construction Company where I did my Industrial Training as a IT. Scientist points out that itstrue that SMS is faster than Email in terms of real time messaging but they still need to have all their SMS Messages storedsomewhere in the could as a data where they can get it anytime anyday. He also points out that the SMS Messages should be senton 1-to-1 basis(ie Peer to Peer sms text messagings) with caging process that prevent for instance  prevents User C fromhaving access to conversation that exist between UserA and User B.My Dad points out that if an SMS app could be built to meet up all the functions above,it will make the app most suitable in Ticket System because since sms is a realtime messaging protocols and the app also provides one to one SMS Chatcommunications, it will make tracking of Messages,complains, issues etc on Tickets System very easy on each Users(Customers)Uniquely.What I  Learnt from Inspiration and Interview aboveI have seen reason why many companies are using Emails as means of communication with their customers and Clients as oppossedto using SMS which provides faster realtime messages. I also learnt that:A.) Every Company, School, Organisation needs their SMS Data/information to be stored somewhere in the cloud whereit can easily  be retrieved,edit, further process or even resend. 2.) I learnt there is a need for communication contuniuty especially in Tickets System where a Customer ask or sent a complain and the issue has to be tackled my sending a follow up messages in real time.3.) I also learnt that a company can have more than 1 million customers and there is a need to have to 1-to-1 message exchange which only SMS peer to peer technology can provide.4.) Many More ......What is on my mindSMS Chat Messenger is a messaging service built on sms technology Powered by Whispir.IoThe More I looked at Whispir.Io technology, the more I think of Whispir SMS not only as way of sending just text messagesand Media files to users devices but also as a database for data storage(Eg. For Schools, Companies, Transportaions, E-commerce etc.).Thinking of it as an SMS Chat messenger. I apply the ease of mobile messengers to Whispir SMS's protocol,thereby creating a universal communication platform available to anyone with an mobile number. (as opposed to Whatsapp/FB Messenger closed networks)What I builtAn app that allows Sending,Re-sending,Tracking and Sharing of sms text messages, Multi-Media files eg Photos via Peer to peer(1-to-1) sms ProtocolsEg. between one user and another, between a company and its clients etc.How to use the app1.) Create one time registration using your mobile contact and then login.2.) Sending and Sharing of SMS Text Messages and Media Files can be accomplished in 3 ways stated below:A.) Search the user you want to sms to from the search box using her mobile number or names. once the user is populated,click on the user and navigate to the users profile to start sending sms via 1-to-1 sms chat protocol.B.) You can also send SMS by clicking on Add People Button, select the User you are looking for and start sending smsC.) You can also send SMS from your friend list.To do this you can either search the user from the search box via mobile no, names etc or click on Add People to send friend request to that user, when the user acceppts your request, He or she automatically appears in Friend list and from there you can start sending SMS and Multi-Media Files.click on Load More Button if you need to load more friends..3.)SMS Alert Components keeps track of SMS Notifications that were sent to your devices. You can reply sms messages sentto you using this option.4.) SMS History: Keeps timely Tracks of all the SMS text Messages and Files you sent to your friends, customers etc. It provides with option to edit, resend and delete already sent SMS text Messages and Files.What happen when you sent a File(Eg. Photo) to Recipients via the app.The files get sent via the SMS Chat System immediately so that the recipient can see it if he or she is online. But because its an uploaded file not just a text message, whispir does not currentlyhave a way of sending the files directly to recipient devices. So what the app do is to send the files full link to the Recipient devices via WhispirSMS. The recipient can then download the file by typing the link on a browser or by clicking on adownload button withinthe app (SMS Chat Messaging System).Integration:The App can easily be integrated into social network, businesses, Transportations, Agriculture,Schools, E-commerce, Tickets System etc.ChallengesBuilding a Peer to Peer(1 to 1) SMS Chat Technology is very hard to accomplish. combining Files Sharing with text messagesis hard as well.

Add product (4 steps -> Select category, Type or Say product name, Upload image, and Add Price)    - Here automatically our system generates tags based on the image uploaded    - For every step there is visual cues and the artisan can press a button to HEAR a voice clip explaining what to do    - Incase there is no internet the product is stored offline and sent to server later2. Accept Job offers    - Any user/buyer can push job requests through the seller app. These can be viewed, reviewed and accepted by artisans3. View nearby Artisans    - The Artisan can view any nearby artisans in a list and map view - and one tap call them for any sort of query or discussion they might want to have    - Artisan can view his own profile as well4. View Events/Melas/Fairs    - Artisans generally look to attend various fairs and events to sell their goods. A lot of Artisans miss out of the opportunity due to lack of information.     - Both a list and a map view5. View products    - Grid view of Artisans products    - Can be tapped to see detailed view of the products6. Switch languages    - With one tap the whole app can be toggled between HINDI and ENGLISH!The buyer app on the other hand, is also a unique and simple buying experience for customers (primarily wholesalers) to buy products directly from the artisans.Features include1. Search Product by IMAGE    - Upload an image and similar products will be displayed by our app2. Search Product by KEYWORD3. Search Product using Filters - Price, Quantity, etc.4. Create a Job Request    - Buyers can create job request which contains some sort of task they would want the artisan to complete    - Buyer sets the budget, approximate delivery date, description and OPTIONAL image to support the display    - On approval of any job request by any artisan - the buyer will be notified with the details of the artisan5. View artisan details    - Can view his products    - Get Directions to reach artisans    - Call Artisan6.

The user is given 2 choices in the chrome extension: apply an Adversarial Patch to his/her image or evenly distribute Adversarial Noise across the image. For the Adversarial Patch, the extension adds a patch on the image provided that causes a general object recognition classifier to misclassify an image.[2] The patch is made by applying expectation over transformation, over a random area of the image. For the Adversarial Noise, the extension makes quasi-imperceptible changes to the image such that a machine learning model classifies it incorrectly by using a single gradient ascent step, also know as a ""fast gradient sign method"".[3] While both approaches typically require a known existing neural network architecture to compute their adversarial attacks, a.k.a. a white box attack, they have been shown to work well on black box neural network architectures as well.[3] Text input is converted into an image before applying the Adversarial Attack. ', 'The first problem we faced was not being able to crop the Adversarial Patch, due to auto-croppers misclassifying the patch. We resorted to outsourcing to a human.

He died there.After studying 1 paper the night before and getting a crash course from Ming Liang, Jet (Jun Jie) faced difficulty trying to balance the requirements between adversarial machine learning code and web development fundamentals (from Bing Quan).

Blocker performs less effectively against some adversarial defenses, e.g. Robust Optimization and Certificates.[4] To overcome this, we can apply 2nd-order gradient information in our future work to generate better-performing adversaries against these defenses. One feature that we did not manage to fully implement was a Universal Adversarial Attack to pre-compute and transform the images in a O(1) constant-time operation for the adversarial step.[1] However, this comes at the expense of less robust A.I. Blocker. Other than improvements to the Adversarial Noise approach, there is also room for improvement for the Adversarial Patch approach. One such improvement can be the use of clever geometry to blend the patch into the image more seamlessly, such as an Adversarial Frame around text.

I thought that the same model could be applied to other subjects, and so I created Aristotl.Note that while the web app is primarily targeted towards students for now, it could very easily be converted to instead be a platform for technical support, or for job training questions, etc. The sky\'s the limit!

The chatbot can generally determine the subject without being told specifically what it is; ie if a user inputs ""I can\'t do this integral"" it\'ll correctly classify it as a calculus problem. After conversing with the chatbot the user is directed to upload an image of their problem, then is redirected into a private room.The ""tutor"" can then enter the private room and converse in real time with the ""student"".

"Capriccio ","A computer vision app to perform OMR on handwritten sheet music ","[3614, ""As musicians, we can empathize with the struggles of new teachers and students as they hastily switch between jotting down melodies and sounding them out on a piano. As software developers, we also recognize the powers of technology to automate tedious and repetitive tasks. To bridge those two lives together, we came up with Capriccio. OMR - What Is It?Many of you may be familiar with optical character recognition (OCR), and the many companies that compete to do it the very best. Optical music recognition (OMR) is very similar, but far less studied and with equally fascinating applications. The world of OMR is dominated by professors and post-graduate students, but by combining Kotlin, OpenCV, and a dash of ingenuity we were able to make it happen in just one weekend. How Capriccio Works(1) Sheet MusicCapriccio starts at the mobile level, where a user can either take a photo of their handwritten music directly from the app, or import it from their gallery. (2) OpenCVTaking the image, we use OpenCV to perform feature detection and clustering. We then progressively generate a MIDI file by determining the location of key musical objects and assigning them pitches. (3) MIDIFinally, we pipe our fully created MIDI file back to Android, where you can play it right in the app. The total process takes between 5-10 seconds. Challenges we ran intoOn the mobile end, we wanted to make the application target Android 10. This meant carefully navigating various privacy demands that were both scarcely documented, and completely new to our team's developers. Meanwhile on the back end, it was tough performing feature detection and filtering out noise with OpenCV. Accomplishments that we're proud ofDespite the barriers we faced, our team is proud to have created an end-to-end application with so little time. We are also proud to have had such attention to detail, even going as far as to implement complicated animations just to open a dialog in Android.

"DAI Daddy II (Uncensored)","DAI Daddy is an autonomous, open-source platform for unwinding Maker CDPs.","[5072, ""14% of Maker CDPs to date have been forcibly liquidated. When this happens, the ETH held as collateral in the CDP is automatically sold at a 3% discount to pay off the CDP holder's DAI debt, and on top of this a 13% liquidation penalty is applied.When ETH prices drop, many CDP holders can't afford to top up their CDP with ETH to prevent liquidation; but often, they don’t have enough cash to buy DAI close their CDP. So even though they may still be collateralised at over 150% (i.e. they have sufficient assets to pay back their debt), there is no way to effectively close their CDP and pay back the debt.How can we allow these users to close their CDP without paying a hefty liquidation fee? Introducing... DAI Daddy II (Uncensored) - an autonomous platform for unwinding Maker CDPs.For the product video see here.For a demo video of interacting with the dapp see here. "", 'v2.0 of the DAI Daddy platform builds on our work with $dai daddy, a CDP debt marketplace where sellers can list their CDP for sale and offer a ""discount rate"".The new version maintains this buy/sell functionality, but adds a new primary feature: unwinding CDPs. Under this model, rather than requiring a counterparty to ensure a CDP is repaid, the new DAI Daddy smart contract withdraws collateral from the CDP, uses Kyber Network to convert this ETH to DAI, and then pays off the CDP and returns the remaining ETH collateral to the owner.The number of withdraw/repay iterations required depends on the collateralisation ratio of the given CDP. The lower the ratio, the more iterations are required. Because this process follows an exponential curve, v1.0 of DAI Daddy is used as a backup option for CDPs whose collateralisation ratio is too low to leverage the unwinding process. ', 'DAI Daddy II (Uncensored) works by transferring the ownership of a MakerDAO CDP to the DaiDaddy contract which then executes the unwind process. At that point the ETH collateral in the CDP is transferred to the original owner, minus the debt owed on the CDP and any transaction fees.The value of the CDP is calculated by looking at the underlying collateral and debt associated with the CDP. These values can be found by querying the MakerDAO Single Collateral DAI (SAI) tub contract which acts as the SAI CDP engine.Using these values the total value of the CDP can be found by finding the difference between the underlying collateral and debt. DAI Daddy enables you to extract this remaining value once it pays off the CDP debt. ', 'We realised that due to the constraints of the MakerDAO smart contract system, we needed to take the user through 3 different transaction confirmations before being able to unwind their CDP. This presented a challenge from a UX perspective, but we made it as fun and non-disruptive as possible.We had some issues with optimising animations for different screen sizes, which was compounded by the fact that our front-end devs are still new to Vue.js (which we’re using to make Web3 integration easier).Smart contracts to talk to all these systems are really hard!

They might make it past spam filters, and other virus monitoring systems.

"", 'This was a fun project that started out as a good idea, and evolved into a very compelling application.  One that I would use personally and professionally.The application pattern is: ""sign up, and configure"" via a web-application interface.  As such, to build it I used my favorite web-app toolkits... MeteorJS (node, mongo, handlebars, etc)jQueryBootstrap (less)etc.And of course packages to integrate the public APIs I used:ContextIOTwilioThe publicly available repositories for Context.IO integration were a great start, but just Meteor wrappers for the excellent NPM package for Context.IO.  I chose to make another, simpler, wrapper for Meteor. zeroasterisk:contextio-simpleFor Twilio the Meteor package I used was accolver:twilio-meteor and it\'s implementation was super simple.Wiring APIs together is pretty easy, but deciding on an architecture which allows them to be coordinated and orchestrated was a bit trickier.  I eventually landed on a plugin structure, where I can add extra internal packages for each type of message scanner I want to implement, and since they have a consistent interface, stacking and running them is simple.I have the full repo available on GitHub, and I\'m happy to share privately, if you\'re interested... ', 'I thought it would be easier to get security threat dictionaries, to flesh out my threat scanners... but I have not found many.  I will be looking into finding more in the future and more importantly, setting up a partnership with a security company to get on-going updates.NodeJS is great at async queries, which do not block the main process thread and do not timeout.  Meteor mostly runs inside fibers and thus is largely synchronous on the server, within a process call.  I have run into complication trying to get Meteor to let loose and be asynchronous, which is important for long-running API request, followed by many iterative actions on each result from the API request. ', ""As a result of this project, I created a pull request to the NPM package for ContextIO to fully implement an API which is documented but missing from the package.The application itself serves as a useful tool in it's current state.  A great proof-of-concept, and a reliable security monitor, easy to setup.With a bit more effort (see the roadmap) it may evolve into a game over tool in the sysadmin's toolbelt.  Once we find a security group with the right kind of top grade security scanning to wire in... the application goes from pretty cool, to gotta have it.

"Facebook Powerchat","Supercharge your Facebook messenger.","[4772, 'Everyone spends hours on Facebook Messenger from chatting, to collaborating on work, to sending links, and to sharing photos. What if there was a way to super-charge your Facebook Messenger and make these tasks even easier and more integrated into the Facebook Messenger experience.  ', 'We implemented a bunch of new features into Facebook Messenger that will take your Facebook usage to the next level. For better collaboration we created an interactive canvas inside a chat. Users will be able to whiteboard their ideas with their friends without ever having to leave Facebook.We can stream local videos from one user to the other through Facebook allowing for instant sharing without the manual tasks of uploading it to Youtube or Drive before hand.Using the Chrome WebAudio API we have integrated voice commands into Facebook Messenger. At the tap of a button, users can speak to Facebook and have their text displayed on the screen. For those users that love the sharing aspect of Facebook, we created tools that allow you to share content much faster. Using the commands /giphy and /youtube, users can search through Giphy and Youtube for content that represents what they are feeling when words can\'t.How We built itWe attached an event listener to every element in the html hierarchy and used the react-id to get message text. From here we just associated specific message commands delimited by "" / "" to get the commands.We inserted custom css by injecting it with content scripts by reverse engineering the hierarchical and reactive structure of Facebook\'s Messenger page. This includes the canvas, the extra button functionalities, as well as anything we pushed directly into the chat.For our canvas, we used Socket.IO to create unique rooms using the Facebook IDs of users that we received from the self-referencing profile account: facebook.com/profile.php?=73322363. From here we had access to our own vanity, our user-id, as well as all of our recent chat history which we could scrape for information about other users. We went through the page to find the ids and used them to add elements to the messenger-thread.Challenges We ran intoAs we were modifying elements on Facebook\'s Messenger.com, it was difficult to see past the obfuscation created by ReactJS - it required a lot of trial-and-error testing and reverse-engineering. Sending http and websocket data within Facebook also proved difficult, as we were required to use SSL and TLS-enabled sockets, and had to deal with CORS and other cross-origin-related headers. Deploying on Azure also proved difficult originally: we experienced problem with a compiler dependency of a concurrency library for Python/Flask. We ultimately switched to an Ubuntu Box and successfully configured NGINX to handle both SSL and TLS sockets.We had an additional RESTful server deployed to Heroku. Early Sunday morning, however, several Heroku data centers experienced significant problems, preventing us from deploying: we ultimately transitioned to a VM on the Google Cloud Platform, which solved our problems.Accomplishments that I\'m proud ofWe are very proud of how much we finished because of the huge amount of obfuscation that Facebook has on their messenger page.

"PillAR","Your medication digitized","[3152, ""A couple weeks ago, a friend was hospitalized for taking Advil–she accidentally took 27 pills, which is nearly 5 times the maximum daily amount.  Apparently, when asked why, she responded that thats just what she always had done and how her parents have told her to take Advil.  The maximum Advil you are supposed to take is 6 per day, before it becomes a hazard to your stomach.  PillAR is your personal augmented reality pill/medicine tracker.It can be difficult to remember when to take your medications, especially when there are countless different restrictions for each different medicine.  For people that depend on their medication to live normally, remembering and knowing when it is okay to take their medication is a difficult challenge.  Many drugs have very specific restrictions (eg. no more than one pill every 8 hours, 3 max per day, take with food or water), which can be hard to keep track of.  PillAR helps you keep track of when you take your medicine and how much you take to keep you safe by not over or under dosing.We also saw a need for a medicine tracker due to the aging population and the number of people who have many different medications that they need to take.  According to health studies in the U.S., 23.1% of people take three or more medications in a 30 day period and 11.9% take 5 or more.   That is over 75 million U.S. citizens that could use PillAR to keep track of their numerous medicines.How we built itWe created an iOS app in Swift using ARKit. We collect data on the pill bottles from the iphone camera and passed it to the Google Vision API. From there we receive the name of drug, which our app then forwards to a Python web scraping backend that we built. This web scraper collects usage and administration information for the medications we examine, since this information is not available in any accessible api or queryable database. We then use this information in the app to keep track of pill usage and power the core functionality of the app.Accomplishments that we're proud ofThis is our first time creating an app using Apple's ARKit. We also did a lot of research to find a suitable website to scrape medication dosage information from and then had to process that information to make it easier to understand. What's next for PillARIn the future, we hope to be able to get more accurate medication information for each specific bottle (such as pill size).  We would like to improve the bottle recognition capabilities, by maybe writing our own classifiers or training a data set.  We would also like to add features like notifications to remind you of good times to take pills to keep you even healthier.Built Withapiararkitaugmented-realitybackendflaskgoogle-visioniosmobilepythonscrapingswiftTry it outgithub.comyoutu.be      Submitted to    PennApps XVIWinner                PennApps XVI Second Place Prize                  Created by  Avery LampMaking stuff is funRyan SullivanArlene SiswantoYasmeen RoumieTinder | Snapchat | NASA "", ' ', ""We created an iOS app in Swift using ARKit.

"Drugmatic","Drugmatic is an educational VR immersive experience to help teens fully understand the effects of drugs.","[4425, 'Drugs have always been a serious problem especially for the younger generation. Unfortunately, most of teenagers started their journey with drugs because of curiosity. So how might we help them get away from drugs with respect to their curiosity and imagination? What It Does""Drugmatic"" is a virtual reality drug experience focusing on teenagers. Based on research of true feelings after taking drugs, teenagers will have a taste of the illusion. During this experience, they will also have chances to make a change, and to stop this dramatic wired and fake world. Once a decision is made, there is no going back. Fantastic or horrifying, they have to go through the entire illusion by themselves. By the end of this experience, they will realize the unpredictable result of drugs.How We Built ItWe started this project by exploring the VR drawing tools Tilt Brush and Quill VR in order to draw an illusions of drugs. With this VR experience, we tried to rebuilt the scene where this event happened. Player could make their decision by themselves using leap motion.Brainstorming and Problem definitionIn order to decide the concept, we did a brain storming session. At first we thought about several ideas but in the end we made our mind to dive into a drug experience.ResearchFor us, it\'s very difficult to recreate an experience without a real reference. Thus we started our project by doing some research about what illusion would be like after taking drugs. We looked at some articles, videos and movies, decided to create the entire illusion world based on the research.StoryboardIt took us a lot of time on the storyboard. We hoped our player could enjoy the fancy part of the illusion but also the scary side. It\'s very important to let our players know that the illusion of drugs can lead you to a horrible world with the most scary result you may never have a chance to regret.Style and DesignDuring our research, we found out that there are a lot of common things of drug illusion such as higher color contrast, fluid and strange world, strange physical contact...These changes reminds us of hand-drawing. We decided to use Tilt Brush and Quill to build the world and animations. We also wanted to have some interaction for our players in the illusion world.Programming and Exporting AssetsThis is the time when everything started to become messy. We watched a lot of tutorials, tried a million times how to export our drawings into Unreal Engine, learn how to build animations...The process is bitter but it\'s also a fun journey. Challenges We Ran IntoDevelop a solution to explore the world of drug effects based on research.Integrate Tilt Brush assets into different graphics enginesLimit time and resources to create an educational experience which depends on high quality art pieces.Accomplishments that We are Proud ofSuccessfully bring Tilt Brush VR painter into the whole creation work flow.Build an incredible illusion world.InteractionNatural hand movement instead of traditional controllersCreate your own illusion by hand drawingChoose your own adventureIncorporate taste and touch into own VR experienceWhat We LearnedDrugs may make you high for a moment, but the cost of the illusion will be extremely high, too.New creation toolsTeamworkTime Management is important Some toolkits are not compatible!! What\'s Next for Drugmatic?Refine project by adding interactions and visual effectsResearch more on drug effectsPlay test among teenagersReach out schools, provide this new way for advisors and teachers.Reach out researchers and medical center, provide our project as a assistant to help people get rid of drugs.Built Withautodeskleap-motionoculusquilltilt-brushunreal-engineTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    Reality Virtually Hackathon at the MIT Media Lab Returns Year 3 January 17 - 21, 2019    Created by  Worked on integrating digital content into Unreal Engine and UE4 procedural content generation.Wentao PuWorked on the environment building and UI/UX designing for this project.Shuting JiangI worked on the interaction design and 3D modeling for the project.

We thought this was really cool, and wanted to learn how to make our own oscope demos! "", 'We created a few different applications that allow you to use the oscope in unique ways.Sound LabSound lab is a gui that lets you explore how sending different sound signals of your own design to the left and right audio channel produces different images in the oscope.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HbPvv330osDrawingDrawing extends the idea of sound lab, but lets you draw any image using your mouse and keyboard, and the image will show up on the scope.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ69lpM5Rr4PongPong lets you play pong on the oscope!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d9cI9621eUArbitrary Images (Attempted)We tried to use edge detection to get arbitrary images to display on the oscilloscope. ', 'In order to draw on an oscilliscope, you need to put the scope into ""XY"" mode. This mode takes the audio output from two channels (left and right), and plots the channels against eachother. For example, if you had a cosine wave on the x channel and a sine wave on the right channel, the oscope would display a circle.You can kind of think of the sounds being created by the laptop as parametric functions with a timestep, so with all of these projects our goal was to produce audio on the fly based on these parametizations. To make developing so many apps easy, we created a library that can take any line and produce a waveform that looks like that line on the oscope. By playing the noise for a bunch of lines in succession, you can draw any arbitrary shape.To produce these waveforms, you just take the normal line equation y=m(x-x1)+y1, and parametize it.So on the y channel your waveform would be the function y(t) = (m(x-x1)+y1) * sin(t) and on the x channel you would output x(t)=(m(x-x1)+y1) * cos(t).This library powers the Pong game, we just specified the two paddles and ball using these lines, and created waveforms that we can modulate to move them around on the screen.We also used this library for the drawing app, but with modifications. It would be way too slow to generate a sound for each pair of points in the drawings the use makes, (if we take too long to draw the screen, you can an awful flickering effect). To combat this, we used a line combining algorithm to make an approximation of the drawing entered by the user, reducing the number of points needed significantly. ', ""The oscope refresh rate is lower than we expected, so the sampling causes sharp edges when we produce square waves. This can be seen in pong when looking at the corners of the paddles, they are slightly rounded because of this effect. We also needed to run a simplification algorithm on the lines we were trying to render in the drawing app. Also, my Macs sound driver does automatic output equalization to stop your ears from being destroyed by sounds that wouldn't normally be conducive to listening to, but as a result, as the position of content on the screen changes, the oscope position drifts when my mac is used. This took us a long time to figure out, as we thought it was our softwares fault. Switching to the surface book fixed our drifting issue. Finally, the image app proved to be difficult. Edge detection is fairly straightforward, but producing a set of lines to display and scheduling them in an optimal order proved to be very difficult. We were able to get some stuff to show up on the display but it looked like scribbles.

"DECAF","Decentralized car sharing made fun","[5380, ""Car sharing services are predicted to grow more than 34% until 2024 and by then we are talking about an USD 16.5B market. We evaluated various services and not a single car sharing service today really connects to you. You enter the car, go wherever you want and get off the car. It's not fun. People are changing from ownership to usership, but these services are not as fun and immersive as they should. Volvo proposed us to find a way to gamify the car sharing service and Swisscom challenged us to create a platform that performs a digital representation of an asset as a data-bound utility token that can be used within our platform. Our solution is both DECAF and VOLT, which work together to provide the people a decentralized car-sharing platform that makes our inner gamer smile.What does it do?DECAFDecentralized car sharing made fun is an Ethereum based platform that provides car manufacturers a way to enter the car-sharing business. Manufacturers add cars to the network and receive tokens for doing so. The more cars a manufacturer adds to DECAF, the more tokens get distributed to the car maker. These tokens are then given to users based on use-time, using services for multiple days in a row, achievements and quests. DECAF tokens are, by definition, backed by cars.How can you win tokens?A user may win tokens and XP by requesting and using a certain manufacturer cars, by completing certain quests or unlocking achievements and each time you level up you win tokens. The tokens you receive can be given by more than one manufacturer, depending whose quests you completed, or by the time you used each brand's cars. There are also special quests which give XP as well as tokens.How to spend your tokens?Tokens can be spent to enhance UX. They can then be used to get discounts on the platform, free experiencies like museum visits, or discounts on an oil change. Discounts or vouchers of other services that want to partner with DECAF can also use our tokens. For example, a restaurant or a zoo might want to offer a discount for certain tokens for the exposure it will have in our platform.SocialWhen you request a car, you have the option to tell the platform where you are going. If another person is requesting a ride to go the same way, you can both accept sharing the car to devide the expense. You can see each other profiles and see their DECAF feedback, level in the game and if you have the same interests. If you are using a car with friends that use DECAF, everyone would win tokens and save money.  DECAF also makes you compete with your friends or people in the same area to get on top of the usage leaderboard. You can win extra tokens for being a regural user, making many kilometers and spening a lot of time in the service.VOLTVolvo token is how we imagine a car manufacturer implementing on top of our platform. The company will add cars to our platform that can then be requested by our users. They can also add quests and achievements to be completed by the users to improve UX by gamification and make people want to use their services over their competitors. If a user levels-up in the game, Volvo will give them tokens to award them for their fidelity by offering VOLT, the same being true if a user completes a certain special Volvo quest.This app adds fun and rewards to car sharing, making car sharing a service people will love to use.Check the Ethereum Smart Contract.   It was published to 0xbbd49bd432dc262838f7bb0ce41506c8374c2d12By developing on top of DECAF, Volvo will be the pioneer and fullfill once again their legacy of innovating and focusing on the user.How do we feel about our project?We developed a smart-contract based on Ethereum Blockchain. While we didn't accomplish all of our objectives, we learnt a lot about decentralized platforms that run smart contracts (ETH and NEO Blockchain), and HyperLedger Fabric platform, and how to develop on top of them. It was our first time building something on top of blockchain platform, so we were very happy with our progress and with what we could present in the end.   The Volvo companion app was made using web technologies to be easy to port between devices. We used HTML5, CSS and Javascript to make a user-friendly and fun web app. We aimed to build a car dashboard but time ran out on us.   We feel like, in general, we learnt, coded and had fun during the cooking of this project.What's next for DECAF?If we receive a positive feedback from Volvo and Swisscom we plan to build a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and to crowdfund this project through an ICO of DECAF.Made with <3 by ProtoTripeirosTry it outgithub.com    Created by  Developed Ethereum Smart Contract and Business ModelJoão  Cacho SáFind me at LinkedinWorked on the VOLT App, gamification strategy, and integration with the smart contractCarlosANovoVOLT companion app and integration with the smart contractFrancisco Pimenta Developed Ethereum Smart Contract and   business plan Elias FerreiraStudent of Electrical Engineering FEUPTelmo Ferreira "", ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'If we receive a positive feedback from Volvo and Swisscom we plan to build a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and to crowdfund this project through an ICO of DECAF.Made with <3 by ProtoTripeirosTry it outgithub.com    Created by  Developed Ethereum Smart Contract and Business ModelJoão  Cacho SáFind me at LinkedinWorked on the VOLT App, gamification strategy, and integration with the smart contractCarlosANovoVOLT companion app and integration with the smart contractFrancisco Pimenta Developed Ethereum Smart Contract and   business plan Elias FerreiraStudent of Electrical Engineering FEUPTelmo Ferreira ']","","False","20","['jcacho', 'carlosanovo', 'franciscofpimenta', 'eliasferreira', 'telmoferreira']","https://firefly-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/usercontent/fill/242/161/cGhvdG9zL3Byb2R1Y3Rpb24vc29mdHdhcmVfdGh1bWJuYWlsX3Bob3Rvcy8wMDAvNjA3LzI0OC9kYXRhcy9vcmlnaW5hbC5wbmc=/Decaf.png?signature=acff01a405e9455fa9450eab2ce5adddc91f0ffc","False","0"

When we saw this competition, we invited Young to join us because he heavily relies on voice to communicate to the world.Young is a part-time visually impaired massage specialist and a coder(believe it or not). When we started to brainstorm the project scope, we asked what his main challenges in his daily life are or what would really make him happy if we could use voice control system to help relieve some of his problems. At the time, he never interacted with Alexa, nor would he know its capabilities.Rachael Pai at our team is a certified Alexa Skills expert. She brought her Alexa and Echo and showed us how it interacts with us ""in English"" at the first team meeting. Oh...right, we can only speak English to make it work as of now. Then Emily Chang, YR Cheng- our UX designers started to draft the user story, recorded a few pain points on what Young faced when he conducted massage therapy with customers. For example, he often has problems with checking on the time remaining to arrange the steps of the spa accordingly during the massage session. He also would not have a way to know when the next customer will be at the door because appointment system is not in place. Sometimes, he has problem collecting the right amount of money shared with the massage store owner based on his service time and customer requests.

Young helped backend data to feed to our dashboard on http://www.iams.tw/ ', ""Massage Manager has 3 main functions: Activate a Session:  include the start of the music after confirming the pincode and notify the remaining time(a different ring tone during the session);Stop:  For music to stop or End Session: For a session to end and send the accurate end time to our database** Count Total Sessions for Each Specialists: ** for profit sharing/management purposeEstimated time spent per session is recorded at the management dashboard here:http://www.iams.tw/ so the store managers could double check if there's a conflict between the predicted session end time and the next appointment time to make proper arrangement.We also created a booking website for customers to make appointments by selecting the types of services and specialists they specified: https://siphodsalexa.wixsite.com/massagemanager/book-onlinehttps://siphodsalexa.wixsite.com/massagemanagerHere is the message manager architecture. "", 'We recruited the team from Women Who Code Taipei network:https://www.facebook.com/wwcodetaipei/posts/1211773198950381?pnref=storyEach team member has specific function and we are glad we get to resolve a real problem for one of our team members as well as his community. ', ""As most of us don't have visual problems, we spent a lot of time observing how they use the baby timer/alarm machine (https://www.google.com.tw/search?q=%E5%AF%B6%E8%B2%9D%E6%A9%9F+%E7%9B%B2%E4%BA%BA%E8%BC%94%E5%85%B7&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi54OP-l-TTAhXJppQKHZRFD4IQ_AUICigB&biw=1440&bih=710#imgrc=eA9aJf1u9TwreM:), a timer that can notify the end of a session for these specialists. But we saw they constantly need to press a button to know what's the time now and the remaining time during sessions(imagine you have essence oil on your hands), it's really disturbing to the specialist and the customer.Another thing we found out is, the idle time is long. Some specialists are available right now but they don't have a way to notify their customers or the managers can't really access their calendars to know when/how to make instant arrangements. They also could not know each other's capacity or a way to have income distributed evenly among the specialists on duty(if they want). With limited time and resource, we could only make very small MVP for this competition but it will need to address the solution we proposed to resolve Young's problem. "", ""This is the first Alexa skill created from a pure Taiwanese team focused on a topic that is very unique to Asia. A lot of visually impaired people are trained to be massage specialists in Taiwan(probably a special industry in Asian culture). From a research we found out, 38% visually impaired people have jobs, 1/4 of them are massage specialists. On average, they can serve 6 customers a day, the income in cash could be up to $200 USD/day. (The minimum monthly income/month in Taiwan is ~USD$750).Even though we could only use English to communicate with Alexa, there's potentially a big market if we could expand the services to multiple languages in various countries and it has a great value add to improve the lives of the people serving in this industry.Imagine if we could have echo in each room at multiple massage stores and customers can make appointment from their location to a nearest store with a confirmed available next agent/specialist name and accurate appointment time they enter into a store. We will resolve unemployment program and potentially make visually impaired entrepreneurs more successful.Here's the Alexa skill that has been approved for public use:https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dalexa-skills&field-keywords=massage+manager "", 'YuRongI\'ve never thought of how the intelligent personal assistant could influence our daily life until I experienced it.

"Cryptocause","Work together with others to mine bitcoin in browser and donate to charities. Cryptocurrency used for a good cause.","[4308, ""Ethan and I happened upon this idea independently through completely different means. Coming to Hack the North, I had just uninstalled a sketchy bitcoin mining virus on my computer, and I was contemplating making my own bot-net. Ethan was inspired by Stanford's Folding@Home project, which sparked ideas in him about crowdsourced computing for a good cause. When we came together as a team, we knew we wanted to apply Bitcoin technology, and this idea for a distributed computing project for charitable causes came about. "", ""Cryptocause uses WebWorkers to mine bitcoins inside of the browser without any miner install. This allows for both a more accessible way for individuals and charities to experiment with Bitcoin, but also for a larger potential pool of users contributing to the mining effort. These funds are funneled and held in Cryptocause's wallet through Coinbase, which we monitor with a Node backend to distribute a threshold of Bitcoin using Coinbase's API's to a charity selected from a database of charities with known Bitcoin addresses. Because Coinbase allows for users to receive Bitcoin without having created an address on the Bitcoin network, charities can also receive the funds by email notification, through which they can get paid directly to their bank account. "", ""The mining script uses HTTP long-polling and RPC on the server to connect to a decentralized, peer-to-peer mining pool that pays out to our Coinbase address. The script itself takes advantage of WebWorkers and multithreading to maximize the computing power we can derive from the browser. We then provided real-time analytics with Epoch, D3.js, and WebSockets connected to our Node backend to give neat insights into the hash rates of the client, the total clients connected, and the pool itself over time. Our stack is hosted on Linode, which also runs bitcoind and P2Pool to manage payouts and statistics. The Node itself is currently using Coinbase's sandbox development environment, but could easily be changed to production should our project attract enough visitors to generate a significant amount of Bitcoin.Challenges we facedOne of our primary challenges was forking Hamiyoca, which provided a starting place for being able to mine Bitcoin from the browser. Being an unmaintained repository, we had to go through the repo and fix bugs in the backend that were related to now-deprecated browser technologies (we plan on submitting a good amount of pull requests in the near future). Another challenge we faced was finding an initial mining pool that supported an older mining protocol called getblocktemplate, as we did not have the time to implement Stratum-based browser mining during the 36 hours.What's next for CryptocauseFor the future, we're planning on maximizing the efficiency of a browser-based Bitcoin miner with Chrome's Native Client in order to be able to tap into lower-level technologies like GPU shaders.

"3Degrees","iOS/Android app for burn diagnostics &amp; novel injury progression analytics using FLIR imaging","[6279, ""Burns are bad. Lots of people suffer terribly from them, and we, as a medical community - don't know that much about them. Our project seeks to address two major issues in the field of burn injuries:1) Diagnosis through Quantitative MetricsStatus quo diagnosis of burn wounds is left to the eye of the burn surgeon/dermatologist, as per the following 4 characteristics; Depth, Cause, Appearance, and Level of Pain. (Diagnostic Parameters) Of these metrics, the distinction of depth is often unclear externally, the latter two are arguably immeasurable objectively, and the last often has no standard of comparison (which complicates the entire diagnostic system). This uncertainty manifests itself in the relatively high variance of burn diagnoses for identical images in double blind studies, even amongst leading dermatologists in the field.By measuring burn depth by proxy with a newly substantiated biometric (heat, as a function of collagen denaturation), one can objectively determine the damage and full topography of the wound. 2D thermal images can be processed, and using the linear nature of heat conduction, can use 3D temperature levels to indirectly derive wound topography. Much like an iceberg, a burn only demonstrates a small amount of the wound externally, where there is extensive tissue death beneath the surface both immediately, and uniquely - experiences continued apoptosis after removal of heat stimulus. 2) Noninvasive Injury Progression TrackingCurrent widespread method of depth and wound analysis is done through invasive biopsies. Not only do these inherently disrupt the wound healing process, but they only give one unique data point per biopsy. Due to the organic/nebulous shapes of burn wounds, however, these 'guessing points' from biopsies do not nearly paint an accurate picture of the state of the entire burn. In fact, depending on where they are taken, they can improperly generalize the state of the entire wound and lead to incorrect, or at best, quasi-arbitrary dosage information.  "", 'Takes a 2D IR image as an input, creates a dynamic 3D model, computes pertinent wound properties, diagnoses burn degree, calculates post-trauma fluid requirement. ', 'Python serves as a middleman by taking a 2D orthogonal thermal image from our iOS/Android frontend input to our Mathematica script on the backend, called via the Wolfram Cloud Platform RESTful API. Image is decomposed pixel by pixel, assigning a given Z (depth) value to each coordinate in the XY plane based on the RGB color value from the original image. Points are then restructured and plotted using Wolfram 3DMap and Plot functions, smoothed to a surface of Isotherms, exported, and handed off to our front end again using Python for dynamic 3D Visualization. Further analytics are processed using Wolfram to attain values for burn degree, various other burn characteristics (surface area, volume), and estimated recovery time (note: varies significantly per person, so it\'s fairly inaccurate, but we wanted to implement the capability as the body of research attains a more accurate rate function).Minimum fluid requirement in 24 hours post-trauma (as per the Parkland Equation), is calculated, an essential treatment parameter for burn victims. ""Burned Body Area %"" is a fairly difficult value to attain for most people, so we offer a much more intuitive system that includes either estimating the wound size relative to the effected limb(s) (see: [Wallace Rule of Nines])(http://www.remm.nlm.gov/burns.htm), or even easier, a \'Draw\' option onto a vectorized body, which then automatically computes the % wound coverage by comparing altered pixels to original pixels.

"", 'Kings over Aces is a card game that\'s easy to play, but almost impossible to master.You can play it by voice on an Amazon Alexa device or app, or if you have a compatible display device, such as Echo Show or Echo Spot, you can also enjoy the game\'s visual and touch interfaces, and move seamlessly between voice and display to control the game.The game is based on a simple playing card game known as Higher or Lower,  Play Your Cards Right and other variants. Our dealer, Brian, turns over one card, ranging from Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. up to Jack, Queen and finally King. You start playing by guessing whether the next card turned over will be higher or lower than the current one.  To do this, you simply say Higher or Lower when Brian asks for your guess.If you are correct, you gain a point and you can keep playing.   You continue guessing Higher or Lower until you guess incorrectly, decide to stop (by saying Stop), or save your score if it\'s a good one.SCORINGThe game can record your Best Score, but only if you tell it to (say ""Save my Score"").  So that it\'s not too easy - saving your score also ends your current game, so to improve on it, you\'ll first have to equal it again!Other things that end your current gameGuessing incorrectly (e.g. you said Higher and the next card was not higher)  Two same-value on consecutive turns, e.g. a Four followed by another Four  Turning over a Joker.  However, this is extremely rare.It sounds easy, and just playing the game is indeed east.  But you might find building up a really good Best Score more challenging than you think.  You\'ll have to practice!\xa0Things to RememberAces are always the lowest value cards in Kings over Aces, and Kings are the highest.  Hence the name.Suits don\'t matter.  The ten of hearts and the ten of diamonds are still tens.  Don\'t get them one after the other!You can say Help at any time.  Brian (Alexa) will read some instructions, and send them to your Alexa app as well for reference.  If you have a display device, you\'ll also see a summary of commands on your screen.On your first turn, if you don\'t like the card you can change it, only once.

Soon we noticed the potential of the application, so we turned this into an automatic process that synchronizes the events with our SQL database that is accessible via a Web API on Azure.Users that login into the application have the ability to view their own planning and that of a colleague. We incorporated a functionality that gives a visual hint when consultants are allocated for the same client. This could make it easier to plan things like carpooling and meetings.Of course we know that an extra tool in the company would be something that eventually will stay unused. So we added the ability for the user to automatically synchronize their planning automatically and to receive mail notifications when their are updates made to their planning. This could be useful when you were not aware of new clients or planning updates.All these functions are also available from within Outlook via add-in integration. The Outlook Add-in enables the users to send an overview to their clients when the consultants will be present.Another advantage is: the manager or planning operator does not have to send exported Excel files to their clients. They can just add the overview of the planned days into the mail via the add-in.How we built itWe have built it with various technologies. First we started with a simple MVC application to visualize the user's planning from the external planning tool. Quickly we noticed the potential and also the problem that could occur when a lot of users will make use of this tool; the connection would be limited. So we went for another approach and we developed a Web API on Azure with a SQL database. A scheduled web job on Azure: it runs every hour and synchronizes all the data from the external planning system into our SQL database via REST end-point (Azure Web API).After the web job is done synchronizing, which typically takes about 1-2 minutes (depending on the number of people and changes), it synchronizes the planning of each individual to their Office 365 calendar; only if auto-synchronization is turned on. For adding and updating events in the Office 365 calendars, we have used the Microsoft Graph API. As we do not want to update the planning of the user each time the job runs, we added an identifier which enables us to check if it is an event created from the planning application. This enables the application to update or remove events.The interface of the application and add-in have been built by making use of the Office UI Fabric. Here is a diagram of the components:Challenges we ran intoMicrosoft Graph API and the time zone gave us a little headache. The API has changed many times before it went GA and there were a couple of drastic changes to the date format of adding or updating events.Accomplishments that we are proud ofThese external planning tools are difficult to work with if you do not know everything about them. In this respect, we are very proud that we now have an application which enable our colleagues to just use the tools they know which is Outlook and a website.What we learnedWe have learned a lot during the creation process of the application. We have tried to use new technologies such as the Microsoft Graph, Office UI Fabric, Azure Web Jobs, Azure Web API.What is next for the Online Planning SystemWe are now trying to find a way in order to make planning changes in our application.

"EverGreen","A developer tool to analyze and reduce the carbon emissions of code","[3159, 'One of the most pressing societal issues right now is the environment impact of CO2 emissions. Companies and organizations around the world have made huge efforts in an attempt to avoid environmental disaster. The field of Computer Science often overlooks these issues because from the outside, it seems programming would not have a negative impact on our planet’s health.  However, it is important that we be aware of the part we play and know how we can help by improving the way we code.What it DoesEverGreen is an eco-aware IDE. Given an expected amount of traffic and set of computer specs, EverGreen is able to capture the environmental impact that a programmer\'s code will have by using various metrics such as the carbon emitted in the average lifespan of a car. Since many of today\'s large computations are done on the cloud, we have provided users with various industry standard AWS instance type based architectures.How We Built itCALCULATING APPROXIMATE CO2 EMISSIONSAfter reading through several papers and articles we formulated a means of calculating the CO2 emissions. Following the results of this paper, we used the following equations to calculate the CO2 emissions for a given piece of code:https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02243We then needed to generalize the emissions for other hardware. This was done by using profiling and static analysis to extrapolate and approximate the CO2 emissions for other architectures.SUGGESTING CODE IMPROVEMENTSWe used a Context-Free Grammar to map various commonly written code with lines that produce less CO2 emissions. Additionally, we made it such that we can easily create more rules in the future.Challenges We Ran IntoOne of the most difficult aspects of the project was to suggest improvements for inefficient code. Initially, we attempted a ""find and replace"" solution, but we quickly saw flaws in attempting to make our code flexible. Our solution was to use grammars in order to figure out a seemless way to create additional performance suggestions.Accomplishments That We\'re Proud OfA primary goal of ours was to evoke emotion about environmental impact, and we are really proud of the graphics we created to do so. Using hand drawn graphics, we created animations that give an impactful visual representation of the enviornmental influence of the user\'s code.What We LearnedWe spent a significant amount of time learning different ways to analyze our code. We learned to use RAPL and profiling to measure the power consumption of our local machines and static analysis to suggest code to the user.What\'s Next For EverGreenWe hope to improve our grammar to suggest more efficient python code. Additionally, we would like to add support for multiple languages to help all programmers be more environmentally conscious about their code.Built WithflaskmaterialuipythonraplreactTry it outgithub.comgithub.com      Submitted to    SD Hacks 2019Winner                1st Place                  Created by  Matthew Krageral-fred-oAlice Chi ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['python', 'flask', 'react', 'rapl', 'materialui']","True","14","['themkrage', 'al-fred-o', 'alicechi2']","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/872/502/datas/small.jpg","False","3"

"E.A.T. UX Challenge","To create a humanizing experience that empowers families to successfully apply for free or discounted school meals.","[5377, ""Inspired by the opportunity for broad social impact, a Chaotic Moon design team carved out some spare time and answered the call -- interviewing, prototyping, testing, writing, illustrating, iterating, and coding their way to a simple, intuitive, forward-thinking online application template.    Our Design ProcessPrior to starting this project, we defined three principles to help guide our design process: Empowerment, Humanization, and Relevance. Empowerment: Provide parents with the ability to complete the application with confidence.Humanization: Design an experience that respects a parent’s situation using language that is empathetic and easy to understand.Relevance: Provide parents with appropriate and relevant instruction to increase understanding and accuracy.We experimented with an aggressive, iterative approach: 1.5 weeks of concepting and 1.5 weeks to test and refine the application. We began by conducting high-level research to define the project, followed by in-depth discussions with school administrators, volunteers, and parents during our design phase. While we would have preferred to do the bulk of the research up front, time constraints and busy schedules made it impossible to do so. Therefore, we had to make a lot of assumptions before strengthening our concept with research findings in the second iteration. In regards to visual design, we created mood boards to establish the tone and mood of the interface during the beginning of the project. After we solidified our final concept, our visual designers quickly began work on a design language and illustrations. We focused on creating a design that was friendly and approachable for the user.ChallengesHaving 12 team members on any project requires coordination, especially when 7 of those members are UX designers! Going into the project, we did not establish a hierarchy for roles or assign one person to oversee the direction of the design. However, due to our commitment and passion, we collaborated very well and natural roles emerged. In the end, every single team member can claim ownership of at least one deliverable.This project would have been much easier if the goal was to simply create a digital version of the existing paper application. However, in tackling this project, we wanted to create a better, more human experience for individuals filling out the application. This required a much more in-depth understanding of where people are struggling with the application and more importantly, why. Understanding the why allowed us to make design decisions that are geared towards addressing the root cause of the issue.

"", 'Delegating work between teammates made the work less intensive on each of us and allowed us to specialize in aspects we excel at. Teamwork makes the dream work! ', 'We plan on improving the web application with the help of our Computer Science department at Washington and Lee University, introducing it to food banks in Lexington, VA, such as Campus Kitchen, as well as restaurants. We hope our application will have a positive impact.49 million Americans are living in food insecurity while 70 billion pounds of food goes to waste annually in the United States. GrubShare is an all-in-one platform for connecting food banks to restaurants and grocers with excess food. Donors simply indicate the quantity and value of their excess food and volunteers and employees of food banks are notified. Then, site provides a fastest-calculated route to pick up a series of donations in a timely fashion. The program automatically tracks donations and provides up-to-date tax-deductible savings for businesses who are able to save 25% on otherwise sunk costs—while simultaneously feeding hungry people. Food banks reduce costs, increase their ability to server a larger market, and require less staff to coordinate an otherwise labor intensive process.Donors save thousands of dollars. Food banks increase impact. And GrubShare solves food insecurity, one meal at a time.Advantages- Our advantage is simple: no other platform is more user friendly, takes less than 20 seconds to make a donation, or integrates the power of ArcGIS map technology to make the fastest, most efficient routes possible.The Technical Side-There are two primary users for GrubShare: Food Banks and Food Providers (i.e. restaurants, grocers, and stores with excess food that would otherwise be discarded). New users register accounts and then have access to a series of primary functions:Food Providers: On any given day, if a Food Provider has excess food, they may submit a form to indicate the quantity and value of their intended donation. They will receive an automatic notification of when the food will be picked up. Food Providers’ accounts will also have a running total of meals provided and dollars saved via tax deductible donations. In order to encourage frequent donations, the home page of the site will eventually provide statistics on top-donors.Food Banks: Having selected a specific service region, Food Banks receive donation notifications from Food Providers in that area. Registered Food Banks may log in to their account to see a series of pins on a map of their region to see the donations of that day. Based on potentially limited resources, Food Banks select the donation sites they will be able to visit. Then, using ArcGIS map technology, they receive the fastest-possible route between locations, automatically notifying Food Providers of their estimated arrival times. Additionally, there are plans to implement a ranking system to note the quality and reliability of donations from Food Providers. Food Banks may choose to decline offers from Food Suppliers who frequently have expired or inedible donations.GrubShare seeks to tackle one of the most prominent social problems of the 21st century by providing cutting edge technology to the non-profit sector. Reduce waste and feed the hungry by sharing grub with GrubShare.

Additionally, there are dozens of services to display your raw health data using fancy graphics and sophisticated animations. But why don’t you use them?In a classical Finnish sauna business meeting, we figured out that the way to help you with your health is not to show you even more diagrams, bar charts and tables but to keep it simple (, stupid). That is why we came up with Ges::ndheit.Well, let us introduce Ges::ndheit: ', 'Ges::ndheit is the solution for all of your health problems. It’s the swiss army knife of the personal assistant apps. It is the last ray of sun before the cold night (which is like 4pm in Finland).Ges::ndheit solves the information overload of all those smart devices you own by reducing all of the available data into one clear personalized instruction on how you can improve your health. Those instructions vary from simple text-based recommendations up to adjustments of your SmartHome devices. The personalized instructions are constructed by a recommendation algorithm that combines your health and context data with research, cohort and health consultant data. The impact of the recommendation algorithm can be leveraged further by any data about you and your environment.  ', ""As a team of five developers we split work into three main areas: Backend, iOS App & Design.BackendOur backend team was mainly focused on getting as much information as possible from various data sources (OURA, Isaacus, Kanta, Localtapiola, Tieto & ISS, Apple HealthKit and many more). This information was highly heterogenous, thus we had to clean, restructure and combine it before we could use it in our classification algorithm.This algorithm had to be developed as well. It is responsible for detecting the benchmarks for a good health that we could compare the user's data to. The algorithm uses clustering to detect cohorts of similar people.To get access to those values, a REST-API was created as well.AppFollowing our idea of simplifying the large amounts of daily health data, our app reduces distraction by using a simplistic design. It lets you concentrate on living a healthy life. All you have to do to live a healthier life is to allow Ges::ndheit access to HealthKit and (optionally) Kanta. The app then automatically fetches your data and compares it with other patients’ data in our backend to generate a personalized instruction just for you.Performance-wise the whole app is 100% pure Swift in order to run as fast as possible. "", 'There were a lot of technical difficulties in making the data look pretty, so it is comparable and clusterable. Mistakes in some datasets (e.g. 500kg+ body weight) made it even more difficult for us, as we had to clean the data using outlier detection.Another challenge was that some of the IOT devices we wanted to use were either not provided (e.g. the Nest thermostat) or already taken (e.g. the Amazon Echo). The former could be solved by creating a Nest Thermostat Simulator which is now accessed by our API instead of the real technical device. ', 'Our team worked very well, as everybody had distinct expertises that combined covered the whole range from Design, over Frontend, Apps, and Backend to Machine Learning.As mentioned above, the backend team worked hard on the implementation of an algorithm to find groups of user types and to match you in one of those to find reference values.

We saw the power of the media firsthand, as journalists published article after article in a deluge of political news, rhetoric and prediction, a chaotic echo chamber that did no one any good. We want to raise the standard of journalistic integrity, and remind everyone of how easily we can be biased and swayed. That inspired us to build Ethos, an automated tool that analyses the words we consume. It’s easy for humans to be unobjective, and so we hope that the unbiased rationality of computers can be brought in to counter our inherently tinted lenses. ', 'Ethos is a Chrome extension created to analyze articles for their level of objectivity or bias using natural language processing elements from the IBM Watson API. Additionally, data is searched and compiled from previous articles written by the same author in order to deliver a general report on the author’s bias, openness to different perspectives, and topics of focus. User-interactivity was incorporated through a Facebook scraper that analyzes articles at real-time while scrolling through a news feed. ', 'There are two main parts to the project, the client-side Chrome extension, and the Flask API server it contacts. The Chrome extension was written largely in HTML/CSS/JS, doing client-side retrieval of document analysis via the IBM AlchemyLanugage API for low-latency display of data e.g. in the facebook feed. For more involved data processing, the Chrome Extension made AJAX requests to a Flask server hosted on Heroku. The Flask server was responsible for processing authors, aggregating their works, doing personality analysis and incorporating feedback. Authors were extracted via the AlchemyLanguage API and we used the AlchemyDataNews API to search for their past writing, before judging their overall objectivity. To avoid excessive API calls, authors and articles were cached on server in a Postgres database. We used the IBM Watson Personality Insights API to evaluate author personalities for added insight, while accumulating the various taxonomies of an author’s body of work to assess how knowledgeable and familiar they were with a specific area. We also used the Diffbot API to detect if a page contained an article. ', 'The main challenge during this project was manipulating the raw data from the Watson API and displaying it in a user-friendly form. We spent a considerable amount of time trying to represent the intangibility of bias and objectivity in a succinct but also intuitive way, finally settling on a series of elegant bars. Another problem was the detection of articles and the absence of author data, which we detected by running test cases and solved by dispatch bulletproofing. ', 'We’re proud of the fact that we were able to pool together our respective skills and develop a product that could potentially bring around change regarding an issue that we all felt strongly about. From dealing with minor issues by consulting each other and friends, waiting through long lines to grab food and snacks, to overcoming huge project workflow hurdles by chalkboarding out large diagrams, we’re proud to say that the project—and us—all came together at the end.

"CodeClimbers","Tired of grinding Leetcode alone? Make interview prep more fun with CodeClimbers, a social &amp; educational coding game!","[6570, ""The Origin Story: We had all been anticipating HackUCI and wondering what we were going to make. Then one night at Albert's house, the inspiration came. We were all practicing LeetCode questions together by mock interviewing each other and discussion solutions. Albert had half of a solution to a LeetCode question left on a whiteboard, and I jokingly told Jeff to hurry and try to finish Albert's code before he came back. Leon immediately thought it was a great idea for us to try and implement it for HackUCI. And then the dream was born...The inspiration for the application itself comes from the educational value of LeetCode, and the ease of collaborating with friends through applications like Google Docs. There are not enough interactive coding environments available, especially to beginner programmers learning how to code through pair programming. Another issue that comes up with pair programming that we have all experienced is that two different people may not be used to typing with the other person's laptop/computer, so CodeClimbers allows for pair programming with the comfort of your own keyboard. CodeClimbers is a solution that is fun, social, and educational! Why is it called CodeClimbers?: The name CodeClimbers comes from the fact that learning how to code and become a LeetCode pro is a climb. We believe that every time we choose to team up with friends to make studying more fun, we make the climb just a little bit easier! We're all in this together! "", 'CodeClimbers allows a user to team up with a friend to solve common programming questions. Users have the option to create a room or join a room using a code! It allows for two users to be in the same coding room and type in the same editor. The catch is, only one user can type in the editor at a time. This ensures that each user gets a turn at typing and prevents one user from overpowering another user (like what can happen in a normal pair programming situation). The timer is displayed on screen that signals when the switch is about to happen. Also on screen is whose turn it is. During the experience, the users can both run the code and see the output or error messages (using the run button). When they believe that their solution works, they may submit their code (using the submit button), and their code will be sent through a few hidden test cases before sending the users some feedback on how they did!Be sure to check out the demo on Youtube! Demo Here ', 'We built the client side of our project using Vue.js and Firebase. Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications and Firebase is a web-application (and mobile-application) development platform that we used to store our data in a real-time environment. The real-time database was key to allowing multiple users type in the editor at the same time. Vue.js was used to write all of the different components of the page- the editor, timer, header, question-box, etc. We built the server side of our project using Express.js, Node.js, and judge0. Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs. We used Express to be able to make requests to the API judge0, to compile Python code we posted and get back submission details.  ', 'We ran into a few challenges through the course of HackUCI. These involved, issues with handling asynchronous requests with the server and learning how to work with Firebase (connecting and working with a Real-Time Database!). In the beginning, these issues were a bit discouraging, but we powered through and were able to get it together! Two members of the team had little to no experience with Javascript at the beginning of Hack, so we had to learn fast.  ', ""We are all very proud of the product we were able to push out during HackUCI. This is the first big project that we have worked on as a team. We're proud that we were able to stay motivated and push through. Before we started the project, we weren't sure how we were going to do it because we had never worked with many of the technologies. However, that didn't stop us from successfully implementing a lot of our project's core functionalities.  "", 'We learned how to use Firebase and work with a Real-Time Database, some of us learned Javascript for the first time, most of us learned Vue.js for the first time as well. We learned how to deal with asynchronous requests, communicate with a database, and connect a working client to a working server! This project was more complicated than any project that we have ever had to do for school, so we had to learn how to manage our time effectively and self-teach on a lot of topics! Most importantly, we learned that we all work really well as a team!  ', ""There is always room to grow! CodeClimbers hopes to eventually expand our program to allow for more coding languages. We also wish to implement a leaderboard so teams can see how they did compared to other. The design of the web application can always be improved as well to be more user friendly and intuitive. We are always striving to be better. Another feature that we hope to add in the future is a chat box so users don't need to be side by side to communicate while coding!

Subtitle text size is dictated based off distance which would not be possible without ARKit.CoreML 2CoreML2 was mostly used for its computer vision application. HEAR uses facial recognition to detect potential speakers and to position subtitles in the right position. This is achieved efficiently by utilizing the Vision API.SiriKitSpeech to text is the most important feature of HEAR and for that reason, the SiriKit was chosen to transcribe speech from speakers to subtitles. Having Siri perform some computations and natural language processing locally helps speedup the transcription which leads to a better user experience.SpriteKitHEAR uses SpriteKit to overlay the subtitles in a 3D environment. SpriteKit also allows text customization to make the text clearer and more legible on varying backgrounds.ChallengesAs none of the members were familiar with Swift or iOS development, creating the HEAR iOS application and utilizing advanced technologies was both challenging and exciting. While the learning curve was steep, working together through paired programming helped us work through problems efficiently as well as ease the transition of learning a completely new environment.Technically, we ran into trouble using SpriteKit and ARKit, as most tutorials and documentation required the user to touch where they wanted to place an object. We wanted our object placed based off of the decision made from the facial recognition software we created.

"Twine Health Activation Platform","Empowers patients to achieve maximum self-efficacy in their health through continuous collaboration with care teams.","[7914, 'I left practicing medicine 10 years ago because of significant disappointment in the ability of the healthcare system to support patients between visits and to embrace their contribution as part of the team. I was inspired to push the limits of patient participation and to build technology to facilitate dramatically better care. ', ""Health Activation is the process of empowering patients to break free from the typical reactive healthcare experience and to become proactive in taking control of their health.The Twine Health Activation Platform is a cloud-based SaaS offering that runs as an app (iOS and Android) and in the browser (Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) for patients and their care team members. It synchronizes with Apple HealthKit and Google FIt, and therefore leverages a wide variety of connected devices (glucometers, blood pressure cuffs, pedometers, etc.) and apps (MyFitnessPal, LoseIt, etc.)Twine empowers patients to co-create action plans and goals with members of their care team through shared decision making. These action plans are automatically synchronized to the patient's devices (phones, tablets, computers, etc.) and provide timely reminders and learning opportunities through the course of the day to help support the patient in successfully achieving goals. Streamlined communication tools including secure text (with attachments, photos, videos, etc.) and video calls allow patients to get support from the care team right at the moments that they need it. Powerful analytics including artificial intelligence on the care team dashboard allow the quick identification of patients in need so that the right care can be delivered to the right person at the right time. A powerful new class of cohort-based intervention analytics leveraging daily patient self-report data give the care team real-time insight into effectiveness of each care team member and into interventions at large. "", 'Our core team spend 6 years at the MIT Media Lab researching health activation and building a predecessor platform called CollaboRhythm. We built what was likely the first healthcare app on a smartphone in 2006 and have continued to push the limits of patient participation since then. We used this experience to begin building Twine in 2014. We have worked with thousands of patients and over 70 healthcare organizations/practices in refining its functionality and impact on the experience, outcomes, and cost of care.The Twine platform consists of two major components. A client application (the TwineClient) that is implemented as an HTML5 single-page application using the AngularJS framework. The TwineClient is available as both a web application and well as a native mobile application (packaged with the Cordova framework) for iOS and Android. A server application exposing a RESTFul API (the TwineServer) is implemented with NodeJS leveraging MongoDB as the database. The TwineClient and TwineServer are both hosted on Amazon Web Services.Accomplishments that we are proud ofOur team has published the largest impact hypertension (26mmHg drop in blood pressure in 3 months) and diabetes (3.2 drop in HbA1c in 3 months) in the world by a significant margin. This work was done with the Massachusetts General Hospital (https://www.twinehealth.com/hypertension-rct) and the Joslin Diabetes Center (https://www.twinehealth.com/diabetes-study), respectively, and also demonstrated significant cost reductions and improvements in patient satisfaction.We have reproduced these results consistently with other organizations, and we expect to report on similar outcomes in hypercholesterolemia, COPD, asthma, CHF, etc. as we have partners leveraging Twine across dozens of different condition / wellness interventions.We have demonstrated that Twine can produce a 3x increase in health coach (a particular type of care team member) panel size and a 66% reduction in all cause office visits in parallel with the outcome improvements listed above. This degree of scalability has the opportunity to profoundly affect healthcare costs. ', ""The biggest challenge for Twine has been that the majority of healthcare is paid for under fee-for-service mechanisms and thrives when outcomes are poor and costs are high. Most Accountable Care Organizations do not have nearly enough risk in their portfolio of payment contracts to justify improvements in primary care - only in 90 day hospital readmissions, certain bundled payments, and other glancing blows at healthcare outcome deficiencies and cost problems. We know this because we succeeded in dramatically improving hypertension and diabetes outcomes with several ACOs only to be told that they did not want to the interventions because the outcomes decreased revenue (fewer office visits, fewer referrals, fewer ER visits, fewer hospitalizations, etc.).What we learnedWe have learned a great deal over the past 10 years about the learning science and health psychology of patient behavior change and how to build technology that maximizes collaboration between patients and care teams.We have also learned that the market of workplace health is an incredibly exciting space for innovation in primary care. Self-insured employers have a tremendous desire to improve the experience of healthcare and to decrease costs because they are directly responsible for the healthcare bill for their employers. Many are contracting with providers directly to build primary care practices on premise and are experiencing 20-40% decreases in total cost of care with the dramatically improved care that can be delivered outside of fee-for-service medicine. Others are contracting with near-site practices or adopting biometric screening and health coaching programs.Even health systems are deploying new models of care for their own employees as an opportunity to learn to deliver value-based primary care. They want to lower their own healthcare cost and improve employee health, but they also want to build competencies for when their mainstream value-based care contracts cross the risk threshold that they will need to leverage the same models for all of the lives covered.Twine now works with a variety of workplace health vendors and employee health programs at health systems and our business is focused on expanding in this market.What's next for Twine Health Activation PlatformOur team is currently working on a number of exciting enhancements to the platform that we believe are going to dramatically enhance the experience for patients and the scalability of care teams. In the coming weeks, we will release a patient self-directed experience in Twine that allows people to get started setting and achieving goals even before a health coach or care team is available. Then we will augment this experience with the ability for patients to add family members, friends, and peers and to work with multiple care teams simultaneously.

"DZ - Context News Bot","Solving the misinformation problem in the information age with Machine Learning","[4141, ""Social media algorithms are built for engagement & likes, not perspective, and we aim to fix that with Context News Bot.We’ve all been in never-ending arguments with friends and family on critical issues like politics, international events or religion in the past. In recent years, however, we see a trend in people blindly trusting ‘facts’ they learnt from a video they saw last morning on WhatsApp or tweets by an influential person. This epidemic is especially prominent in people who grew up before the information age of computers and have never had to question the credibility of news sources in the past.The ProblemThe inability of people to create an internal filter against their own bias has caused the proliferation of false (or somewhat false) information to plague modern society and is slowly leading us to a world with only polarizing opinions. Today's modern discovery algorithms trap us in our ‘filter bubbles' by giving us content that agrees with our inherent biases regardless of whether these biases are grounded in reality. "", 'We built a Machine Learning based web API that allows users to fact-check any content on social media and gain a broader perspective on news items and events. The service helps get rid of inherent biases by understanding the semantics of content and suggesting related news articles and Wikipedia entries that aim to give an objective and global perspective. Our Natural Language Processing pipeline performs entity and topic extraction from tweets to search for news articles from reliable sources and discover Wikipedia articles. We combine this information with sentiment analysis signals for the tweet as well as the news articles to select articles which have a different perspective from the tweet.Our service was seamlessly integrated into Twitter’s user interface to build an intuitive proof of concept. ', ""The tech stack consists of a Chrome extension (to scrape the tweet and add the context panel), a Flask server that communicates with the Twitter API, a news search API & a custom Natural Language Processing pipeline built on top of the Google Cloud API. We calculate the final ‘scores’ for the news articles based on our own heuristic-based feature engineering combined with deep neural networks from Google’s API.User ExperienceWe embedded our service into the Twitter UI as a button which was designed to blend into Twitter’s UI and be intuitive to use for a regular user. Upon clicking the CNB button, beautiful and informative news cards will drop down under the selected tweet, showing relevant news articles and Wikipedia entries, along with a polarity meter to show agreement/disagreement with the tweet.

"myNursebot","Track your symptoms, medications, readings and appointments just using your voice.","[6888, ""myNursebot was born out of need to take care of my mom who despises tracking medications or readings on any screen be it a smartphone or a tablet. She is 76 years old and has high blood pressure for quite some time. Last year, she was rushed to hospital in an emergency because of very high blood pressure. The cause was non compliance with medication as well as not having the ability to log symptoms on a regular basis. Had she taken medications regularly, the emergency visit could have been prevented. Also she did not know that her medications had side effects like nausea, leg pain or state of confusion. Had she known this, she could have consulted the doctor earlier to get different medications that do not have these side effects. Wouldn't it be nice, if there was a way to log the health data at the whim of a verbal command? It is much easier than picking up the device, opening the app or just write it down with old school paper and pen. Our quest began in mid 2016. We searched for easier solutions. We could not find any voice enabled app that could do the job so we thought we will build one. My wife and I tested the feel of Amazon Alexa with our parents. They liked it. We surveyed a group of friends, who had similar issues of logging symptoms and medications.  Having a strong background in software and passion for solving real world problems specifically in the area of health, we decided to build a voice skill. "", 'myNursebot logs health data through voice and generates a health summary.It captures body vitals, symptoms, medications and appointments just by user’s voice. No screen is required. myNursebot also emails health summary whenever the user asks it. The user can choose to share the summary with doctor at next visit for a better treatment plan or can share it with loved ones. By logging the symptoms regularly patients can provide a detailed history to the doctor rather than relying on memory that could be unreliable.  ', 'We started with the product definition. In this phase, we defined what will be the feature set and what is the minimal viable product (MVP) to showcase it to our user community and test the waters. After defining the feature set, we started on two parallel paths - Interaction Model to be developed by Product Management Team and Engineering team to layout the architecture.On the architecture side, we discussed different tool sets and a heated debate on Java vs. PHP continued for couple of weeks. We knew that we need to have a response time of less than 100ms for the voice application to functional normally. Our architecture team finally chose to build the server side in PHP. Because alexa did not support the SDK in php we wrote one.On the product management side, the team wrote the interaction model. They tested different models before finalizing on one as Alexa has its own nuances in which voice interface is implemented.Once an interaction model of a particular product feature was stable, the engineers started implementing it. Testing - We went through normal cycles of testing (feature tests, regression testing, negative testing etc). It took quite some time to foolproof the application specially when users aborted the current context or spoke out of turn. ', 'Interaction Model Challenges - Interaction model defines how voice utterances are to be recognized, interpreted and converted to data (text) that is meaningful to the app. For example, if the user says “Add my blood pressure reading of 120 over 80” will convert to reading_type = “blood pressure”, Systolic BP = 120 and Diastolic BP = 80.Reduce the number of utterances - Alexa only allows 200,000 characters in defining utterances. We worked many iterations to reduce the number of utterances yet keep the quality of the applicationFool proofing the interaction model - With voice interface, user can choose to speak anything they want to. For example, if the app asks, what is your glucose and the user says 1:30PM, the app needs to react in the right way. Either record the glucose as 130 or ask it again. It was quite a challenge for the product management team to foolproof the voice app.Architecture Challenges - We aimed to have an application response time sub 100 ms.Java vs. PHP - Our engineering team debated for more than 3 weeks, built prototypes and finally concluded to go with PHP as it performed better than JavaRules System - myNursebot requires a rules engine that can execute decision trees. It took many weeks to select a rules engine that can deliver responses sub-30ms. The rules execution included querying database in real time. ', 'We are seeing good traction from the user community and the health provider community. Couple of reviews worth mentioning are“Instead of relying on a single read of vital signs in clinic, I have access to a temporal log of vital signs that makes my decisions sound.”“My grandpa measures blood pressure 3 times a day. Mynursebot makes it easier to log the details hands free and create a quick summary to show to the doctor.”We have seen new user signups of more than 75 on a single day and people are buying into the vision of myNursebot. We are proud of the agility of our team team who was able to release the product in less than 5 months from conceptualizing to a stable product.  ', 'Building Voice User Interfaces (VUI) requires a different mindset than building Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). The product design, implementation and testing  is totally different for a VUI based application. Natural Language Processing (NLP) being quite new is going through major development and refinement cycles. This slows application developers like us quite a bit. Alexa and Google Home platforms are quite different when it comes to application definition as their architectures are different. They require VUI tailored to their platform. It is just like developing a native mobile app for iOS, Android and Microsoft platforms and each require a different skill set. ', 'Being in stealth mode, we cannot reveal our upcoming features, however our vision is to provide a health companion with whom patients can talk to and get the necessary actionable information. myNursebot will strengthen the AI algorithms to have a pro-active interaction with the patients and strives to be a market leader in its category.

This can include our plants, that have need not only for water, but also sunlight (in different intensities). We could create a habit to water the plants at a certain time, but is it really necessary? What if you shouldn't water the plant today, because the soil is already moist or because it will rain within one hour? "", ""CoolPlant uses 4 sensors - soil moisture, air temperature, air humidity and light - to determine plant's current state, check these values against the optimal values for the plant's species, and if some action is necessary, such as the soil is dry so the user needs to water the plant, the app sends an e-mail to the user or users themselves can check the plant's current status on CoolPlant mobile app, that summarizes how the plant is doing.When the app sends notification for the user to take an action, it also checks for precipitation, so users can decide whether water or not their gardens.This app can also be extended to work in groups and cover a bigger area (e.g. a farm or community) making the benefits of saving water much broader. "", 'I used the ESP32 board to connect the sensors, since it supports (partially) Arduino, has built-in wifi, can be powered by battery and is cheap. The device sends data in JSON format to Amazon IOT, that receives it and forwards to Amazon Kinesis. I used Kinesis Firehose delivery streams to buffer this incoming data and save it periodically to an S3 bucket. Every time an S3 object is changed, an S3 event is fired and I could attach a AWS Lambda function to respond to it, sending an e-mail. In other words, every time CoolPlant has a good amount of data to process, a custom Java function is called, reflecting the scenario: ""the plant is communicating and I should check expected/actual data and maybe take an action"".I also created an Android App to allow users to check up-to-date sensor data and weather conditions. For this kind of ""consumer"" (mobile app, web apps, third-parties, etc) I created an API using API Gateway by simply using another Java Lambda function I created with the goal of returning plant\'s current status.The Core of the CoolPlant also uses a Weather API (wunderground) to give additional advice to the user.

"Math Jam","Educational Battle Royale!","[5021, ""Our inspiration to make this web app / game came from the simple dominance of battle royale games. The most popular games played today are of the battle royale genre and we wanted to expand the genre to cover a wider spectrum, such as educational games, to make them more appealing for kids who should not have to be bored or reluctant to learn because of some dull educational tool.The GistIn a nut shell, this application is a multiplayer game that one is able to play with as many people as they wish. The player(s) enter in their desired in game name and are taken to the main game page where their computer screen is filled with a variety of different features and aspects of the game. The game begins when one of the players decides to press the start button of course. The gameplay is parallel across every player in the sense that each player receives random and different sets of questions that are not codependent. The only shared state between the players of the same match / lobby is whether each player is 'alive' or not. The players must answer one of three questions of each question set that include easy, medium, and hard questions. If one gets a question right, they gain points and will see their point / progress bar increase. In addition, as common to all royale games, there is an ever enclosing 'circle' that is represented by another progress bar which increases over time and increases in speed over time as well. The goal of course is to keep one's points above the enclosing zone for as long as possible, or at least for a longer amount of time than the other players so that one is the only player 'alive'. When one's points / progress is lower than the current zone, the player will lose health points until they are 'dead' or until they are once again ahead of the zone. As mentioned before, the game continues until there is one player left. Some extra features include randomized power-ups and question streak bonuses. StackThis game was built using a stack consisting of Javascript, Node.js, Express.js wrapper, and Socket.IO. It is hosted on Heroku. We started with the basic idea of creating the game for a single player scenario where the user should be able to answer the questions infinitely or until they 'die'. This was on a local level as well. We then expanded to adding a seemingly infinite amount of players that can play against each other, however, that was also on a local level. Finally, we expanded to hosting the app on Heroku so players on different devices can play with each other.ChallengesAs with any web socket or Node application, the most prominent issue we ran into was the infamous async issue. We faced a variety of async issues in peculiar locations of our codebase and it was quite difficult to be able to identify these issues accordingly. We first tackled such issues by setting timeouts to block execution of code until some certain segments finished running, however we soon realized that this solution was not scalable and would vary in success on different devices and with different amount of requests. We then decided to utilize more bidirectional socket emit events such that the code segments we want to run after a certain code segment runs would only do so in that manner, emulating a callback function or rather a promise even. Other issues we ran into were mainly syntax issues and what not.AccomplishmentsWe are very proud of our ability to expand our application throughout many stages. We came in thinking we would make a singleplayer game that only ran locally, and overtime as we crossed of checkmarks, we ended up with a full fledged multiplayer game that is hosted online. We are very proud of our overall team cooperation and divvying up of tasks. We were very organized and utilized our time efficiently in terms of code sprints and discussions, etc. What We LearnedWe learned a lot about handling asynchronous issues without using promises and async await functions. We also had team members who were new to coding in general and they learned a lot about front end web development, design, and even an extensive amount of git commands. We also learned a lot more about version control and how rebasing works and also the importance of different branches especially in larger group projects such as these. We also learned about hosting and a lot of similar online services and how they interact with our application.Future PlansWe believe Math Jam has a lot of potential and the next steps would be fine tuning the game in terms of design and functionality and then of course adding more and more features as we see fit. We could even add more dynamic game modes and what not for a more enjoyable experience.Built Withexpress.jsherokujavascriptnode.jssocket.ioTry it outmathjam.herokuapp.com      Submitted to    HackIllinois 2019    Created by  Aviral SaxenaMichael ZhouMichael Kwanpanfj "", ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['javascript', 'node.js', 'express.js', 'socket.io', 'heroku']","False","19","['aviralsaxena', 'aitori', 'michaelkwan', 'panfj']","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/768/973/datas/small.png","False","0"
"Weekly Commitment for JIRA Cloud","The best way to motivate yourself.

That is why we engage fitness-trainers and coaches in our life. The same thing is with software development.If you want to have more motivation, just promise your colleagues to do something during the week and review the results on Friday. Weekly Commitment add-on provides you the simplest way to do this. "", ""The add-on allows you to mark any JIRA issue as your commitment. This way you promise your colleagues to resolve it until the end of the week. You can create a few commitments and use 'My commitments' page in order not to forget about them.Every project member can see 'Weekly commitments' page within the project to understand who made commitments on which issues. The same page is great to maintain Friday retrospective meeting with your team, to understand if all commitments were fulfilled.Every commitment can be in one of the following states:BLUE – Week in a progress. You have time to resolve the issueGREEN – You've resolved the issue during the week you've made commitment.RED – Week passed, but you haven't resolved the issue yet.YELLOW – You've resolved the issue but not in time.Built Withjavajavascriptreactspring-bootTry it outmarketplace.atlassian.com      Submitted to    Atlassian Codegeist 2017    Created by  Maxim Kuzmich [StiltSoft] "", ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['java', 'javascript', 'spring-boot', 'react']","False","19","['mkuzmich']","https://firefly-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/usercontent/fill/242/161/cGhvdG9zL3Byb2R1Y3Rpb24vc29mdHdhcmVfdGh1bWJuYWlsX3Bob3Rvcy8wMDAvNTI0LzYzNC9kYXRhcy9vcmlnaW5hbC5wbmc=/logo_hires_3_2.png?signature=2c2c15173c1ddb9e5937a1be438f22c16b71348a","False","0"

"Adaptavist ScriptRunner for JIRA Cloud","Extend, automate and enhance your JIRA workflows in JIRA Cloud","[4562, ""ScriptRunner for JIRA is the 3rd on the Atlassian Marketplace list of top selling JIRA add-ons (inside of 1 year). Due to sheer customer demand, Adaptavist wanted to offer the same functionality through JIRA Cloud.ScriptRunner for JIRA Cloud started off as a ShipIt project last year where we achieved a proof of concept. We extended beyond the ShipIt work during the Atlassian Connect week in Amsterdam this year. Now we're ready to launch our fully fledged Cloud add-on.Why it's specialScriptRunner for JIRA Cloud allows you to extend the functionality of JIRA Cloud, executing scripts to interact with JIRA as Post Functions or Event Listeners. Scripts can take actions such as updating an issue during a transition or performing a calculation and storing the result in a custom field on the issue. Administrators have the power of the Groovy programming language at their disposal to respond to events and transitions, manipulating JIRA using the REST API.It also allows admins and power users to quickly extend JIRA Cloud functionality to support your business processes in your workflows by scripting post functions without the hassle of writing a fully-fledged Connect Add-on.Features include:Run your own customised Groovy scripts from the Script Console in your JIRA Cloud instanceBuilt-in ScriptCopy Custom Field ValuesBuilt-in Workflow Post Functions likeClone IssueCreate SubtaskConditionally Fast-Track Transition an IssueTransition Parent IssueModify IssueExamplesDo a calculation using existing custom fields and update a calculated fieldPost a message to HipChat room based on a specific updated issue eventScript ListenersCalculated Custom FieldPost to HipChat based on a Version Release eventCreate Issues whenever a project is created (automatically)Extend the JIRA notifications based on specific fields changing in an issueChallenges we ran intoScripts in ScriptRunner Cloud do not execute within the same process as JIRA and so must interact with JIRA using the REST APIs rather than the JAVA APIs. Atlassian Connect is also inherently asynchronous which means that when a script executes the user may see the page load before the script has completed.Asynchronous execution is at the heart of the Atlassian Connect Framework that ScriptRunner must use to extend JIRA Cloud. JIRA fires webhooks when events and transitions occur and any user interface elements are loaded in iframes. It is not possible to veto, cancel or otherwise prevent JIRA performing an action using ScriptRunner. Scripts themselves are written synchronously, that is REST API calls are made in a blocking style (although async methods are provided too).All user provided code is executed in an isolated container. ScriptRunner for JIRA Cloud is a service that is shared by many customers so isolation is very important that when executing scripts. Isolation is a goal that has been core to the design of ScriptRunner for JIRA from its inception. Each customer has a container that is theirs and theirs only. It is not possible for the code of one customer to have been run in the container of another. Containers are also designed to be single use, however it is possible that containers will be re-used for execution on occasion, but script writers should not rely on this. Disk storage in these containers is ephemeral, any changes written to the disk will be discarded.What's next for ScriptRunner for JIRA CloudWe will be looking at all of the functionality available in JIRA Server and working out whether it can be achieved in the Connect Framework and via the REST API.More built-in scriptsAdd advanced JQL Functions like hasComments, hasAttachments, hasSubtasks, hasLinks, myProjects, recentProjects and moreAbility to customise the JIRA User Interface with buttons of your choosingScheduled jobs like an escalation serviceBuilt Withatlassianes6groovyjiraTry it outmarketplace.atlassian.com      Submitted to    Atlassian Codegeist 2016    Created by  I worked on backend Groovy and frontend Javascript and ops :)jbevanI worked on the UI to keep it in line with Adaptavist and Atlassian look and feel.Sharon HindeJon MortMartin BrehovskyJamie EchlinAndrzej WieczorekMark McCormackAdam Markham "", ' ', ' ', ""Scripts in ScriptRunner Cloud do not execute within the same process as JIRA and so must interact with JIRA using the REST APIs rather than the JAVA APIs.

"In The Loop","Live-Updated News Aggregating Web App","[5964, 'Following the recent tragic attacks in Paris, Beirut, and other places, the world has seen the chaos that followed during and after the events. We saw how difficult it was for people to find everything they wanted to know as they searched through dozens of articles and sites to get a full perspective on these trending topics. We wanted to make learning everything there is to know about trending topics effortless. ', ""Our app provides varied information on trending topics aggregated from multiple news sources. Each article is automatically generated and is an aggregation of excerpts from many sources in such a way that there is as much unique information as possible. Each article also includes insights on the attitude of the writer and the political leaning of the excerpts and overall article.ProcedureTrending topics are found on twitter (in accordance to pre-chosen location settings).Find top 30 hits in each topic's Bing results.Parse each article to find important name entities, keywords, etc. to be included in the article.Use machine learning and our scripts to select unique excerpts and images from all articles to create a final briefing of each topic.Use machine learning to collect data on political sentiment and positivity.All of this is displayed in a user-friendly web app which features the articles on trending topics and associated data visualizations. "", 'We began with the idea of aggregating news together in order to create nice-looking efficient briefings, but we quickly became aware of the additional benefits that could be included into our project. Notably, data visualization became a core focus of ours when we realized that the Indico API was able to provide statistics on emotion and political stance. Using Charts.JS and EmojiOne, we created emoticons to indicate the general attitude towards a topic and displayed the political scattermap of each and every topic. These allow us to make very interesting finds, such as the observation that Sports articles tend to be more positive than breaking news. Indico was also able to provide us with mentioned locations, and these was subsequently plugged into the Google Places API to be verified and ultimately sent to the Wolfram API for additional insight.A recurring object of difficulty within our project was ranking, where we had to figure out what was ""better"" and what was not. Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that keywords and points were scatted across all paragraphs within a news story. A challenge in itself, a solution came to our minds. If we matched each and every paragraph to each and every keyword, a graph was formed and all we needed was maximal matching! Google gods were consulted, programming rituals were done, and we finally implemented Kuhn\'s Max Matching algorithm to provide a concise and optimized matching of paragraphs to key points. This recurring difficulty presented itself once again in terms of image matching, where we initially had large pools (up to 50%) of our images being logos, advertisements, and general unpleasantness. While a filtering of specific key words and image sizes eliminated the bulk of our issues, the final solution came from an important observation made by one of our team members: Unrelated images generally have either empty of poorly constructed alt tags. With this in mind, we simply sorted our images and the sky cleared up for another day. The list of technicalities:Implemented Kuhn\'s Max MatchingUsed Python Lambda expressions for quick and easy sortingAdvanced angular techniques and security filters were used to provide optimal experiencesExtensive use of CSS3 transforms allowed for faster and smoother animations (CSS Transforms and notably 3D transforms 1. utilize the GPU and 2. do not cause page content rerendering)Responsive design with Bootstrap made our lives easierIonic Framework was used to quickly and easily build our mobile applicationsOur Python backend script had 17 imports.
