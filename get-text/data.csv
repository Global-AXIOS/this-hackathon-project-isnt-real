', ""This game is a turn based, last man standing elimination game.  My favorite part of this is the cryptography concepts.  Unfortunately I was unable to fully implement them, but I have lots of ideas about having different parts of the save file partially encrypted, or multiple layers of encryption by different asymmetric, or symmetric key systems, to create parts of rooms that are harder to get access to.  Different parts of the file would be encrypted in different ways, and at different strengths.  The players would have control over things that were encrypted and how.  The game would be about aquiring resources in order to out-cypher your enemies.  As your cryptographic power increases during the game, you would be able to decrypt more and more of your opponent's parts of the file, to eventually locate them and destroy them.  This game would use a save file to store the game state at varying levels of encryption.  Anyone who runs the game with that file would be able to join into that round of the game, as long as they can send the file back to the other participants (with their moves added to the mix).  I actually see this file sharing mechanism as a big strength for flexibility and interesting concepts in the game (security risks aside lol).  It also allows people without a strong or stable internet connection to participate.  You just need to be able to send a single file (and it doesn't have to be transmitted fast either, as long as it arrives in one piece).  The branching file mechanism, whereby anyone who has a file can play in that world, but the people who originally were playing there may just be participating on a different branch, or instance, of the same file, is very interesting to me.

This is helpful before a natural disaster -- if a house is flooded, for example, there will be no record of what the user owned, how much it was worth, et cetera.

However it is not that convenient to log in every time to check, for example, todo list for today. It would be nice to have a Slack bot that can push notifications and provide some manual query functions that can integrate Canvas into Slack. ', 'So far, it is simply a demo. The user can add the app into their Slack workspace, then follow the setup process to connect with their own Canvas account, then they would be able to fetch the current course list from Canvas. ', 'We used the transposit for transferring data from Canvas to Slack. By default, transposit has native support for Slack, so that can be used. However, it does not have support for Canvas. So we used SwaggerHub to create an (incomplete) OpenAPI 3.0 compatible definition of the Canvas LMS REST API. With API definition we created a Canvas Connector on transposit. Then it is possible to use SQL to query items from Canvas. ', 'In the Canvas API, the way they implement the parameter serialization is weird. Instead of the normal way of doing like ""list=item0&list=item1"", ""list=item0,item1""or ""list[0]=item0&list[1]=item1"", they decided to implement it as ""list[]=item0&list[]=item1"". This way of doing serialization is not supported in OpenAPI. This is fine, it can still be described with OpenAPI. Just rename the parameter from list to list[], then use the normal explode serialization. However this is acceptable when calling in the SQL, or probably from many other languages, as item[] is not a legal parameter name. So far we had to leave it out for now.Another challenge is the key expiration. Token from Canvas can have a expiration duration. Manually generated token never expires, so that\'s fine. However, token requested by third-party applications such as this bot via OAuth 2.0 would expire in 1 hour. The application need to refresh the token at least every hour. Transposit uses a ""managed authentication"" flow, where the token is managed by the transposit. Luckily it provided a ""runtime"" authentication method, allowing the application script to fetch the token. Though the application is unable to store the new refreshed token back, it may just use the token for the first time, then store all new tokens to user settings as a setting. However this is not perfect, runtime authentication cannot be used in conjunction with OAuth 2 managed authentication, making it rather hard for user to setup their account for the first time. ', ""It actually works, though Canvas and Transposit doesn't really fit together (as we found out later) "", 'Do thorough investigation before choosing the platform or framework.

But their are certain quirks in Canvas that doesn't well translate to transposit's expected interface. Unless Transposit has workarounds for these quirks, we might actually need to move out from Transposit, and implement the bot purely in JavaScript or Python, so all the proposed functions can be implemented.

Project Grizzly uses five foot tall rod to detect biomass density and environmental changes to assess potential outbreaks of fire. Forest fires feed off of dense leaf and plantae coverage. Knowing which portions of the forest have a growing collection of dead leaves and thick moss allows us to know where to be wary of forest fires. The ROD gathers this data using… It then sends this data via satellite using satellite networking solutions such as Abela by Inmarsat. This data gets processed by Project Grizzly and then is determined to be potentially dangerous or not. Data acquisition and analysis is what makes Project Grizzley so powerful. The use of various data sets along with machine learning algorithms, allows Project Grizzley to predict and locate potential forest fires in continuously changing ecosystem. Project Grizzley uses MongoDB to store data from the ROD and GPS tracking systems. This data is then processed through IBM Watson to get probability values of forest fires occurring in specific locations. Project Grizzly adjusts and gathers data for unique environments. Every ROD and tracking group gathers data for a specific location, which allows us to monitor precise areas.   ', 'Essentially our data from our GPS tracking system and ROD device is sent to our MongoDB server using the satellite technology, Abela by Inmersat. This data is then processed by our model in IBM - Watson. ', 'The biggest technical challenge we ran into was using IBM - Watson to run data processing tasks on our data set.The next challenge was product design. We spent a lot of time trying to figure out was Project Grizzly is and what exactly it does.  ', 'Going off of the challenges we faced, we are very proud of the vision of Project Grizzly and what it is designed to do. We think our network design is unique and well thought out. Our intended network is complex but solves its intended problem with sensible solutions. Tracking animals and having a biomass and local environment sensor makes a lot of sense.  ', 'We learned a decent amount of MongoDB and IBM Watson technology. We realized a new, at least for us, usage for both of these technologies. It was also the first time a couple of us tied together data acquisition with machine learning.  ', 'The next step immediate step for Project Grizzly would be to use a prototype ROD to gather biomass and weather data from a local environment. We want to then process this data and see what we can model from data processing. We would also like to gather GPS data for animal patterns and run it into machine learning algorithms like IBM Watson. Though, this animal tracking step is a little more resource heavy than a prototype ROD. If we were to carry out this project down the road, we believe that a sufficient prototype network consists of tracking systems in a small population of grizzly bears, elk, and deer along with dozens of ROD devices placed in different parts of forests. At this point even tho we would not have much data, we would want to still process it in relatively real time through a satellite and into our machine learning model.

We learned that each of their networks are client-server models, with ""PapaDucks"" acting as servers, and individual ducks as clients. Additionally, we realized that their product is mainly the physical network, not software on that network for disaster survivors.We decided that our goal was to help survivors in the event of internet and cellular service loss maintain their ability to stay informed and communicate with the people around them with already-existing technology in their pockets.

Main functionality so far includes: network-wide chat and disaster relief information spreading.Our chatroom is quite simple. Since every node in the network can connect directly to every other node, whenever the user enters a chat message, every other user receives it. This allows quick, scalable chatting. Through an IBM cloud object storage resource, we set up a ""bucket"" in which we, or in the future first responders, news outlets, and disaster alert services, can store the most relevant data to disaster survivors. Then, when a machine running our p2p network detects that it can connect to the internet, it downloads this data, reconnects to the network, and sends it to all the other machines on the network.

Similar to how votes are measured without collecting the name of a voter, our app displays the opinions of employees within a company while keeping the anonymity and privacy of those employees. Each employee has a username and password that they register for authentication purposes.

However, because of the laborious nature of re-writing one's entire course material on flashcards just to be able to review from them, many find it not worthwhile to spend time creating them.

Thus making the user aware of his/her contributions and keeping him/her motivated about helping the environment.Creation:The initial phase of the project involved the creation of a Chrome extension. For the chrome extension, we had to use javascript primarily for all the functionalities and JSON for the manifest. The main focus of the extension was to search for similar eco-friendly products as to ones enlisted in the cart of an eCommerce site. We achieve that by using an API along with our NLP - RAKE model which extracts keywords from the cart's products and feeds it to the API to get similar eco-friendly products. Beyond this, we have also created a web dashboard that would help the user keep track of his changes. In that, we measure various metrics like savings in terms of emission, materials ( plastic, etc. ) and also showcasing overall contribution of all users to motivate each user to do better. Challenges:There were various challenges we encountered, few of which were related to the extension development which none of us had done before. Few were related to the google cloud app engine since it is meant for a proper Production environment. Hence, we had to apply appropriate techniques to get it set for our application. It consumed a lot of time, but was worth developing since dealing with issues was easier once it was set up since it was a prod environment and debugging was cleaner. Accomplishments:Created a chrome extension from scratch with minimal external assistanceBypassed various hurdles in terms of unavailability of Amazon API( only available for associates ) which was our basic framework when we were planning it. Developed a flask web app in a Prod environment to be pushed into the Google Cloud App EngineTakeaways: What we learnedLearnt how to build an extensionLearnt how to build web applications in a Production environment In the process of learning about our target audience, we realized how many people actually want to make changes for the environment, but don't have enough information to act on it in their busy livesUsed NLP-RAKE model and analysis of various other models for short sized keyword extractionScope:  What's next for ecoShopperEcoShopper can have varied applications in the real-world. We intend to expand it to a mobile application that not only gives the user an alternative for shopping stuff, but at other daily activities too. For example, if a user intends to take a cab ride, ecoShopper should give the user alternative eco-friendly options like walking, taking a bike ride or taking the bus. We intend ecoShopper act as the required impetus in order to influence people to take greener steps.Built Withbootstrapchromecssflaskgoogle-cloudhtml5javascriptnatural-language-processingnltkpythonsqlTry it outecoproduct-257823.appspot.comgithub.com      Submitted to    HackDuke: Code for Good 2019Winner                Most Viable Hack                  Created by  Worked on some parts of the extension and the flask serverArul Thileeban SagayamMay KPRERONA DUTTAtonyrubensjp "", ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['css', 'html5', 'flask', 'google-cloud', 'chrome', 'javascript', 'sql', 'natural-language-processing', 'nltk', 'python', 'bootstrap']","False","0","['rocknroll9898', 'pdutta3', 'arulthileeban023', 'antonybstack', 'rubensjp']","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/880/894/datas/small.png","False","0"

"Autism Speaks","""if you've met an individual with autism ,you've met one individual with autism "". Approximately 1% (7.5 billion) of the global population is affected by autism and we are here to help them .  ","[5894, 'Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment condition associated with significant healthcare costs, and early diagnosis can significantly reduce these. The economic impact of autism and the increase in the number of ASD cases across the world reveals an urgent need for the development of easily implemented and effective screening methods. Therefore, a time-efficient and accessible ASD screening is imminent to help health professionals and inform individuals whether they should pursue formal clinical diagnosis. The rapid growth in the number of ASD cases worldwide necessitates datasets related to behaviour traits. However, such datasets are rare making it difficult to perform thorough analyses to improve the efficiency, sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of the ASD screening process. Presently, very limited autism datasets associated with clinical or screening are available and most of them are genetic in nature.  ', 'Hence, we propose a new dataset related to autism screening of adults that contained 20 features to be utilised for further analysis especially in determining influential autistic traits and improving the classification of ASD cases.With just the help of these features - including sample questionnaires and some birth facts, we have provided a Machine Learning model that can evaluate the chances of a person being diagnosed with autism with an accuracy of around 80%.  ', 'We took Autism Screening Questionnaires and developed a set of features with the output being in a binary format of 0 or 1 evaluating or NO or a YES.Some of these Questions were as follows:. has a deviant style of communication with a formal, fussy, old-fashioned or “robotlike” language          invents idiosyncratic words and expressionshas a different voice or speechexpresses sounds involuntarily; clears throat, grunts, smacks, cries or screamsis surprisingly good at some things and surprisingly poor at othersuses language freely but fails to make adjustment to fit social contexts or the needs of different listenerslacks empathymakes naïve and embarrassing remarkshas a deviant style of gazewishes to be sociable but fails to make relationships with peerscan be with other children but only on his/her termslacks best friendlacks common senseis poor at games: no idea of cooperating in a team, scores “own goals”.We also had other features such as ethnicity, gender etc.The dataset was then refined in order to reduce the features by cutting down the ones that weighted a lot less by having very little significance on the output classification.We deployed the model in 2 phases: Used several distinct classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest and an Ensemble Classifier to get the best possible trained model and evaluate it based on past models used. Ran the model on Google Colab.Used IBM Watson to generate a model for the refined data we had. It made it easier since it showed 4 pipelines with different hyper-parameters tuning. We created a model and deployed the same to be used on our mobile devices as a service. ', 'Overfitting was the most serious problem we had. Finding the correct ratio of bias vs variance was really difficult to find as some features were being overweighed by our models thereby making the other features redundant.This was more prominently happening on IBM Watson as it tries to derive the best possible model by running huge number of epochs and iterations over the model thereby overfitting it.As far as manual running was concerned, we reduced overfitting by tuning the hyper-parameters such as reducing the number of epochs, using different models to come up with a better fit for unseen inputs, etc.For IBM Watson, we observed that the testing data was very less as it automatically uses only 5% of the data for testing and 95% for training. So the model is overtrained on a number of examples it observes. We increased the amount of testing data to 30%.After that, we had to make altercations with the data, as it was not consistent with data types, thereby causing problems in giving a better result.So we made the data consistent with data types and the model started giving way better results.We saved this model and deployed it for using it as a service. ', 'Waiting times for an ASD diagnosis are lengthy and procedures are not cost effective. By using our methodology of incorporating Machine Learning with probable screening questionnaires, we will be able to cull out these problems and it will be viable for everyone to use. This is a model created with keeping people in mind. We want to make sure that everyone is given an equal and proper chance to diagnose their child with autism. ', 'We were able to learn the AutoAI feature of IBM Cloud and how using it can save considerable time and space. Apart from that, we were able to effectively run and train the model on Google Colab which was furthermore a big advantage for us. ', 'We want to improve the accuracy of our model and improve the dataset further. There is a lot of variance in screening questions from place to place and we want to try incorporating all those with dependencies on the place the person being diagnosed is from.

"SafeZone","Save lives with the touch of a button","[5289, 'The City of Ottawa is currently upgrading their hospitals to a new electronic health record system, and rather than speeding up the process, the slow learning curve for the system has drastically increased wait times for emergency response teams. One of our team-mates hosted a tournament where a player tore their achilles, when 911 was called it was estimated that the ambulance would come in 1 hour. When a victim is in an emergency situation, receiving immediate first aid could save their life. For example, a non-breathing victim who receives CPR immediately has a much higher chance of survival than someone who waited for an ambulance to arrive. Our team member Hari, who is certified in First Aid and CPR, realized that there are many people who are certified to be able to provide basic First Aid and perhaps minor treatment for a person in need. So he came up with the idea of an app that can instantly connect a person in need to nearby First Responders.  ', 'Using SafeZone, a user can call for help after which they will immediately connected to a nearby First Responder. Depending on the severity of the situation, the user will be advised to still call 911. Once the Responder is on the way, he/she will be able to contact the user who requested help to provide helpful instructions or get to know the situation before arriving. In an ideal scenario, the Responder reaches the user and provides First Aid until EMS arrives. In order for a user to be recognized as a First Responder on SafeZone, they must upload certification and wait for approval.  ', ""SafeZone was built as an Android application using Kotlin and Android Studio. We wanted the app to be clean in terms of design and for the user experience to be easy. So we made a very detailed design on Figma with all the views and app-flows before starting the development of the app. Google Firebase is powering our authentication, database, storage, and backend functions. We're using Google Cloud Platform/Google Maps API to get user location, calculating routes and distances. "", 'During the course of the hackathon we ran into a few challenges. The most prominent ones included some aspect of troubleshooting the google maps API. It was challenging to retrieve the location of the user, along with calculating the location of the closest first responder. In order for the google maps API to function properly, the user must provide some permissions that enable services. Setting these permission also brought up some challenges such as what happens if a user rejects the permission request.  ', 'We were able to produce a full minimum viable product over this 37 hour hackathon, from building a thorough design flow to implementing the basic functions of SafeZone. Though we ran into many technical road blocks along the way, we were able to overcome them all by making use of the expertise of each of our team members and staying organized throughout our design and build process. We established a clear work flow which focused the direction of our project and created a clean foundation for SafeZone.

Sentiment scores were rated on a scale from -0.9 to 0.9 with a magnitude, representing the strength of the sentiment. The sentiment scores from each and every article were aggregated to calculate the final average score for the stock. Challenges:We initially wanted to train our own model using the Fast.AI and the Stanford IMDB Movie Review Dataset. Given the time constraints we had to complete this project, it was unrealistic to complete due to a egregious training time.

When you need to pick up a new prescription, or are running low on your current order, we deliver! Using our app you can have a drone from your local pharmacy drop your medication securely to your location. ', ""PharmaFly is a platform composed of three distinct applications: A mobile app for consumers, a web-based integration platform, and a flying Linux box :) Our mobile application aims to be a centralized portal which allows consumers to manage all of their medication-related needs, including but not limited to: prescription drop-off, delivery and refills. Our web platform not only enables us to relay catalog and transaction information between our database and our mobile app, it also facilitates drone communications over HTTP for on demand deliveries! Both of these applications rely heavily on different web technologies such as: HTML 5, CSS, Javascript ES6, Python Flask, Gunicorn, and a multitude of NCR's REST API's.Finally, our drone is the centerpiece for our platform. Utilizing a Navio2 Raspberry Pi shield, our drone is a fully functional Linux box (WITH WINGS!!!). Our current software stack of: Raspbian, Mavproxy, INAV, Ardupilot, and ROS offers the freedom to connect with virtually any API or cloud service. Our current automation process allows a consumer to order their prescription medicine, have their information looked up and parsed from NCR's databases, and then uses Google Maps Geocoding API to automatically generate precise mission plans that allow any Ardupilot-based drone to fly waypoint to waypoint without a human pilot! "", ""The biggest challenge we faced during this hackathon was due to our flight controller short circuiting on Saturday night. A large amount of time went into attempting to repair the drone, but when it seemed our hardware may have been damaged beyond a Saturday night's repair, we had to push back the development of our automated delivery system. "", 'We believe that one of our biggest accomplishments is that we recognized how much it costs for a person to get out of their house and get their groceries, medicine supplements. etc. And from that view, we see the importance that a drone would save a lot of commuting time for a person in a day. We overcame our comfort-zone in many aspects. The group has a diverse skill from web development to data science, etc. We had a chance to share the skills and learned from each other what we were uncomfortable with before. We had several challenges during the process in the last 2 days. However, we were flexible and in-cooperated well enough to overcome those obstacles. And finally, we have the demo reflects well with our ideas. ', ""Not only did we learn new technical skills, we also were forced to improvise when our drone delivery platform no longer was able to utilize drones for delivery... We were able to establish a large portion of our back end services so that most other Ardupilot drones can quickly utilize our platform and deliver a plethora of goods. This process taught us how to debug hardware, and how to overcome the challenges associated with failed hardware, which wouldn't have been possible with a purely software stack. "", 'We\'ve only scratched the surface of our platforms capabilities... Not only can we eventually automate pharmaceutical deliveries, we also strive to create a peer-to-peer drone delivery market where individuals can ""rent"" their drones by downloading our software, picking up, and delivering virtually any good that NCR can provide information on! Machine vision is also another possible application in the consumer world. An idea we initially had was to use machine vision to automate food delivery and drink refills inside of large restaurants, resulting in savings for businesses and customers alike!

"PETA virus","A malicious Windows encryptor","[5197, 'The PETA virus is inspired by and shares many characteristics with the infamous Petya ransomware that infected many Windows PCs just three years ago. The issue is that this ransomware will allow you to recover your files that it encrypts, albeit at a cost, and in addition, it has been cracked and a master key is available that will decrypt most versions of the ransomware. So, for this project, we decided to turn Petya, an infuriating but recoverable ransomware into a completely irreversible and malicious piece of code that causes fatal damage to Windows PCs. And it can all happen simply by plugging in a flash drive. ', ""The PETA virus is a portable piece of malware injected onto a flash drive that can be started by simply opening a malicious executable disguised as a convincing PDF persuading the user to open it. Once a gullible victim opens the file, the executable launches, enabling another one to cause the MBR to be overwritten and the Windows system encrypted. While the payload operates, performance of your PC will drastically drop and applications will run slower. Shortly after, the PC will crash and a Blue Screen of Death will open. When the computer is reset, Windows will no longer boot. Once this happens, the malware's work is complete. And to think all of this can be prevented by simply refusing to open a PDF just adds insult to injury. "", 'We built our app originally off of just batch code, but we quickly realized this was not a permanent or lethal enough solution. We quickly turned to online repositories, and came across a 2016 trojan that did not require any administrator prompts to run or be detected by most anti-virus software.In fact, the main executable used to start the malicious code was only detected as dangerous by 10% of anti-virus software, as shown in this free online virus tester:https://bit.ly/2qdz46SWe then built our deployment method around that, disguised as a PDF. The moment the PDF is opened, malicious code wipes the Master Boot Record, rendering your computer a high-tech paperweight. ', 'User Account Control was the bane of our existence. No matter what payload we loaded, it would always demand an administrator password, not ideal for most standard users. Another problem was executing the PDF. We would have liked to have it execute the moment the USB mounts, but sadly Windows fixed that back in Windows ME. ', 'We managed to create a mass-distributive virus with relatively simple code that would destroy the computer of any of those unfortunate to open the PDFs. That alone gives us an immense sense of accomplishment. ', 'We learned that the User Account Control is one of the most useful barricades for simple malware.

We had realized that this trend was heavily influenced by posture while sitting down, especially when using electronics. With technology becoming a ubiquitous utility in our lives, our poor posture needs to be corrected before it becomes permanent and harmful to our health. That’s why we created PoseRight, a tool to monitor and encourage proper posture while sitting at a computer. ', ""PoseRight uses a camera to analyze the user's posture using the pre-trained PoseNet model. from Tensorflow. The camera is connected to a Google Coral development board, which analyzes the data from the camera to give a rating on their posture. The resulting data is sent to a server and database where it’s later retrieved by a Google Chrome extension and the website. If the extension starts to detect the user’s position is worsening, the screen will blur the tabs that the user is using. It unblurs if their posture improves. With the Coral development board, we are able to process all the data client side. This serves two main purposes, the first is that it classifies in approximately 2 milliseconds since network latency is eliminated. This speed is important when working with real time data. Secondly, it eliminates any privacy concerns as the live video feed is never stored or exposed to the internet, ensuring that you are in control of your own data. In the end, the data stored in the database is graphed in two charts, allowing the user to see their posture over time.Challenges we ran intoThere was a more accurate network architecture (ResNet50) available for Tensorflow.js, but we were unable to convert the model to conform to the Edge TPU standard. At first, we were unsure of how to interface between the three points in the project; however, in the end, we opted to use a solution where the extension and Coral board used the server as an intermediary to communicate with each other by pulling and pushing data.

"FireVision","A modern approach to forest fire detection and containment using computer vision and machine learning.","[5158, 'Fire detection systems are essential safety devices that have been around for some time now. Of these, traditional particulate-based smoke-detection devices are the most common, yet unfortunately, these are not always suitable for use in certain areas. Namely, large open areas such as national parks require staffers in fire lookout towers to observe the surrounding landscape for signs of smoke or fire throughout the year; however, it costs money and time to hire these staffers and build fire lookout towers. ', ""In response to this issue, we have used computer vision and machine learning algorithms to automate the process of surveying these kinds of areas for signs of fire. This way, only a few cameras placed sparsely apart are needed to monitor the surrounding wilderness, drastically reducing the cost of this operation. Whenever a camera sees an image that the algorithm recognizes as a fire, it notifies the central system immediately with information about the fire's coordinates, allowing rangers to respond quickly and efficiently. "", 'We tried to recognize smoke as our main part of a project, since the first indicator of a forest fire is the smoke rising from the ground. The main processing part of the project was built using Google Cloud. We used the Auto-ML machine vision library to recognize and supply the bounding boxes for any smoke that was detected. Our model was a custom trained one, which required us to upload large numbers of sample images, and manually mark them. After that was done, we simply sent a request to the Google Cloud server based on each frame of our video feed and parsed the results to display the video on our website in real-time. Another significant part of our project was the real time tracking of data that had been identified by Auto-ML. Since each camera is fixed, we know the GPS coordinate of that camera. When the camera detects smoke, a notification pops up on our website, indicating that a certain number of fires were found, as well as a detailed Google Maps panel pointing to the fires. This makes monitoring the system extremely easy.  ', 'One major challenge we faced was how our model was incorrectly recognizing background clouds as smoke. We tried a few things. First, we converted the image into binary black/white, and only recognize parts where the whiteness of the smoke was seen over the black background. This however, proved to be too unreliable due to the varying thicknesses of the smoke involved. Second, since smoke starts from the ground, we attempted to filter out results based on whether it crossed the horizon in our image, but we realized smoke that was already far up in the air would be classified as clouds in this process. We finally decided to train another model, based upon only the starting location of the smoke, intentionally capturing some of the surrounding ground in the process. This proved to be the most reliable model throughout our tests. ', 'Although we did not accomplish all of the goals we set out to do, we are still glad that we were able to get pretty far. This was the first time that both of us worked with Google Cloud, computer vision, and web development, let alone all three in the same project. We learned many new skills, such as interacting with servers, building websites, and training and optimizing machine learning models, all within a span of 24 hours. Lastly, both of us had trouble before integrating our separate parts into one coherent project, but this time, we collaborated more efficiently, and were able to do this more seamlessly due to long term planning, and preventative coding.

For the former, we had to code in three new languages, Javascript, CSS, and HTML, and we learned how data is kept secure when interacting with a server. For the latter, this hackathon was the first real exposure both of us had to computer vision, and we learned how images were represented, how to perform operations on them, image editing within python, and simple algorithms. We also had to deal with some advanced material, such as training and optimizing machine learning models, which required us to do some research into both the theory and the accepted practices that people use. ', 'Currently, the main limitation of our project is how we rely on visual data to detect smoke. This means that our ability to detect smoke during the night is severely restricted. A possible solution to this would be to incorporate not only just visual data into our algorithm, but also infrared data based on the temperature gradient between rising smoke and the air around it.

I saw my own coursemates under depression and severe anxiety. To solve this problem, I had to achieve two main things, Make sure that the people are managing their time extremely well and efficiently. Provide them a boost charge, i.e. some kind of portable therapy on the phone to keep them positive and refreshed. This inspired the creation of Project Uplift, an app to solve the most basic need for a ton of people - better time management and pressure handling.  ', 'Project Uplift allows the user to very easily write a task for themselves, complete it, and check it off! The app also includes 50 of the most authentic relaxing sounds that will calm anyone down. All this has been combined with a beautiful user interface theme to make it a powerful beast for its look and feel. There is a time constraint associated with each task that the user has to complete. This will give them the motivation to keep going and fulfill their personal deadlines on time. What if they get stressed during work? The app will remind them to take a break where they can sit back, relax, and enjoy our custom selected sounds designed for ultimate relaxation.  ', 'I built Uplift using the Swift programming language for the iOS ecosystem. Using catalyst (introduced with Xcode 11), the same app can be used to power the iPad, and even the Mac! I used UIKit framework for the User Interface and AVFoundation for the sounds. To keep track of the tasks and completion, I used the native framework Core Data. To design the entire prototype, I used Sketch.  ', ""A lot of challenges! But it's great, because I learned a lot from them. A great feature I wanted in Uplift was the ability to keep track of user's task completions. After a lot of tries, it still wasn't showing any signs of success for the implementation of the feature. But finally, going through the entire code, debugging, following the tracking functions, and a lot of web searching, I was able to get it working perfectly fine. Another User Interface problem was to figure out the best way to combine task and sound controllers. To achieve this, I had to design prototypes and wireframe on Sketch, and then convert it to the final product. In the end, I was very satisfied with the transition.

"Condo22","Improving social connections between young people virtually. Help those who are lonely to regain a sense of community.","[4178, ""The two of us were inspired by the mobile game, Tsuki's Adventures, in which the player logs in periodically to see what the rabbit Tsuki is doing. We realized that the game had a hidden allure - the game play is very simple, barely any, but it worked its way to become one of our favourites of all time. Upon reflection we realized that we loved it because the game maintained Tsuki's independence, that it is not a pet but an independent individual capable of many surprises. Our original idea was to create an app for busy families with a child living away for school. The child would update a virtual character -- like Tsuki -- to reflect their own happenings in life, and their parents would be able to peek in whenever they are free. This would be useful for busy families who would otherwise not have the time to update each other on each of their lives. In the end, however, we chose to do a different but related project that aims to connect peers. The activities people share need to be less sensitive, hence we narrowed it down to  a few categories including studying, gaming, sleeping, out of the house, and secret mode. The significance of this project is that it allows people to join a community of friends, to feel that they are not alone, even while they choose to stay home. Many of our peers tend to stay home for long periods of time, and we have felt for ourselves the sense of isolation that it can bring. Additional benefits of this project include that it allows people to form instant study groups and gaming teams, helping them further their own ventures. We chose the name Condo22 to illustrate the paradoxical reality faced by people who turn to technology for a sense of camaraderie.     "", ""We were not able to finish implementing a functional prototype. Our plan was for the app to show a user what their friends are doing at any time during the day, as long as their friends give them permission to see. We designed the UI to be centered around the Condo, in which each of a user's friends take up one floor. Each friend is represented by a doodle character, and the floors are animated to show what they are currently doing. There are settings that allow each user to customize separately what every one of their friends is allowed to see from them.

"LANdmark","Simple LAN file sharing using Node.js, turning your laptop into a local file-hub.","[6525, 'In my high school, the internet connection speed is terribly slow, but the LAN connection is acceptable. This is the case for a lot of places, of OK LAN but poor Wi-fi coverage. Node.js allows a file server to be hosted on a PC/Mac/Linux machine. I have made a simple file server before, so when people all need to download some large files at the same time, they can download from my laptop at speeds higher than normal after I download it. I put installers of apps required by the school in that folder so that they can be easily accessible in my vicinity.However, this is not enough. Not only did the old program support no more than file download, but the user would also actually have to remember and input a super-long tedious URL. This project is building another platform independent of the previous one to achieve higher capacity, allowing file directory browsing (with folder collapse), file download, file upload, and a file hub function called ""peripheral"" (in beta, explained later). ', 'Download server –\xa0sharing is always welcomeHosts a server on port 3000 to serve dynamic contents from an internal directory in which the user can store his/her own files.Allows directory browsing with collapsible folders and file download links (two types, open in a new tab and direct download, for previewing files and download, respectively).Serves files from the internal directory, so that they can be downloaded by computers on the same LAN.Upload server –\xa0complementary file transfer in the other directionAllows single file uploads via an HTML form.

Its primary goal is ""one installation, multi-direction transfer"" –\xa0that is to say, turning the host\'s computer into a file hub for temporary file storage and limited and directed sharing. I named it Peripheral because it goes around the filter and folder separation at the center.With peripheral, once I launch my LANdmark, other people will be able to perform high-speed file sharing over the LAN through my machine, with the files deleted from the host after a certain delay or after a specific number of downloads (both specified, whichever occurs earlier). This would certainly lower the security measures by a limited amount, but the host will greatly help other people in the area to perform direct file sharing.As a temporary file hub, all files in Peripheral will be deleted on relaunching the server.Peripheral is currently under beta.

"ASC Protocol","Make smart contracts/blockchains able to execute themselves and automatically do things for a user that is offline","[6205, ""Inspired by GSN, which enables one to pay for another's transactions, we decided to generalize the concept of mutually beneficial transactions further. The impetus behind this is two-fold:  1. Requiring people to either be online or run bots in order to manage their blockchain accounts poses a major barrier to adoption. And 2. Remaining silo'd within our own accounts leaves a tremendous amount of value on the table that we could otherwise all benefit from.  "", ""ASC Protocol  = Active Smart Contract/Active State Change (for Cosmos) Protocol. At a high level, ASC allows you to specify conditions under which transactions can be made on your behalf, and economically incentivizes others to fund these transactions when these conditions are met. This opens up a new paradigm of possibility within blockchains. With it, in a decentralized and 100% trustless way, you can do things like:Run scheduled subscription payments that just workStop monitoring DeFi products for changes in rates. Specify your criteria and leave the rest to the bots.Regain the power to use stop-limit/stop-loss orders. There's no reason these financial instruments should be relegated to the world of centralized exchanges. Cause autonomous DAO payments, either to users such as in the case of insurance or UBI, or to oracles and other necessary public goods. We have implemented/designed this functionality in 3 ways:A1) Used ASC Protocol to add stop loss functionality to the new Cosmos DEX (link for the PR is below).A2) Aside: We have also added 2 PRs to Cosmos that should hopefully resurrect their fallen tutorials (links also below).B) Created a ManagedLendingService ASC for AAVE that removes the pressure from users to keep an eye on lending rates. C) Used ASC Protocol to design stop loss functionality for the Waves DEX## How we built it#A1)We used the Cosmos SDK and golang to create a module that allows an application to use a new stop loss order type. We also created a nice UI to show how a user would get their transaction to a relayer (described below).Transaction flow:The user finds a relayer, ideally through a web-market of relayers that have each publicly stated they are willing to hold onto transactions for competing fee rates, such as a stop loss, and watch the relevant price data until they are able to fulfill the condition of the tradeThe user signs a Stop transaction but does not broadcast it to the wider networkThe user privately sends the signed transaction in raw hex format to the chosen relayer through their chosen channel, who then stores the tx locallyThe relayer watches the relevant priceWhen the market price goes above or below the stop price (depending on initPrice), the transaction is able to be executed, so the relayer broadcasts the tx to the wider networkThe tx is executed successfully. The user has bought or sold around their desired price. Cancer is cured. There is peace in the Middle East. World hunger is no more.#B)We created solidity smart contracts that wrap the AAVE money markets to provide a ManagedLendingService. One of the problems with money markets is that they contain technical, economic, and security risk. People are interested in the high yields offered by stablecoins, but don't want to spend their days monitoring the markets for changes. The ManagedLendingService allows you to specify conditions under which your token balance can be deposited or withdrawn from the AAVE money markets, and provides an economic incentive to relayers who cause these state transitions to occur. This results in a specialization of labor that is to the benefit of everyone. More technical users are happy to build bots to watch the blockchain for profit, while more lay users benefit from the ease of use and profit margins that come from automation, causing gains in efficiency and creating value that would otherwise be lost. In addition to the deployed smart contracts, we created a nice UI that we modeled after the current AAVE UI, but with extra fields for specifying the risk tolerance of the user. We then hooked up that UI to the Kovan Ethereum testnet and integrated with MetaMask and the deployed smart contracts. It's an actual working product, end-to-end!#C)We applied the ASC Protocol to Waves to design a stop loss mechanism for their DEX, similar to Cosmos above. More advanced functionalities can also be discussed.## Challenges we ran intoUsing the web3.js library to hook up MetaMask was a challenge as it was highly finnicky. Bad practices abound on stack overflow for web3.js, such as inlining private keys in code and re-inventing the wheel for signing. Understanding Cosmos well enough to start writing code and know how it would fit into the overall architecture of a real application such as the Cosmos DEX was difficult. The tutorials for doing so had many bugs which made it take much longer than it should've, which is why we decided to submit a PR (which has been already merged!) to help others in the future. ## Accomplishments that we're proud ofMainly extending a promising protocol that unlocks functionality within the blockchain space and reduces friction, but also:Understanding Cosmos...kind of....lolBecoming an official Cosmos contributor by getting a PR mergedGetting MetaMask to successfully workCreating a really clean git repo for a hackathon :)## What we learnedThe architecture of Cosmos, how to build modules, and how those modules fit togetherMore detailed Web3.jsHow AAVE works internally## What's next for ASC ProtocolDepends if we have the funds to continue ;)Built WithgolangjavascriptreactsolidityTry it outgithub.comgithub.comgithub.comgithub.com      Submitted to    DeFi HackathonWinner                Money Legos with AAVE - AAVE                  Created by  I developed the front end and helped integrating it with the smart contracts.Hans Paul PizzininiI developed the AAVE ManagedLoanService smart contracts we deployed, and wrote the web backend in web3js to interface with them.

However, various fraud cases regarding H1B lottery have occurred in the past few years, there is even a whole industry chain to help applicants submit multiple applications under different sub-companies’ name, in order to increase the chances of winning. This is clearly unfair to other candidates. Moreover, since the selection process and algorithm of the H1B lottery remain unknown to the wider public, it is difficult for the candidates, and perhaps the government, to track the process and report possible mistakes.Hence we build our lottery system ‘Super Lottery’ to provide multiple lotteries service based on blockchain technology, to tackle these pain points and provide a more fair, transparent, secure, immutable and back-trackable lottery service. There are 2 kinds of lotteries we provide: Anonymous and non-anonymous. The former one is suitable on occasion like H1B that is sensitive to candidate privacy and the latter one could bring more possibilities in usages of the system.Hence we build our lottery system ‘Super Lottery’ to provide multiple lotteries service based on blockchain technology, to tackle these pain points and provide a more fair, transparent, secure, immutable and back-trackable lottery service.

During this procedure, I have a better understanding of the blockchain applications. ', ""As a lottery platform with multiple selections of lotteries, Super Lottery could be practiced in many potential organizations like government, lottery companies, retailers, etc. It could also be potentially used in the wider geographical market. Currently, many small lotteries in the market are restricted by different countries or areas because transactions are hard to be tracked in a different location. Super Lottery might be able to improve this situation with its highly transparent and back-trackable features.In the future, we also want to use computer vision to register candidates' information which can significantly reduce the opportunities of typo compared with entering all the information manually.

"MLTonin","A productivity app to keep track of, evaluate and improve sleep cycles for those with sleep-deprivation","[5028, ' ', ' ', 'We built MLTonin in two main parts, the web interface and the background machine learning processes. The machine learning is done through an ensemble network, composed of a  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We first use a CNN as well as OpenCV to detect a user\'s facial contours and produce a predicted value for drowsiness at any given point in a session. We then pipe that information into a RNN to extrapolate user behavior for more complex analysis on patterns overtime. The data is normalized using the Wolfram api. These values are weighted and compounded into one value that describes the user\'s current energy level (from 0-10). That energy level value is sent to our firebase realtime database (which communicates this data with out front-end UI), as well as a windows-api (which automatically adjusts screen-brightness of the user\'s workspace).The web interface also has an additional CNN, built using tensorflow.js and face-api.js. This model provides expression analysis, which is used for outlier detection in comparison to the other firebase values. The web interface displays an ""Aggregated Sleep Metric"" (ASM), which is calculated by weighing the various inputs (the energy level obtained from firebase and expression analysis values from tensorflow.js) and running them through a consensus algorithm. The consensus algorithm checks relative differences and returns the most appropriate energy value with the given inputs. ', 'One of the most major difficulties we encountered is that our models was over-fitting due to the limited size of our datasets. We solved this by using different metrics (e.g., image pixel data, image contour patterns .etc) and therefore diversifying our training data.Another challenge that we ran into was getting the windows-api working. We encountered bugs interfacing the high-level python scripts with the low-level system apis. We solved the problem by finding third party libraries that skip over the low-level work and using them instead of directly accessing the system apis.What we learnedWe learned so much.

To tackle this issue, we wanted to use machine learning to help the government and farmers predict their yield at the end of each season depending on various factors such as area, season, weather conditions, Methane levels, soil quality etc. ', ""Using Machine learning, we have trained the Random Forest Regressor model on the yield that was produced in previous years as a result of input parameters such as area and season.

The concept has been demonstrated through mobile application graphics.We do wish to delve deeper than the top level prediction approach we have used.

"Emotional-Password-Protection","Real-time emotion recognition for password creation","[3952, ""We wanted to look at using machine learning for data security but couldn't pinpoint a specific area/project we wanted to attempt due to time constraints. We were cautious that we might not have enough time to design, implement, and train a classifier in 24 hours, meaning we wouldn't be able to complete the project. We thought about using facial detection as some sort of safeguard for data. We then found a pre-trained facial emotion classifier here. This model and classifier were freely available through the MIT license. We decided to look at using these detected emotions to create a unique password to protect important files. This password is unique to the emotions shown, the number of emotions, and even the duration specified for each emotion.What we learned:Through this project we learned to be patient and not give up on an idea if it seems hard at first. Initially we were dismissing a lot of projects due to their complexity. We learned that planning is vital to a project like this with a very limited time frame. Coding isn't the biggest problem in a project like this since we can look up documentation easily. The hardest part is finding a project that we can complete in 24 hours, and enjoy doing. We also learned how to allocate work appropriately and consider how difficult each task was. We had to communicate a lot during the project to keep each other updated on progress of different modules. We also did a lot of pair programming for some of the harder parts of the project, as a second pair of eyes allows us to spot errors and issues more easily.How we built it:We based the foundation of the projection on a pre-trained model and classifier found here. We used the classifier itself to detect the emotion of the user a lot better than we may have been able to do on our own. We decided to use this model because creating the model and classifier from scratch would have been incredibly challenging. We used the model to average the users emotions over a period of time, for the specified number of emotions. These averaged emotions were then double hashed using SHA-2 256 bit hashing. This generates a secure password for the user.Challenges:The biggest challenge we faced was to understand the forked work since neither of us were experienced with image classification to that level, especially since only learned a small part of classification for text. The emotional recognition was an entire level of challenge on top of the facial recognition. Finding a pre-trained model was also incredibly difficult.

"GCC Repair Utilities","small suite of software for analyzing,modding,and repairing gamecube controllers","[5469, 'I like playing video games, sometimes my controllers break so I fixed them, then people asked me to fix their controllers and add mods onto them and now I like to repair and mod controllers ', ""This is homebrew for the Wii, this software can run on a modded Wii. First piece of software allows the Wii to act as an oscilloscope reading the voltage values of the main joystick. This is used to  help identify potentiometer drift, which is when the potentiometer no longer reads accurately and the controller moves on it's own in a game. It can also be used for identifying Snapback, which is when you quickly flick a joystick and on its way back it moved to the other size and can cause an input in the opposite direction. If you were to hook up some kind of low voltage low frequency signal you could use it as a oscilloscope for other electronics, not sure why you would want to but the option is there. The next piece of software has the user flick the joystick and calculates what value of capacitor you need to remove snapback. the Snapback is essentially a short voltage spike, and using a correctly valued capacitor can bring this below the deadzone of a controller, a deadzone being the area where the values are not read. It calculates a value between .22uf to 1uf, with a good controller being listed and not needing the mod. This takes out the guesswork and expensive equipment needed to find the correct capacitor.the Third piece of software gives a graphical indication of where shield drop values are compared to the controllers values. Shield drop is a technique in smash melee but to do it consistently you need a controller with angles that let you easily hit the float values needed to do it, they few controllers have it so people can file at the plastic to make it for their controllers. This software helps people more accurately file away their controllers without messing up and wasting a controller shell.The last piece of software is a button tester, it tests most of the button inputs and shows that they are all working correctly, not much to say about this one.I also designed a pcb meant to have user adjustable capacitors with dip switches, as well as a reactive led mod to show that the information you get from my program are applicable to the modification or repair of the hardware. "", 'I spent the whole day before setting up my IDE and getting my one library that i could get to load. It took me a long time to figure out how to make a graph without any libraries or functions to help me, i ended up using a draw rectangle to make pixels, and I have those pixels map out the potentiometer values on the y axis, and 60 times a second it moves the x value to a different position so it can write there allowing for a 10 second sample with a resolution of 60hz.the capacitor mod i took a large amount of controllers and gathered the snapback values before hand and found what capacitor it needed to reduce these to under 20. The user is instructed to flick the controller left 10 times and then down 10 times, it finds the worst spike in value and it will check the data i collected as to what capacitor value should resolve the snapback and tells the user to use that value capacitor.The third one was made using sprites and drawRectangle and drawCircle functions included with the library i was using, it has one large sprite representing the gate of the controller, it has two drawCircles and a Rectangle representing the area of values needed to get a shield drop, and a circle showing where the users joystick is currently, you can compare your location to where it has to be for consistent shield drops and indicates which way to file to react that value. I have a controller i shield drop notched using an older method so i was able to gather what value it had to be and map it to my sprite+circle and rectangle.Last one I had to read through example files as there was no documentation online for how to read all the buttons.

"Hail Yeah!","The main objective of this project is to maximize efficiency in taking preventive measure for mitigating the effects of hail on airplanes on ground and mid-flight.","[6925, 'According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Severe Storms database, there were 4,610 major hail storms in 2018. The depot repair expenses of airliners caused by collisions of foreign matters are up to USD 3-4 billion each year all over the world, leading to flight delay and aviation accidents which further create immeasurable economic losses. Current preventative measures require nearly 10-15 people and approximately 3 hours to deploy covers on the airplane. Humans are exposed to severe weather during these operations. However, in-flight prevention is based around pilot procedure, “When deviating around storms, maneuver on the upwind side so wind is not carrying the storm toward you, and to avoid hail that might spew from the anvil top.” Pilots rely on weather forecast information from air traffic controller (ATC) but hailstorms can not be predicted until last minute with good accuracy. The main motivation behind this study is to maximize efficiency in taking preventive measure to mitigate the effects of hail on airplanes on ground and mid-flight. ', 'This problem is studied in two perspectives, the first case includes the preventive measures for on-ground airplanes and the second case includes risk mitigation for in flight airplanes. The on ground operations require development of infrastructure for building temporary shelters for airplanes during hailstorm. Risk mitigation for mid-air airplanes is achieved by reinforcing the critical structural components by using advanced materials. ', ""We propose a semi-autonomous rover based system which can be deployed to construct a shelter around the plane in advance once the critical weather information is received. Polypropylene material is slippery, moisture resistant and  polypropylene tarps can be used for this application. Our application requires approximately 8100 sq m material based on Boeing-747 dimensions. This material costs  $ 1.20 sq m and the tarp will cost approximately  $9700 for one shelter. The system consists of two sets of rovers on either side of the airplane. The rovers tracks a predefined way-point trajectory. The speed of the rover system is approximately 0.2 m/s, comparable to NASA's Crawler-Transporter which travels at 0.44 m/s in loaded condition. Each rover is equipped with proximity sensors for emergency braking and warning system during operation. This is a semi-autonomous system and the operator can take decisions for deployment and retraction of the system based on the weather. We have created a simulation in SolidWorks to demonstrate the basic functionality of the system and we have developed a hardware prototype of the rover too.  Risk mitigation from hailstorms during flight is proposed to be achieved by using advanced materials which can reinforce the critical components of the aircraft. The primary critical components affected by hail storms are wing leading edges, control surfaces such as ailerons, flaps, slats, elevator and rudder, fuselage nose, engine cowlings and nacelle. Graphene is the strongest material ever tested and it can provide enhanced aerodynamics capabilities. We have created some CAD designs to show this application on actual aircraft components. Graphene based aircraft has already been flight tested on a RC-plane by researchers from University of Central Lancaster in England and the system showed improved flight performance. This material definitely shows better physical and aerodynamic properties as compared to the conventional aircraft materials.  "", 'Identify the problem and define the scope of our proposed solution because we had to address on ground as well as in-flight airplanes. Coming up with a design of the shelter around the plane and operating mechanism due to large and variable dimensions of the planes. Researching a suitable material for creating tarps was also a challenge. We faced challenges in creating the CAD model animations and during preparation of our poster due to some coding issues.  The scope of risk mitigation in-flight was very large and we had to deal with trade-offs in terms of aerodynamic performance and safety of the aircraft. Researching a suitable reinforcement material was also challenging as we had to compare various physical properties wit respect to the conventional aircraft materials.

Current solutions such as hand sanitizer, antimicrobial bins, and nanotechnology mats are not systematic and miss other important areas of contamination within the airport.  With the increase in emerging infections of epidemic and pandemic status as well as increased travel due to economic development, new aircraft, and new routes added, international airports should take precautions in order to reduce the spread of deadly infections.  Public health is a field that concerns the health of all individuals and innovative solutions should be created in aviation in order to influence one of the main forms of transportation around the world. With increased security and threats of bioterrorism, international airports can be the next hub for catastrophic health crisis. We wanted to do something about it.

At the moment, we've set up the system not as an interface with any specific software, but as a demonstration of its ability to differentiate gestures. By virtue of that, we hope that its usability as a universal user interface is acknowledged.In our application, the user starts at a simple menu and can choose to define a new set of gestures or test recognition of their existing gestures. *If they choose to define new gestures, they will be asked how many gestures they want as well as what they should be called.

We wanted to be able to advocate for the LGBTQ+ and non-binary community while also building them a platform to meet new, likeminded people. In addition, to combat the fear of travelling, we generated a way for individuals to travel with other individuals to increase their comfort levels and decrease their travel anxiety. ', 'Essentially, we created a travelling website for non-binary and LGBTQ+ individuals to use and travel the world together, forming new friendships and also establishing a safe and more comforting environment for them. When first accessing the website, users will be able to enter their information (name, birthday, what they identify as, and their Facebook username), three cities they wish to travel to, and what they enjoy doing. After they input this information, their information is stored into a database where our matchmaking takes place. Our matchmaker pairs users up based on age and dream destinations. After the dream destination is set, we coded a web-scraper to find the top things to do in that dream destination. We then reach back out to the matched users with a document, showing their Facebook information so they can reach out and chat through FB messenger, and also a document depicting the top things they can explore and experience together. ', 'Half of our team worked on the front-end web development while the other half worked on the back-end. The front-end team used HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP to develop the website. HTML was used to provide the basic layout of the website, by allowing us to create input fields so that we may take in necessary user information that would be crucial for matching people up. But because HTML is just essentially a markup language we had to add some features that allowed us to actually manipulate the data in a manner that would allow the back-end team to use said data, that’s where JS and PHP came in where JS is where we performed much of the formatting and error checking for inputs, and PHP is what would create the output file that the backend team would end up using. Once we had a bit more free time or whenever we felt stuck we took the time to try and make the website more presentable through the use of CSS and it’s styling features. The back-end team used a variety of programs to create the matchmaking and web-scraping software. We coded primarily in Python and used several libraries such as Selenium and Beautiful-Soup.  ', 'Many of us had to learn a bunch of items in a short period of time. The front-end team had to learn how to write to an adjacent file in order to communicate with our back-end. This ate a lot of our time because we had to learn PHP and AJAX, which neither one of our front-end developers had used before. The back-end team had to figure out how to use Selenium to be able to find a list of the top things to do in a certain location, according to the users’ interests. Our toughest challenge however, was finding a way to integrate front-end and back-end.

', ""We learned how to use a variety of languages, including HTML, CSS, JS, and libraries, including Selenium and beautiful-soup. This was a very meaningful learning experience as we can see ourselves utilizing the languages and libraries we learned in this hackathon to future projects. In addition, we also experienced personal growth in regards to overcoming challenges. What's nextIn the future, we hope to work on making our website global. Currently, it only serves those residing in the US, however, the scalability of our project is very plausible, and with just a little more research and time, we will be able to make it accessible worldwide. To add to the user experience, we will incorporate a calendar API to help our users plan out their travel days easier and get more advanced travel matches based on compatible schedules.

"FireWatch","A realtime wildfire visual recognition tool to facilitate fast and accurate response times","[3557, ""Every year, there are tens of thousands of wildfires in the United States destroying homes, displacing populations, and leaving acres of land in ruin. Efficient and accurate wildfire detection could detect these fires before they grow to uncontrollable levels. Wildfire detection largely relies on interaction to confirm or track the existence of the fire. This leads to inefficient, low coverage detection that isn't fast enough to get a response in a timely manner. We wanted to combine visual recognition machine learning to detect fires quickly, sending an alert to our custom built web application for first responders. This continuous, smart surveillance would be cheaper and provide higher coverage than the traditional alternatives. "", 'A visual recognition AI on the Google Coral uses machine learning to classify the image it reads off the device camera. When the devices detects a wildfire, it will communicate its presence to a database. A web application reads from the database and will alert users of the wildfire.

', 'The base of our technology is the Google Coral, a machine learning, single board computer that is able to run AI algorithm to classify images remotely. We created our algorithm using TensorFlow. The Coral is outfitted with a camera to take in realtime data of its visual surroundings and send out an alert to our Azure database when it detects a fire. The database is linked to the Coral using RedNode and Watson IOT to establish the data connections, format the Coral output, and send it to database. Once it reaches the database, the information connects to a .NET MVC web application. This UI will alert users of the fire and the location, facilitating a response.

"PetGet","As of today, there are numerous concepts for rescuing people from the wake of natural disasters, but no proposals have been made on how to rescue innocent pets. It's time to stand up for the underdog.","[3977, 'Our inspiration for this project stemmed from the various ideas on disaster relief.  After taking note on previous hackathon solutions as well as other various natural disaster relief applications, we noticed a common ground: every natural disaster mitigation proposal focused on rescuing the people, but nothing on rescuing the animals.  This is where our research began, and our findings were stunning.  According to California newsletter SF Gate, a small nonprofit called Kincade Fire Pet Rescue Reunification Group has been overseeing the rescue of pets from the recent California wildfires.  In order to make their efforts as efficient as possible, they report spending roughly 18 hours a day combing through numerous social media posts, calling missing pet owners, collecting photos, and more in order to even get an idea of where a missing pet may belong.  Other similar examples include Hurricane Katrina, where nearly 16,000 pets went missing, and only 15% ever made it home.  This is a very preventable problem, and by drawing more attention to the significance of pet loss by creating an innovative solution seemed more than necessary.  ', ""It starts with the owner.  If the owner finds their pet is missing due to a natural disaster or any other reason, they would use PetGet to fill out a description of their pet, an image, as well as their last known location.  After this form is completed, local law enforcement is notified, and a post to PetGet's website is created.  Then, other PetGet users can see the listings of missing pets, sorted by the proximity between the user and the pet's last known location.  If someone believes they have found a missing pet, they can look through the local posts and find the pet(s) that best match the description of the pet they found.  They would then notify the poster about the finding, and say the pet's current location after the pet was found, whether it be a shelter, a house, a veterinary hospital, etc.  The poster would go to this location and claim their pet.  The applications of this concept are especially useful for relief agencies/nonprofits, as they can find pets in distress at a much faster rate and they can locate the pet's owner quickly and easily, allowing for more pets to be saved and more owners to be reunited with their pets.  Even everyday bystanders or pedestrians can find missing pets, allowing for a broad network of people helping the cause of caring for the pets.

"SanAir","Fly Clean!","[6264, 'Cabin Cleanliness is the 6th most common area of concern for airline customers. Some of the preceding concerns are not within the scope of the airline to address, but the airlines have full responsibility when it comes to recognizing and correcting cleanliness concerns on-flight. Airplanes also serve as an unfortunate but effective means of spreading communicable disease from either passenger to passenger or from departure location to destination. ', ""UV-C light is used to destroy 99.999% of pathogens on tray tables when they are placed in the upright position between flights. UV-C light is also used to destroy 99.999% of pathogens in the on-flight water prior to dispensation before going through a final particulate filter to provide clean water for on-flight services. An app is also available for download where the customer can track information regarding the flight's water and air quality maintenance logs, with additional information pertaining to specific technologies implemented by SanAir on-flight and other general hygiene practices for the customer to consider. "", ""The app was designed using Swift and a model of the UV-C light was created in AutoDesk Fusion360. The 3D CAD model was designed with the intention to be realistic and practical for an airline while retaining the ability to be easily manufactured and readily implemented into new aircraft. A realistic 3D model of an aircraft seat demonstrating the function of the technology was established using both stock and custom parts. The CAD model has a fully animated worm gear system that is driven by a Nema 11 stepper motor. This allows an array of custom, short-beam UV-C LED's to shine over the entire surface of the tray as it is turned into the upright position. The purpose of the array's capacity to rotate is two-fold. It allows for a smaller amount of LED's to be required to reach the entire surface of the tray, and it also hides the surface of the lenses when the tray is in the open position. The latter prevents the passenger from tampering with  or accidentally damaging the UV-C lights during flight. A worm gear was chosen for mechanical advantage in the system. Worm gears provide improved torque and accuracy while being driven, and prevent the array from being rotated by an external force from a passenger. A limit switch was also included in the design that only allows the UV-C LED's to activate if the tray is in the upright position. After assessing the difficulties in maintaining clean water on an aircraft, lack of intervention in the water filtration system was noted to be a choke point in securing potable water on-flight. New filters will be instituted to aid current UV-C technology used by newer aircraft that kill pathogens along the water feed line. There is no current mechanism in place to ensure that the water remains potable after being deposited into the plane's water reserve once it passes through the first phase of UV-C technology in place. A UV-C system will be placed into the water system between storage and access of the water. Older planes without the current UV-C technology can also be retrofitted with the UV-C light at dispensation as well. An additional particulate filter using activated carbon will be added as an additional measure to remove other organic molecules and contaminants that pose health risks to passengers. "", 'A potential concern was discovered involving an untoward effect of UV-C light in which plastic degrades over time with UV-C exposure. Ionized/Vaporized Hydrogen Peroxide were also looked at for creating an automatic sterilization system in between flights, but the procedure with the current technology at the fastest takes 75 minutes to complete.

Therefore, we decided to combine them together - giving birth to Insight. "", '10 million acres of land a year is burnt due to forest fires, and this amount is increasing yearly by 15%. Which causes a downwards spiral of higher temperatures and dry condition for even more forest fires.And the only prevention or monitoring system for forest fires are fire lookouts and satellites. Lookouts are based around human eye sight which is unreliable because only after the fire spread to a degree where it can not be stopped can they see the fire. And satellites are updated on a weekly bases due to orbits and images may be distorted due to weather and cloud cover. These two options are unreliable and only usable when the fire is so large it can be seen over a large area.

"Bio-Inspired Multi-UAV for Wildlife Control on Runways","Developing an autonomous system for a safe and efficient dispersal of animals from runway using multiple UAVs which follow a novel bio-inspired algorithm","[5009, 'Wildlife strikes in airports are increasing year over year. Current precautionary methods involve a lot of human involvement and shooting of wildlife as a safety precautionary method. We felt a need for bringing autonomy to current methods in this field. The fact that the problem was very challenging inspired us more to work on this problem. ', 'We developed an algorithm for using Multiple UAVs for surveillance of the area and animal dispersal on and near airport runways. Higher-level control of decentralized multiple UAVs will cover the entire airport area by dividing the area into segments. During surveillance, if there is any animal movement, the UAVs detect that by using computer vision techniques. This information is sent into the network. Three of UAVs nearest to the animal collaborate and form a pattern such that they scares away animals and makes them disperse in the direction away from the runway and towards a specific trap. This logic is developed from wolves hunting patterns.  ', 'We divided the whole problem into two sub-problems. Detection of animals and Deterrence of animals post detection. Detection: The area of inspection needs to be covered periodically during the patrolling. Therefore, the entire area is divided into segments and we followed the sweep algorithm for area coverage in which one UAV monitors each segment. The algorithm is designed such that each point is inspected once in time, T. During its surveillance operation, if a UAV camera detects any animal movement it tags it and follows it. Deterrence: The second part of the problem is dispersing animals away from the runway. One method that is prevailing currently is shooting the animals that get on runways but this will not preserve wildlife. Therefore, in addressing this problem, we came up with a novel technique which is inspired by wolves hunting pattern. Cristina Muro in his paper on ""Wolf-pack (Canis lupus) hunting strategies emerge from simple rules in computational simulations"" mentioned how wolves form a pattern surrounding their prey animals for chasing them down. However, our technique is designed to disperse them away from the runway. UAVs form a shape around animals within a safe distance in such a manner that animals will have only one direction to escape.  These UAVs use high-frequency sounds or flashlights to disperse animals away from the runway. We simulated this behavior using MATLAB in which results are satisfying. ', 'Initially, the problem we choose looked simple, but when we went into details we came across many problems. The main challenge is finding logic for dispersing animals without having the need to shot them. Later, while coding the developed algorithm. It is hard to incorporate all the mechanisms of UAV after further literature review we came across behavior-based robotics which can be used for this scenario.

"A for Accessibility","Keep your lectures and seminars accessible and student-friendly with this educational application!","[5768, 'There is an increasing recognition of the need to make education more accessible to students with diverse needs. The government of Ontario, for example, passed the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act in 2005 [1]. Ontario’s universities have produced a set of guidelines to help instructors make their classes more accessible [2]. Recognizing this as a step in the right direction, we were inspired to make a tool that would give feedback to instructors about their lectures, allowing them to modify it to make sure their students’ needs are being met. ', 'A for Accessibility records the audio of an educator’s lectures and analyzes it using Google’s powerful Speech-To-Text and Natural Language APIs. This analysis includes a whole bunch of important metrics carefully crafted by leading educators in order to help teachers understand the impact of their lectures on students of all types [3]. These metrics focus on tracking things like WPM [4,5], phrase complexity [6,7], and topic focus. Once the analysis is complete, the metrics are returned to the educator along with helpful tips explaining why tracking things like WPM is important, and how they can improve future lectures to make their content more accessible. In addition to this, a transcript of the lecture is returned, with questions highlighted to help the educator track common questions and address them more permanently through email or a Learning Management System. ', 'A for Accessibility is a full-stack application with the frontend made with Nuxt.js and Vuetify.js, and the backend made with Flask in Python. For our database we chose to use MongoDB Atlas. Our backend is enhanced with Google’s Speech-To-Text and Natural Language APIs to provide the analysis of audio that is passed back from the frontend, with all the computation being performed in Python. Our system was deployed through Google’s App Engine service. ', 'Constructing a full-stack application with so many moving parts is never easy. Our biggest challenge was making sure all the individual components of our application worked together properly. Another big challenge was choosing the most important indicators for accessible lectures. The solution to this problem was just extensive research! After a lot of work we were able to establish a common baseline for the most important indicators, and craft thresholds and tips to actively help educators to meet these baselines. ', 'We are very proud of our seamless end-to-end processing of audio. From recording audio on the frontend, we can pass that audio to the backend, store it, and run a variety of analysis on the audio and resultant transcript.

', 'We have addressed the aural component of accessible teaching but any lecture can be made accessible along other dimensions as well. In the future we intend to implement a video recording of the lecture. By using machine learning tools we will analyze the video and provide feedback to the lecturer about how often they were facing students, how much they moved around in class, as well as other metrics that correspond to an accessible teaching style. Additionally, we plan on implementing a student facing service where they can submit written questions to the instructor during the lecture. The timing and topics of these questions would allow the lecturer to determine difficult areas in the lecture they need to revisit. This feature will be particularly helpful for larger classes where every student may not have the opportunity to ask questions.Repetition of the core themes of a lecture and contextualizing concepts with examples are key features of more accessible teaching. We plan to implement more rigorous content analysis of the lecture to allow us to automatically detect when a lecturer repeats a theme from the lecture or provides an example.References[1] https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/05a11[2] http://www.accessiblecampus.ca/tools-resources/educators-tool-kit/teaching-tips/creating-accessible-lectures/[3] Centre for Teaching Excellence, University of Waterloo, ""Lecturing Effectively in the University Classroom.""[4] Dale, Edgar, and Jeanne S.

', 'An increased number of passengers especially during the peak time period is a serious problem for airports because not all airports are designed to serve passengers beyond the threshold point which causes congestion and the number is expected to be on the rise over the coming years. Our goal is to explore ways to improve Customer Experience (CX) but still be profitable for both the airport and the airlines. Our focus areas are to enhance the travel experience from the moment the passenger booked his/her flight. This can be achieved by monitoring human behavior and communicating it in the right way to reduce congestion by using Machine Learning techniques. ', 'Better communication, accommodation, and compassion will greatly improve the Customer Experience. We aim to achieve this by equipping the airline company with a fleet of semi-autonomous vehicles that have the capability to scan the baggage and weigh it while kept in the boot of the car. This way, the passenger is alerted about the presence of banned stuff like more than 100ml of liquid, sharp objects which otherwise have to be thrown away by the TSA while screening. This might be heartbreaking when passengers have to throw away valuables when unknowingly packed into the luggage. With these semi-autonomous vehicles, the presence of these substances can give the passenger an option to return it to their pickup location.A multi-vehicle path planning algorithm schedules the order of pickup for multiple customers A MATLAB algorithm is used to schedule the pickup time for each passenger so that not all the passengers arrive at the same time to the airport This is achievable by a fee that a user can pay to arrive at a time closer to their flight departure time to avoid waiting at the airport for about 3 hours The airline personnel then sends a text to the passenger and the pickup time by the airline owned vehicle The passenger then loads their baggage into the trunk. Now, the passenger has the option to either check-in their baggage by themselves which has no fee or to opt for the enhanced passenger experience by paying a fee which speeds up their wait time at the airport cause the check-in would be done by the airline personnel as the weigh-in and baggage screening is done at the car itself Another solution to reduce congestion that we have implemented is by using a neural network to train the algorithm using a data set that has the data for ~20 hours of passenger entry and exit for every time period throughout the day. Once the algorithm is trained, it can predict the number of passengers at each time step for the next day.

"Flock","Hurricane Dorian took over sixty lives in the first two weeks. Our project will help these people when they need it the most and no one else can by quickly restoring communications following disasters","[4740, ""When doing research for already implemented solutions to solve communication restoration challenges for disaster sites we came across Google's solution, Project Loon, which restores LTE to large areas using weather balloons and satellite communications; however, it comes with a two week delay in response time. After further research, we realized that the first two weeks are the critical response window where matters are life and death for victims of the disaster. For example, during Hurricane Dorian over 60 people passed away in the first two weeks. It was incredibly apparent a tool for first responders needed to be created to aid people in need immediately after a disaster. "", ""Our solution will serve as the bridge between the disaster and when Project Loom can be deployed by providing a communication solution for the disaster site with at most a latency of 1 hour from flock deployment to when first responders get notified. This enables first responders to know exactly where the victims are, as well as, providing a message describing their current condition and how to get to them allowing responders to provide the critical life saving aid the victim's need. Furthermore, this solution will forward any text message out of the effected areas that a victim would want to send. "", ""We built this by creating a cross platform mobile app that anyone with WiFi can utilize. A victim can queue messages to be sent in this app stating whether or not the message is an emergency notification to responders or just a normal text message. When the first responders arrive on scene they select the effected area on a map and deploy a flock of completely autonomous drones that fly in a grid like pattern to collect these messages from the victims. Next, when a communication drone flies over the affected area the queued messages are automatically transmitted to the drone via it's wireless access point and stored on the drone's internal cache. Once the drones finish their patrol they fly back to the first responder who loads the messages onto their computer using our custom made application where messages are parsed dropping pings onto a map so first responders know the state of the victim and their precise location, and forwards the text messages to the given phone number via a satellite internet connection on the first responders computer. "", ""Developing the algorithm the autonomous drone flock uses to patrol an effected area making sure to keep the distance to the patrol site, the size of the patrol site, the current battery percentage, the speed they need to fly at in order to collect the messages, etc in mind. Developing the application that sits on a Raspberry Pi, as well as, configuring a Raspberry Pi to automatically pick up messages from the mobile application on the WiFi enabled devices.

However, after getting started, we realized that there wasn't much documentation online for generating (or detecting) haikus from Javascript code, so one of our biggest challenges was creating that algorithm from the ground up. On the front end, our main challenge was fine-tuning the Web Speech API to work exactly as we wanted, and creating a great UI that isn't too over-the-top or overwhelming for the user.

"D.O.O.M.B.A.","An open source flexible robot arm for the development and implementation on various platforms. From robots that spread butter to minimally invasive surgical devices, the D.O.O.M.B.A. has many uses!","[5003, 'Today, most robot arms operate with several rigid linkages and servos moving them. What if they were not limited by these inflexible linkages and could move more similarly to a tentacle? They could be used for a number of novel applications, from fishing clogs out of drains to saving lives by assisting surgeons in minimally invasive surgery. The idea behind the D.O.O.M.B.A. is to develop an extremely flexible open source robot arm that can eventually become applicable in these situations. ', 'D.O.O.M.B.A. uses three servo motors with strings attached to pull a central spring to the desired position. Commands are sent from a computer to the system to control the speed and position of the arm. ', 'To start, the electrical system was assembled and the motors were tested. A laptop power supply was purchased to provide power to the motors and modified such that it could connect to the Arduino CNC shield. Wood for the frame was marked, cut, drilled and assembled. Next, the electronics were attached to the frame, spools were cut from a dowel rod, and affixed them to the servos. Nylon washers were drilled such that the string would pass through them and that they would fit tightly on the spring. Finally these washers were put onto the spring, string was run through them, and the spring was set in place. ', 'We ran into many challenges making this robot arm, but the main ones involved some interesting design limitations and hardware problems. The first of which was the need for a spool for the string, which was something we overlooked. We fixed this by building spools from scratch using a wooden dowel. Furthermore, we ran into some programming errors which were especially hard to debug because the software had almost no error information other than an error existed. To solve this, we went through the start up operation and checked the settings, making sure each bit was the value we needed and did some internet digging to make sure we had the right values to achieve our goal. Another problem was that we had no power supply that would fit our CNC shield. We solved this issue by buying a computer power supply and using a paperclip as the new prongs to connect the supply to the shield. We added heat shrink to give some insulation and keep the paperclip from touching itself, which when tested worked perfectly. The last big problem we had was not being able to hold the servos in a single position so that we could get the arm to hold its position. To solve this we had to set a specific field to all 1’s, which allowed the servos to be constantly fed power so that they could hold their position. ', 'At the end of this, we are happy to say we have achieved our goal of creating a truly flexible robot arm from open-source parts. It may not be quite ready for surgery, but it is a significant step in the right direction! The interface is intuitive, all parts are easily replaceable, and the arm works as intended which is wonderful. ', 'Over the weekend we learned about and improved our skills in a variety of areas including arduino, circuits, gcode, and the physical side of building the frame, arm, and joints. The kit we used was an arduino cnc kit, which used gcode an all new language that allows the programmer to give instructions to the three servos to go in three directions, X, Y, and Z. In order to work with the hardware we needed to learn more and brush up on our embedded systems skills when we had to deal with setting flags for certain pieces of functionality we wanted. Some group members also got some new experience working with hardware and circuits for the first time by helping wire everything up. ', 'The next steps for D.O.O.M.B.A. would be adding in a more natural way of controlling it our initial ideas were with potentiometers or a joystick. We would also need a better cooling system so we can go for longer periods of time before we have to cool off the board, and a more improved hardware control scheme to give more range of motion/precision to the arm.

"I'm Hungry!!","Restaurant recommendations using Collaborative Filtering with Fast.ai","[3402, ""We started off the hackathon weekend by taking a look at NCR's APIs available. We were particularly interested in NCR's Site APIs and Silver POS APIs, which is able to give us data such as nearby restaurants, restaurant items, etc. We also came to this hackathon with the intent of incorporating some aspect of Machine Learning into our project.  "", ""I'm Hungry is an app which primarily recommends suitable restaurants for users in their proximity. We trained a model using collaborative filtering built with neural networks that allowed us to make predictions of ratings based on all users' past reviews. Using this model, we can make accurate predictions about the user's preferences for restaurants. After receiving a recommendation, a user is then able to easily make reservations at the specified restaurant in his/her proximity.  "", 'The web frontend was built using ReactJS. It is hosted on Google Cloud App Engine with a custom domain.com domain. Collaborative filtering models were built with Fast.ai. We decided to host our model on an online RESTful API hosted on Microsoft Azure running on Flask using Python. ', ""We wanted to base our model on features obtained from user written reviews for the various restaurants. However, NCR's Site APIs only gave us a small sample of these restaurants, we thought that it would not be as interesting to run our model just on those few samples. Upon consulting one of the NCR staff, we were told that we could base our data on what would be obtained from NCR's APIs, and not necessarily have to use them. With this, we decided to use data from yelp.com which had tons of restaurant and review data for us to work on. Another challenge was the fact that all of us were not familiar with collaborative filtering (one reason why we wanted to involve Machine Learning in our project was to learn more about it!). We spent many hours just reading articles and trying to figure out how it works before we were even able to start coding. "", ""Training and implementing the model was not an easy task for us. We spent many hours just trying to configure the code and getting it to run and train properly. Furthermore with the large dataset, it took some time to clean and process the data before we can even start training the model.

"Liqui3D (Game of DEXes)","FOMO3D x Liquidity Mining","[5169, 'Inspired by the ""War of Attrition"" game behind FOMO3D, we built Liqui3D to allow for the bottom-up emergence of liquidity, particularly among less popular cryptoasset pairs that fall in the long-tail of all traded cryptoasset pairs on a DEX.ProtocolGame startMultiple players place trades of a given trading pair (like ETH-BTC, DOGE-ETH). The transaction fees - typically a percentage of the traded amount - associated with their trades are collected in the pot. In the beginning, the POT contains the sum of all transaction fees from all players who have placed trades of this specific trading pair. Depending on how big is your order and how liquid this trading pair is, there will be some transaction fees.The transaction fees is directly proportional to the amount being tradedThe transaction fees is inversely proportional to the liquidity of the trading pair. For example, the initial transaction fee is 1%, if only 10 trades happened in the last 5 mins, we are going to increase the transaction fee, because traders would be willing to pay a little more to make the trade happen faster.If the trading pair is very popular, like ETH/BTC, the transaction fee will be very low, because there is no need to increase liquidity at this point. The POT smart contract details the amount of transaction fees that belongs to each player. A portion of the Amount in POT continuously remains in the POT, and the remaining portion of it is given as a contribution to the global lottery pool. Game TimerThe countdown will start after a certain pot size. The init countdown is 1 minute. When any trade happens, the countdown timer will accumulate a little more time. The max countdown time is 1 hour. If there is no trade happen when the countdown comes to 0, this round ends.24 hour periodic redistribution: Local weighted lotteryThe trading transaction fees collected from all players is pooled into the local_lottery_pool. 10% of the cumulative amount from the pot gets assigned as the lottery_prize. Every 24 hours, one player out of all the existing players is randomly chosen. The chosen player wins the lottery_prize. The likelihood of winning is proportional to the player’s relative contributions to the pot. i.e. the amount of transaction fees they contributed to the pot cumulatively.P(Player1 wins) = (Player1\'s total contributions to the POT) / (Total amount in POT)Justification for local lottery vs. global lotteryA global lottery would motivate players to create new esoteric shitcoins, just so they would have a greater likelihood of winning the global lottery. By protocol, esoteric shitcoin pairs would be assigned higher transaction fees, thus building a larger pot relative to the amount being traded. A larger pot would mean the probability of winning the global lottery is higher too. Thus, global lotteries indirectly encourage the creation of new esoteric shitcoins.Justification for allocating portion of cumulative amount in POT vs. portion of trades placed in the last 24 hoursIntroducing such temporal nuances may give room for the development of attack vectors related to time of order placement. One such scenario would be when multiple players agree via an external side contract to all place their orders on the same day, such that they pump up the local_lottery_pool for the upcoming lottery. A player would agree to such a contract with the incentive being saving on opportunity cost, or effort (i.e. akin to laziness, you’d rather place a high volume of trades on the same day and take the next day off). This would drive game dynamics to entertain short spans of high trading volumes, which is undesirable as we want continuous and consistently high volumes of liquidity through time. End of gameWhen round ends, the last person who made the trade will take 50% of the pot, the 25% of the pot money goes back to the participants, the last 25% goes to the next round.If the game just goes on forever, at some point, we will distribute some of the pot money back to the participants.Next StepsValidate protocol design decisions via a multi-agent simulationBuilt WithcosmosgoreacttypescriptTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    DeFi HackathonWinner                Tendermint Cosmos Challenge              Winner                Best Project - Grand Prize                  Created by  I had a dream on Friday night and came up with this idea of Liqui3D...

Due to this, he, as well as the rest of the team, was exposed to the vast amount of greenhouse gas emission caused by the current food industry, with emphasis on the meat industry.  Seeing an opportunity to be able to help protect the Earth from greenhouse gas pollution, the team cam up with the idea of Leaf. ', 'The objective of Leaf is to promote and assist users in eating in a way that is both healthier for them and the planet. A user can enter a recipe into the app and the app will then evaluate the environmental impact of the recipe. Impact on the environment is calculated by comparing the quantity of the ingredient called for in the recipe and comparing it to the average greenhouse gas emission for processing and packaging that ingredient. The value of greenhouse emissions used to generate that amount of ingredient in the recipe is then returned to the user. This process is completed for each ingredient in the recipe and then the sum of the greenhouse gas generated by the recipe is shown to the user. Once the user is notified of the impact that their recipe has, possible substitutions can be shown for the recipe that would decrease its carbon footprint. Overall, Leaf will allow for people to make healthier food lifestyle choices by helping ease users into a more sustainable, vegetarian inspired diet. Additionally, with these lifestyle changes comes a lessened carbon footprint by finding foods that are less damaging to the environment during their production. ', 'Initial data compiling and organization was done with Python. This included using a basic web crawler to acquire pricing, food, and environmental impact data.  Additionally, this data was then converted into usable .json files to be used in the final project. Once this was completed, the back-end and front-end were constructed. To manage the dataset we compiled, we utilized a local MySQL relational database to store the information in a handful of tables. From there we set up a Spring server using Maven to create an API to access and manipulate the data from the database. Functionalities include user management and querying the database of green house gas emission records for common food options. The client side application was written for Android and features a clean, tabbed GUI. Each tab corresponds to a major function of the application. These include the home, where carbon emission statistics about the user can be observed, the ingredient replacement tab, where ingredients can be swapped out for cleaner alternatives, the recipes section, where a carbon emission score is calculated using calls to the back-end to process the food in question and finally the profile, where user settings can be found. The application features the full-stack and takes advantage of remote processing for determining clean food alternatives as well as storing user data. ', 'One of the biggest challenges we faced was when we went to connect the front-end and back-end of our app. A majority of this was due to various issues while making volley requests. One issue was syntax mismatches between the front-end and back-end which were difficult to locate, causing errors to arise when running our code. An example of this was that each end had the correct objects and attributes in the request, there were slight nomenclature issues that resulted in failure of our volley requests despite it being a subtle issue. ', 'We are most proud of the fact that we were able to complete a full stack project in only 36 hours. Our team has also learned many new skills over the course of this competition; this is another accomplishment that we are proud of. ', ""All of the team members were able to learn a new skill at this year's competition.  Matt learned how to create a web crawler that is able to take prices, names, and image URLs off of an online shopping website. In addition, he learned the basics of app development by assisting and watching team members. Sam learned how to set up both a MySQL server for a database and a Spring Boot server from scratch to create the back-end.  Jeff learned a lot about how to utilize volley and get requests to create communication between the front-end and back-end as well as the nuances of Android Studio. "", 'Once the 36 hour project version of Leaf concludes, a plethora of possible expansions are available. The ability to track how much greenhouse gas meals produce every week will be implemented and the user will also be able to set goals for emissions each week. In addition, a taste profile can be implemented which will allow for the user to indicate whether they prefer alternate meat, vegetarian, or vegan substitutions to be made into their recipes. This preference feature can also be used in order to accommodate food allergies and make recipe suggestions regarding them. Expanding beyond dietary choices and restrictions, users may choose a few favorite ingredients and have Eco-friendly recipes given to them including the ingredient(s) as a daily recipe suggestion. A final feature that the team will implement is sourcing substitutions for recipes. Once substitutions are displayed to the user, the suggestions may be clicked on to show more information.

We used this data in Google Cloud Platform's Vision service to create a custom AI model that can recognize whether a satellite image has been affected by a disaster. With this model trained, we set up a location search. This search uses US census data to determine population density for a given area.

"IDetector","Use the easy, friendly and free eye tracker to create friendly user interface using just your eyes gestures ","[3702, ""With the ever rising number of computer users, the accessibility of computers is still, to a great extent, limited to the use of traditional keyboard inputs. So, using computers for people with disabilities is either quite expensive or an unpleasant experience. We wanted to build an application that could use gestures to perform tasks without using any expensive additional tools.What It DoesThe application user your eyes gesture(more particularly your blink gesture) to perform a task in the computer. In this particular case, we will use our simple flappy bird style game called TonyHops to show the use of such a feature. A user can control the motion of the character just by blinking their eyes and thus would be great for people who are unable to use their arms. Besides, our game, the IDetector also works great with the T-Rex game from google.    How I Built itOur application uses pythons openCV library to take live feed from the users’ webcam. Then we implement the dlib library to track their facial structure. We then use a shape predictor file provided by dlib that can be used with the predictor functions in dlib library to accurately track the users eyes. Then measuring the width to height ratio of the eyes, our program makes an accurate prediction of, if the user blinked his eye. On detecting a blink, the program performs a key press(in our case the space button) which allows you to perform a certain task. The key press can be modified depending on the need of the user.Challenges I ran intoI think the biggest challenge for us was trying to run multiprocessing in python. Since playing the game requires information from the webcam feed and running the game at the same time we needed to implement multiprocessing in our program. However, we ran into a lot of errors while trying to do this. This error definitely cost our team a lot of valuable time.Accomplishments that I'm proud ofThis was the first Hackathon for our team.

We also got into simple game development with python which was a fun experience for everybody. Using Tkinter library to make GUI for python was also a new experience for us.What next for IDectetorIDetector is capable of so much more with just some timy modifications.

"I Desire Apple Pie","Constellations, Space, VR, and Neural Networks, Oh my!","[4947, 'Since the beginning of time, mankind has looked to the stars for inspiration, often leading to some of the greatest scientific and mathematical discoveries to date. Kepler, Newton, Laplace, Lagrange, and Einstein are all commonplace names in every classroom, but many would be surprised to know that their motivation for making some of the greatest advances in science and technology were born out of a desire to understand our universe and the laws that govern it. Soon, mankind will begin the efforts of colonizing other planets, and the thirst for discovery will be quenched once again. This project was born out of curiosity for what life will be like once humanity makes that step. What will we see when we look up from other planets? We wanted a way to visualize 3D space and explore the stars and constellations in a way they had not been seen before. This, coupled with the VandyHacks theme to create a work of art, led us to build the first Martian art Gallery. As Carl Sagan once said: “If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe”. ', 'A Virtual Reality experience that transports the user to an art exhibition on the Martian surface. Exhibits range from sculpture, to monuments, to 3D constellation models. The sky is made with real-time star mapping that represents what the actual night sky will look like when future Martians look to the stars. The size and brightness of each star directly correlates with the distance the star is from our Solar System and its Flux value. The simulation features narration by a neural network version of Carl Sagan, who teaches the user about a variety of concepts that will be crucial to the future of humanity living outside of the Earth system, as well as offbeat facts about some of the celestial bodies that make up many of the worlds favorite constellations. ', 'The Virtual Reality simulation was built using Unreal Engine and Oculus hardware, as well as real-time voice synthesis with small data sets, image hyper resolution neural network trained primarily on 2D data sets used to enhance textures provided by NASA and Poliigon, and style transfer with neutral network to make neat art.The star mapping was created by utilizing SPICE Kernels, ephemeris data which determines the precise location of celestial bodies in space depending on a user-defined epoch and reference frame; and Python programming. Python packages used include Spiceypy, Skyfield, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Bpy to interface the code with Blender. SPICE Kernels used include de430, naif0008, and the Hipparcos star catalog, among many others. ', 'Simultaneously running out of VRAM, RAM, GPU, and CPU power; and two complete computer crashes which resulted in file corruption. Additionally, migrating assets from Blender to Unreal Engine and finding ways to interface between all the different project segments proved to be much more difficult than previously anticipated.On the celestial mechanics side, determining the necessary SPICE Kernels required to view bodies from the Mars Barycenter, proper coordinate transformations to convert from the spherical coordinates used in the celestial models to the cartesian coordinates used by Blender and Unreal Engine was tricky to properly align, and determining how to automate the process of building spheres within Blender that correctly correspond to the size and location of stars making up various constellations. ', 'The overall aesthetic of the simulation came out great.

"Hotpot","A positive-sum smart-contract that gamifies saving ","[3584, 'Inspired by a common Chinese rotational lending game called “和会“, meaning “Rotating Credit and Savings Association (ROSCA)"" (these can also be called a \'susu\' or \'tanda\') , which is made of a group of close friends or family members. They pool their money into a common fund, generally structured around monthly contributions, and a single member withdraws the money from it as a lump sum at the beginning of each cycle. The game is heavily reliant on the trust and relationship among members because there is no central authority recording or implementing the transactions. We were also aware that many studies have shown that people are more likely to save if savings are presented in a lottery style. For example, it may be hard for someone to put aside $100 to save, but they are willing to spend that for a 1 in 6 chance at $600 which is analogous to joining a 1 month long, $100 susu (where they would be expected to win $600 twice a year).We also realized that we also had the opportunity to make this a positive-sum game by investing the pot while it is waiting to be paid out. After running some Monte Carlo simulations, we found that the average user will get paid out more than they put in, especially if they join many Susu\'s.Therefore, we decided to put this game on blockchain using a slightly modified version. Instead of one single member withdrawing the sum, we put the sum in the compound interest pool for a certain amount of time and then distribute the larger sum to a few players who win a lottery.

"SyncFast","Effectively create, share, and access presentations from the cloud","[6805, 'We understand the importance of a strong education and have seen countless newspaper articles, statistics and pictures detailing the lack of materials in third world countries. Many of the lower class children that live in poorer countries cannot receive a good education because their school cannot afford technologies such as projectors to enhance the material. Surprisingly, however, statistics show that a large majority of the world population, rich or poor, owns a smartphone. However, the current schooling system has no way to integrate this technology in teaching. In an era where exchange of data holds an infinite value, it is vital for everyone to have access to our vast technological resources. We wanted to build a system that is not only convenient for people like us to easily and quickly make and share presentation, but also build a system that allows those in underprivileged communities that cannot afford laptops or iPads to utilize their smartphones to easily access information shared by their teacher.  ', 'Our system consists of four distinct components. The website is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and gives admin users the option to create or host a presentation. To host a presentation, they connect their Google Drive account and import their presentation, where each slide is converted to a PNG file and sent to a centralized Firebase Database. The iOS app is written in Swift, Objective-C and Ruby and allows client side users to access shared presentations. They are presented with an enter code page, where they can either scan an RFID tag or input a unique authentication key. Once they are verified, they are presented with a live PNG image of the presentation pulled from the Firebase Database that updates immediately after an admin update. Another core functionality of the website is the create presentation, which uses webkit Speech-to-Text libraries and natural language processing to build a brand new presentation for you. Based on recognized speech patterns, you can add text bullets, add graphs, add images, remove bullets, import online information, etc. Lastly, a C++ based Arduino program allows client side iOS app users to easily enter presentation. By utilizing an RFID reader and HM-10 Bluetooth chip, RFID tags can be scanned and sent to the iPhone, where it is mapped to the authentication key. A user is presented feedback from a LCD, an LED, and a buzzer. ', ""We built the iOS app using Swift, Objective-C and Ruby on the XCode IDE. The app was built to support bluetooth connection to the Arduino hardware and WiFi connection to the central Firebase Database. Both base64 encoded and URL images were displayed by the app to the user. The website for creating and hosting presentations was built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. When a user created a presentation, BCrypt encryption standards were used to ensure maximum security in logins and data transfers. Flickr API, webkit Speech-to-Text and CanvasJS were used to provide basic presentation functionality. The hardware was coded in C++ on Arduino IDE. An Arduino Mega 2560, MFRC522 RFID Reader, HM-10 Bluetooth chip, 16x2 LCD, RGB LED, and buzzer were utilized for functionality. The Firebase Database served as the central cloud structure and integrated each component of our system with one another. The database stored each presentations' current slide URL as a PNG image, thus allowing users to view the current slide without a live stream, reducing bandwidth usage. By ensuring that each component was connected in a secure IoT system, we are able to provide a seamless and multi-platform system for users and admins to utilize. "", 'Our major issue was passing images to the Firebase Database during presentation creation. We had no problem converting premade Google Slides presentations into PNG images, but because our presentation creation interface was written straight in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, we were not able to effectively capture all elements (header, text, images, graphs) into a single images. To work around this, we saved two images and overlapped them to create the original. The base image contained the text in the slide and was base64 encoded and the secondary image contained the image in URL form. While this made our app slightly inefficient, this allowed users to view all aspects of the presentation while still reducing bandwidth usage.

"CalSAAS    ","A platform for connecting requesters and volunteers with a workflow pipeline and NLP integration","[4025, 'Sewa US along with Vyasa Houston & Yoga Bharati run an initiative to improve public health and provide help during disasters. They usually get requests for volunteers and as per requirements, they reach out to their registered volunteers. The problem they are facing currently is that the communication between Sewa US and volunteers is completely manual. They send out messages to their volunteers but there is no mechanism to manage the response. Also, there is no standard way of registering a volunteer or requester. Our idea is to create a common platform where all requests and volunteer assignments can be managed seamlessly with a workflow pipeline. ', ""We have built a framework to capture new requests by using the Telegram messenger in addition to the website. The chatbot gets all the details from the requester regarding their requirements and analyses the urgency status of the request using Sentiment Analysis using Artificial Intelligence. Each ticket has a field for the category which can be Disaster Management, Family Services, Volunteer Events. This request is then uploaded as a unique ticket on Trello. Each ticket flows through 4 stages: Backlog, Awaiting Approval, In Progress, Completed. A new ticket stays in the Backlog stage unless it is assigned to the volunteer. If it's a 'Family Services' request then the ticket has to go through an additional 'Awaiting Approval' stage. The next step is to broadcast messages to the volunteers added in our database based on their location and the requester's location. We have built an algorithm that keeps track of the volunteer's response and the requirement and accordingly expands its radius of location for broadcasting messages to volunteers. In order to avoid the bystander effect, we have added customized buttons to capture responses from the volunteers so that the messages are not buried down. After the volunteer requirements are fulfilled, the ticket moves to the 'In Progress' stage. This is the stage where the requester and volunteers are connected. We keep track of the progress of the task and the ticket is moved to the 'Completed' stage. We have also built a dashboard for the admin to track all the requests and their stages. We are proud of our live Maps to check the volunteers around a given radius. Our onboarding of volunteers is also backward compatible ie a simple csv upload of the existing dataset of volunteers will get them added to the database. "", 'Our chatbot works in Telegram messenger using their core APIs. We use a sentiment analyzer to understand the urgency level of the request. The responses in the messenger along with the urgency status classification are communicated to Trello using their APIs. We have used Leaflet to track volunteers and requests on the Maps.

"Weather Gecko","Gives the user a score for different activities, that could affect assets under your Geico insurance coverage, using AccuWeather API weather data.","[6164, ""As we were browsing the challenges for this semesters hackathon, we stumbled across Geico's challenge. It's goal is to bring an activity score to different activities that have something to do with the different insurance plans that Geico has. We thought this would be interesting since relating the weather to a risk factor is something we all subconsciously do when we ask for the weather in the morning, and having something to quantify it in a more specific manner sounded interesting. "", 'We thought this would be a great time to try out AccuWeather APIs to relate various weather conditions and warnings to make the score for these activities. We uses the AccuWeather APIs to gather a multitude of weather data that could give a score for some of the Geico insurance types. This combination of weather data and info on the insurance plans were put into custom functions that quantify a final score for each activity. ', ""We started off by splitting into two teams, one to understand how to use the AccuWeather API for our data collecting, and the other to figure out what data from the API had an impact on the different Geico Insurance Policies. For both of these purposes we chose to start out with Java.AccuWeatherOnce we had the understanding and initial implementation of the API, we began learning how to ping the AccuWeather site for our data and store it as usable variables in Java. We settled on using the Location, Forecast, Current Conditions, and Weather Alerts API's from AccuWeather. CalculationsMeanwhile, the other team was listing the measurements each insurance plan was affected by. Using these values, we created equations that deducted points from the max of 100 to get a final score for each insurance type. The points were subtracted based on the severity of the weather conditions. The insurance plans we settled on were Automotive, Motorcycle/ATV, Wellness and Fitness, Boating, and Air Travel. WebsiteOnce both of these were completed, we added in the data and equations to get our final values in Java. These final values were calculated on the GlassFish server via a Java Bean using a portion of the javax library. The Java Bean acts as a consolidator for all the data from the different API's.The results are then displayed to the customer on our mock Geico website. The first page prompts the user to enter their zip code and gives them a short description of the site. The Second page gives the scores for each of the insurance types and the risks of participating in those types of activities (ex. Car Travel, Boating, etc.). The Third and final page shows a breakdown of the weather conditions for someone who is also interested in the details. "", ""The largest challenge that we ran into when tackling this project was properly writing the network code in order to access the AccuWeather API. We encountered a few issues where our API key appeared to be acting up even though our request URL appeared to be correct. This resulted in us spending the first few hours trying to get any sort of response from the API. But once we got data out of the API, we weren't out of the woods yet. We still needed to take the data and manipulate it into a form we could use. We spend a considerable amount of time browsing Java libraries to find the best way to turn our data into something usable in our project plan.Another big challenge we ran into was the creation of the scales for each activity. A lot of the activities used some similar data sets but they all had their own specializations that we had to work around. The team had to come together and brainstorm/search for the danger zones of things such as temperature and precipitation. With these thresholds, we then created equations from the scores by using the data affecting the attribute of weather at maximum conditions, and equating that to a maximum score deduction (100). With this we had scaling equations for each of the weather equations. "", 'One of the things we are proud of is how quickly we got on task. Once we decided on a topic, we switched into high gear and got a lot of the groundwork started very quickly and efficiently. Because of this quick startup, it made the rest of the project when we came together and connected the two halves more manageable.Another thing we are proud of is our organization and steps we took to properly choose which weather conditions affected which of the insurance plans. This also led into creating all of our equations for the final activity ratings which, even though they were challenging, they are something that really shaped the outcome of this project.

We also got to learn about how to talk with a data center (AccuWeather) through the internet and ping it for data.

"Braven career connect","A backend system and UI platform to connect students with career goals to professionals in those fields at a mock interview event","[6694, 'Most of us in the team are graduate students and we totally understand how important it is for students to be prepared for interviews. Getting valuable feedback from industry professionals and identifying areas to improve is incredibly important for students beginning their careers.Braven is an inspiring organization that teaches students how to pursue their career goals. The number of students they teach has been rapidly growing in the past year, and they need to update their processes to handle this expansion. One of the challenges they face is running their mock interview events. These events are an opportunity for students to get valuable time with industry experts and practice their interview skills. Braven needs an efficient way to map students to interviewers with the same interests and skillsets for mock interviews. We resonate with this idea and intend to contribute in the best ways we can.Current ProcessIn the way the system works today, the people at Braven must individually collect updated interests and skillsets from each student via email. Then they match each student with two unique interviewers, ensuring that the interviewer is scheduled to have only one student for each time slot. While this process was reasonable when they were managing fewer students and professionals, this is not a scalable solution. ', 'Our solution attempts to streamline the interviewee and interviewer mapping process in order to make it efficient and scalable. The current approach is manual and tedious in terms of time and effort. We are providing the following features:A mobile-friendly app for students to register for upcoming events based on career interests.A friendly user-interface for volunteers to mark their availability for upcoming events based on career interests.The web interfaces contain the profile info section which will capture the interests of both students and volunteers.Recommender system which will map the students with volunteers based on career interests.Event matcher logic for checking if the volunteer is available for the event or not.New career interests can be accommodated by re-training the recommender model.Scalable solution hosted on the AWS cloud.Dashboards showing statistics on number of interviews candidates attended, upcoming event slots.

"", ""While we accomplished a lot during this Hackathon, there is more we would like to add in the future. We have some great ideas on Natural Language Processing regarding extraction of career interests from user-profiles, connecting the front end to more information on the backend that will reduce the work of the people at Braven and give a better experience for students and professionals.Event recommendation: Based on students' and volunteers' past history, we can gather data on similar users and recommend events for students and volunteers with similar interests.Based on users' information on career interests in the profile section, we can extract the skillset from both students' and volunteers' profiles. We can apply natural language processing (named entity recognition) and auto-fill their career interests. This would further help in increasing the accuracy of the interviewer to interviewee mapping.

"Diversify","Image-to-image translation for improved dataset diversity","[3610, ""Neural networks are powerful computer vision techniques which can map one image to another.  However, they are so effective that a new problem is rising; models are sensitive to image intensity heterogeneity.  One such example are computer vision systems which fail to operate over images of people of color, women, or those with non-traditional hair colors.The issue of neural network failure on these images lies in the dataset, as such models only will learn what they are given.  That is, the lack of diversity in machine learning datasets leads to neural networks that only make decisions based on that data.  If a neural network trains on a dataset in which all minorities are labeled as criminals, for example, then the neural network will overfit to this data and learn this mapping.  This is obviously undesirable and has heavy ethical consequences.StarGAN is a convolutional neural network model which permits style transfer from one set of categories to another set of categories.  Its ability to change a person's face, hair, age, and skin color can be a first step forward towards improving diversity in already existent datasets.  In tandem, we hope that data houses will strive to collect data which is more properly representative of the diversity we have on this planet.

"Victor CX","Auditory CUI for visually impaired or differently-abled users","[7758, ""There are an estimated 36 million blind and 217 million people worldwide with severe visual impairments. This represents a significant potential customer base that is currently being underserved by products and services that rely on a visual medium like web pages and visual devices like touch screens on smartphones for customer communication, information, and support. The experience of these users with products and services delivered through computing devices that have mice or touchscreens as the primary input method will always be more difficult than sighted users. People who are blind or visually impaired or disabled stood to benefit the most from the computer and information revolution and the explosion of hardware devices and mobile computer form-factors. But for these people reality has fallen far-short of expectations. It is true that GUI operating environments like Windows and MacOS and Android, and document formats like HTML and PDF have made huge strides in being accessible to visually impaired and disabled users. But user interfaces today still make fundamental assumptions about the medium of presentation of information and the mode of interaction with users, which can make using desktop or Web applications and forms or documents frustrating and time-consuming for sight-impaired users. GUI applications may conform to desktop accessibility guidelines and web-sites and pages and documents may follow recommendations like WCAG and ARIA. But navigation through desktop and web applications is still spatially oriented and visual users can see and immediately rank in importance navigation elements like windows, menus, trees, buttons, et.al while using a visual input marker like a mouse cursor to select the desired element or content. Information like calendars or tables or forms when presented visually use the visual layout as an important part of the meaning, Non-visual users who rely on screen-readers must often wade through a sea of elements and text before finding the desired function or content, and must rely on trial-and-error, repetition, and memory to be able to efficiently navigate a GUI. The increasing complexity of desktop and mobile GUIs today may benefit and seem intuitive to experienced visual users, but can also leave non-visual or differently-abled users far worse off than older interfaces. Today's complex GUIs make assumptions about the sight acuity or dexterity or short-term information processing abilities of users that can end up excluding a significant proportion of users or potential customers.Conversational user interfaces are among the easiest and most accessible forms of human-computer interaction and have seen a revival today on desktop and mobile devices powered by sophisticated natural language understanding and machine learning services running in the cloud. But most chatbots and CUIs today assume that the user can see the active conversation or activity or skill on-screen and can easily navigate and click on buttons or windows or other widgets when needed. CUIs today used to access  information like customer service may simply act as a director to web pages that are still heavily dependent on the assumption of a visual medium for presentation of information. For visually impaired users, a web pages may cause a screen reader to flood the user with information with no way to filter or narrow down what the user needs actually needs.To adequately serve the millions of blind and visually-impaired potential customers, organizations need to look beyond mere accessibility into truly inclusive interfaces that cater directly to the strengths and weaknessess of non-visual users.  Auditory user interfaces, like Emacspeak and other work pioneered by T.V. Raman can fundamentally change the customer experience for millions of non-visual users and businesses investing in this technology may find an untapped market for their products and services and a real source of brand and customer loyalty.  "", ""Victor CX is a client-server system which provides a multi-modal conversational user interface client and server back-end for interacting with an organisation's online services like product registration and on-boarding, product documentation, customer service and support, business processes like applying for a loan or for admission to a school, and other customer experience applications that traditionally rely on a user's ability to navigate a GUI and visual presentation of documents and forms. Victor CX is specifically designed for users who are blind or sight-impaired or who are otherwise not able to effectively use a traditional GUI with mouse input, and must rely on assistive technologies like screen-readers or braille displays. It uses a simplified, conversation-driven interface that can run either on a character-based terminal or in a browser as a web application. Victor produces line-by-line output that is easily read by screen readers and line-driven interactive input that can be easily entered via any kind of keyboard or character input device, or via speech recognition for users who cannot use such devices.The backend consists of a scalable chatbot server which contains the CUI logic for different bots and tracks and persists the conversation state for each client interaction witha bot, as well as as a web API which is called by CUI bots to retrieve content or run operations or interact with an organizations existing services.Victor CX let's organizations create auditory user interfaces for customer experience that integrate with existing business processes and services and content and which alsosatisfy the 7 inclusive design principlesProvide comparable experienceConsider situationBe consistentGive controlOffer choicePrioritise contentAdd valueVictor CX provides a 100% open-source alternative to proprietary CUI services like Google's Dialogflow, Microsoft's LUIS, wit.al, et.al.

"FINALIST: CatchUp!","Rekindling old friendships doesn't have to be awkward or time-consuming. CatchUp! is a productivity app that streamlines the reach-out process with efficient, ready-made conversation starters.","[4457, ""Making new friends as an adult isn’t easy. But trying to reconnect with an old friend can be even more challenging—especially if you haven’t spoken in years. Even though many people desperately want to revive old friendships, they rarely take the chance to do so because of miscalibrated predictions of awkwardness. In truth, however, catching up with an old friend can be a wonderful experience for everyone. We believe that all people need is just a lil' push. CatchUp! exists as a productive catalyst for helping users re-cross familiar paths of their unforgotten past. Facebook has made it possible to be connected with hundreds of old friends at a time. But we want to stop these connections from turning into virtual “friendships” that passively exist on your News Feed by empowering users to take the first step. "", 'At its core, CatchUp! is a productivity app because it utilizes your existing social network for efficient relationship management and streamlines the check-in process using handy conversation starters, dramatically cutting the time you take agonizing about what to say without sounding awkward.  Before building, we incorporated user research and dove into secondary resources, addressing three major pain points when it comes to rekindling old friendships:1) People aren\'t sure if the feelings are mutual — With time and distance in between, it can be difficult to know whether an old friend is willing to catch up with you. That\'s why, on CatchUp!, people can message each other only if they have mutually marked the other as an old friend through the ""Add Contacts"" feature, saving face and cognitive effort.2) People aren\'t sure of what to say — Too many people waste time thinking about the best approach for catching up. Using our ready-made, friendly conversation starters, users can quickly build the stage for more personal or meaningful conversations later on. Start small, end big.  3) People aren\'t sure where their old friends are anymore — When friends drift apart, it\'s hard to keep track of where they are around the world. CatchUp! saves people\'s time by notifying users when they\'re near an old friend using Friend Alert notifications. Organizing meetups or casual coffee chats with old pals has never been easier. ', 'We used Sketch to build a prototype of app UI and to create our logo. We used React Native to build the mobile application and Github to share our code. ', 'Getting all the infrastructure set up to develop this app took longer than we all previously thought. We learned the importance of planning ahead to make sure we hit the grown running (or coding!) when we meet as a team. Likewise, we also found it challenging to divide the workload into small, discrete tasks; this is an area where early planning would be a huge help. Also, although having designers and developers together was good, we had a tough time figuring out the best way to collaborate technology-wise.  ', ""CatchUp! is not your typical productivity app, but it's definitely one of the most important ones. We embarked on a unique mission—to build a tool that harmoniously blends the personal and the practical together such that more people can take control of their social lives.  "", 'We now have a better grasp of how to conceptualize a minimum viable product and to prioritize the necessary tasks and functions related to said product.

The same studies acknowledge the seriousness of the burning of these wastes, which lead to serious health and environmental damage. The recycling of agricultural waste, according to statistics, is easier scientifically and technologically, yet millions of tons of agricultural waste continue to accumulate in front of us every year, leaving mountains of wasted wealth that we cannot deal with only burning and managing our back with all positive solutions.The treatment of agricultural waste is limited to the traditional uses of farmers or is completely eliminated by burning and the result. A black cloud of smoke is not only caused by burning rice straw but caused by other types of waste, which causes an increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide, and therefore a rise in temperature and the consequent change in climate threatens the entire planet with the worst disasters.The phenomenon of open burning is one of the environmental problems that face the Egyptian society in all its sects. It leads to pollution of the environment by severe air pollution attacks that affect the population in the cities and villages with various respiratory diseases and acute episodes of coughing and irritation which start annually during the seasons of maize harvest in Assiut Governorate ( at Upper Egypt ) from August to the end of November. Wind activity during the fall period also leads to the spread of a black cloud that is characterized by heavy black smoke.

"Make A Change With Change","A financial app to empower everyday people to make a big difference with small change","[4736, 'A Youtuber named MrBeast recently brought together more than 600 YouTubers to raise $20 million to plant 20 million trees. Although the campaign was just launched on October 25th, over 12 million dollars have already been raised. In an effort to meet consumer concerns about climate change, we dreamt up Make A Change With Change. Climate change is a burgeoning issue that is too big for any one person to tackle. We believe that any small amount of change can make a big difference, especially when that small change is being made by thousands of people.  ', 'Our idea is an application that financial institutions can implement to build a better world. It offers consumers a convenient way to contribute to the fight against climate change. While there are many things that someone can do to lessen their impact on the earth, most people don\'t know where to start. Our application essentially provides a way for consumers to donate their change from purchases to vetted environmental charities and organizations. This would be an optional feature for users to enable. Here\'s a detailed overview:A user would add our application as a feature to their financial application and build their profile. This application takes the ""change"" from purchases made by any accounts the user chooses to link. The change is calculated as follows: change amounts below 50 cents will be rounded to 50 cents and amounts about 50 will be rounded to the full dollar amount. If the user makes a purchase totaling $23.37, they will be asked if they\'d like to  round this purchase up to $23.50. The change that would be donated to their  chosen charities for this purchase would be 13 cents.  To build their profile, the user would first go over the list of available environmental charities and choose which ones they are interested in. Next, they will be asked if they\'d like to have this as an automatic feature for all purchases or if they\'d like to manually approve purchases to round up. Any transactions that the round-up is approved for will be tracked on the app. The monthly accumulation will be displayed with the transactions listed underneath. At the end of each month, users will be able to choose what percentage of their donation will go to which charity.

So, I created the initial skill as a companion for my website. This will expand my user base to customers with smart home devices.  They can get the latest reviews, without opening their laptop.  Also, this can drive traffic to the initial site.   ', 'I created the skill to give users the last 5 reviews I posted in the major website categories - In The Theater, Made for TV, Must Buy, and Video on Demand. However, I realized a lot of new TV movies come out every week.  And during the holidays, more than 5 would come out at a time.  So, some reviews would never be on the skill.  First, I decided to add a searchable Library.  Even if movie reviews were never displayed on the Made for TV section, it can be added to the library, giving the users exclusive reviews.  For the blog (and myself), I go In the Theater often.  So, I receive Early Screening passes frequently.  These passes allow me to see movie 1 day to 6 months before it comes out in theaters.  These reviews will be in the Early Screening section to my skill.  Now, users can get reviews for movies not in the theater.  Early Screening and the Library will only be accessible to users with a Premium Access subscription.  ', 'The code is based in NodeJS and stored in GitHub.  The code is zipped and sent to the designated Lambda function.  Most of the information is housed in JS files.  However, the Library is stored in AuroraDB.  And all images are in a public S3 bucket.  Once the skill is approved, CodePipeline will be used.  CodePipeline will listen for a git push signal.  Once signaled, CodeBuild will build the skill and push it to a test Lambda and put a copy of the file in a private S3 bucket.  CodePipeline has a manual testing step, so I can view and hear what Alexa is saying and showing to the customer.  Once approved, another CodeBuild will get the zipped file from S3 and push it to the production Lambda. ', ""When I decided to add the library, I had to determine the best database.  Since the code would require a lot of searches and bring back 0 to many results, a relational database is the best option.  So, I choose RDS.  I put my Lambda and RDS in the same VPC and the search worked fine.  However, the ISP did not.  I didn't realize that my Lambda could not be in a VPC while using the ISP.  So, I put a message in slack and it was suggested I use AuroraDB.  Moving the database wasn't a lateral move since my RDS was using MySQL 5.7 and AuroraDB uses MySQL 5.6.  So, I used a SELECT statement to print everything to a file.  Then created a script to read that file and created insert statements.  I fed those insert statements to AuroraDB.  With a working database, I was able to remove my Lambda from the VPC and the ISP worked fine.  Next, were region issues.  Since I created my skill over a year ago, at some point Amazon Pushed my code to all English speaking countries.  Unfortunately, EN-CA and EN-IN don't use ISP.  So I had to update my code to say and display different things based on location.  It required creating a speech and display object.  The functions check the user's location before writing or speaking. "", 'For six months, I wanted to create a library and have an ISP.  But I always made excuses.  ""I have to work"", ""I have movies to review"", ""I need to update my site"", etc.  This hackathon removed the excuses and put a due date on my work.  I was gently pushed into getting it done.  I am truly proud it is complete. ', ""I learned a lot about AuroraDB.  I never considered using it because of the price.  However, it's worth the price because it reduces a lot of the VPC headaches.  I learned more about customer experience with this project.  My past Skill had very basic functionality.  Now, I was able to add full sentences to provide a better user experience.   "", 'On social media, I get requests to review certain movies.  Whether it comes from the director, actor, writer, or a fan of the network.

"Mafia Unicorns","Mafia Unicorns is a deduction game, modeling a conflict between two groups, each of them battling to win. The purpose is to increase user engagement in Mirro and apply monetization with gamification.","[4577, 'As we all know Mirro is an important project for our company and we wanted to help out with the challenges the app is facing, one being user engagement. So in order to help out on this matter, we thought a popular game will be the best solution, and “Mafia” came to our minds. We’ve adjusted the rules, made them simpler, and adapted the characters to match the Mirro’s theme. Mafia’s predecessors are The Werewolves of Millers Hollow and Cluedo – games that have been famous in Europe since the 1950s. The modern, team-based reincarnation of the game was thought up in 1986 by psychology student Dmitry Davydov.The most popular version of Mafia is as follows: the leader of the game deals out the cards to the 8-16 other players. Two or three of them are given the role of mafia members, one is told to be a policeman, and the rest are civilians. The leader announces that night has fallen and the city is falling asleep.The mafia wakes up, they make each other’s acquaintance and then “murder” one of the civilians. At night, the policeman and the leader decide which player is in with the mafia. “Morning” comes, the players wake up and discuss who could be the murderer, and, after a vote, the player with the most unconvincing story is put in jail.Days and nights continue until the mafia members are in the majority, or until all the bad guys are in jail. Each game lasts for about half an hour. ', 'Enter the game and register for the game session, then wait for you to be assigned either to the Unicorns’ side or the Hell Gallopers’ side. Start chatting with the other game players and decide who should lose his magic dust. Vote and steal the magic dust. Do this in multiple cycles until either your team or the rival one wins by stealing all the magic dust. Our RPA has already built the game for you. ', 'We started from a set of rules and characters, defined within the team, then we’ve created the design for the characters using Adobe Illustrator, and animated them with Adobe Animate. The process continued with the game implementation using Node.JS as the programming language, Express as the framework and MongoDB for the database. We’ve also added a small RPA robot that can trigger the game session for the users when needed/wanted.  ', 'On the design part, the animation was an interesting challenge as we’ve worked with a new tool and no experience.

"Gridsy ","Gridsy is a public, enterprise-grade blockchain platform specifically designed for the energy sector’s regulatory, operational, and market needs.","[5287, ""Egypt possesses an abundance of land, sunny weather and high wind speeds, making it a prime location for renewable energy sources. The renewable energy equipment market is potentially worth billions of dollars.  The Government of Egypt is cognizant of the need for a sustainable energy mix to both address increasing demand, and to move to a more environmentally sustainable and diverse electricity sector. The 2035 Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy, which builds on previous strategies, emphasizes the importance of renewable energy.  Egypt intends to increase the supply of electricity generated from renewable sources to 20% by 2022 and 42% by 2035, with solar providing 25 percent by 2035. The private sectors is expected to deliver most of this capacity. In this project, we will show how to encourage private sector to invest in Egypt's solar stations.ProblemThe amount of radiation falling over the entire area of Egypt is more than 6 trillion kilowatt hours per day. That is, more than 100 times the electricity generated during the whole of 1996/97 . yet , we don’t make the best use of it . As Solar Energy Investments are facing some problems , its too expensive that there is no opportunity for Small and micro businesses and  its not common for our peopleIdea BriefOur solution is to encourage investors from all over the world to invest in renewable energy in Egypt. This investment is not limited to large corporations, but also to the encouragement of small and medium enterprises, even individuals. By creating an open energy market.Energy producers make their offers through Gridsy and then the consumer chooses the one that suits them. The transfer of energy is done via government energy grid. The product injects its production into the grid and the consumer takes his needs from the same grid.This solution will significantly increase renewable energy plants. In addition to reducing the burden of energy subsidies on the government and the transformation of energy to an open market subject to supply and demand, which leads to competitive environment among investors.

The solution is not scalable, especially not internationally, where other countries may not have the infrastructure and manpower.Main ideaWe implemented a WebApp, which allows a community-driven and internationally scalable method of collecting data for blooming trees. Our goal is to collect as many images of blooming trees as possible to provide a more detailed analysis of the effects of climate change on phenology.How it worksA user is challenged to take a picture of a blooming tree in their community. We predict blooming species of trees on a local level based on historical data. When the user uploads an image of a blooming tree, our Machine Learning model analyzes the picture to classify if the tree is the correct species and if it is in fact blooming. Once verified, the user is eligible for prizes (e.g. coupons, stickers in the App, etc.).Added valueWe propose to motivate and engage individuals to make a real difference in tackling climate change. Our solution is digital and user-friendly with its simple and attractive interface. With the aid of predictive analysis, we make scientific predictions on the bloom times of different species of trees and gamify the collection of blooming tree data through fun challenges. Our method of collecting data provides us with high-density data. Our method is not limited to a single community or country and is internationally scalable.Target groupOur primary target group is school classes, but our solution is fit for many groups, such as gardeners or dog owners. With the aid of state regulation (e.g. Baden-Württemberg), our solution could easily be included in educational programs.

While learning about it, I happened to notice it provided phone number lookups that could provide a caller's name as well.  I had also used YouMail personally in the past, so I happened to check, and they had an API that was able to return a spam risk level.  I tested the two services with a list of phone numbers and neither provided good information for all my test phone numbers, so I researched other sources.  Nothing I could find turned out to be a one-stop-shop, so I decided to use my best sources first and then fall back to the less reliable ones until I get a good result. "", ""I learned about jsonpickle to help serialize my LookupResponseBuilder object so that I could maintain state between the different intents.  I also took some time realize that I had to manually track the last yes / no question I asked so that I could respond appropriately in the Yes and No Intents.  One of the biggest issues I ran into was figuring out how to use DynamoDB along with an Alexa Hosted Skill.  Getting the built-in persistent_attributes to work with DynamoDB rather than S3 in this case took a while to figure out because there were no samples or explicit instructions, that I could find demonstrating this scenario. I also had a lot of trouble getting the security set up because the instructions were not clear on the fact that after I got AWS Role set up, I needed to take the ARN from the role and use it in the code... (I was originally trying to use the ARN of my skill in the code because the instructions said to use it when setting up the role but didn't explain that after the role was set up, I needed to take the new ARN of the role and put it back into my code.)  I'm glad I started my project early, so I had plenty of time to work through these unforeseen stumbling blocks. "", 'Overall, I feel like the skill has turned out to be the best that it can be for a v1 launch.  I did a proof of concept that proved the idea would work, but then I started down a path that resulted in a complicated user experience because I was going to provide two subscription levels (basic and premium) along with multiple sized packs of consumable lookups. Trying to juggle all those possibilities made for a clunky and confusing user experience.  The premium lookups would have been able to return lots of information including the caller\'s name, address, demographics, household members, etc. which isn\'t conducive to a voice UI. So, after some initial testing, I ultimately took a different approach and decided to start over.  The latest iteration of the skill provides free spam checking lookups and one free caller name lookup per month to everyone.  This is to get customers engaged with the skill so that they can be periodically upsold to one of the premium products.  To make it simple, the subscription provides unlimited access to caller name lookups for $2.99 and there is also a 3-lookup pack for 99 cents. The 3 pack is mainly intended for those people who just want to try the service with no ongoing commitment.  However, it also serves as a point of reference to give customers something to compare the cost of the monthly subscription to and make it appear to be a better value. I also followed the recommendation to only upsell in such a way that it doesn\'t bother the customer too much.  The skill will only offer an upsell after both 72 hours have passed and the customer has checked at least 5 numbers since the last upsell. This way, heavy users will only be prompted to purchase every 3 days and light users with be prompted after every 5th lookup.On top of that, I\'m proud that I\'ve been able to refine the customer experience by streamlining the launch intent to welcome the customer and then only speak a tag line if they are not a subscriber, they don\'t have any paid lookups remaining, and their lifetime lookup usage count is divisible by 5. This allows the skill to get the customer the information they are seeking more quickly since the detailed welcome message isn\'t repeated every time the skill is launched.  I also revised the skill\'s responses as much as possible to remove any extraneous words or phrases in order to provide the requested information to the customer as quickly as possible. In addition, I tried to use randomization to pick equivalent words and phrases wherever possible so that the speech seems more natural and less repetitive. Finally, I created a jingle that plays when the skill launches and added a few ""earcons"" that play before the spam result is spoken which help indicate the spam risk level of the phone number.  The jingle sounds like the syllables in the words ""phone hero"" to help the customer know they are at the right place.   ', ""I had some exposure to Python through some classes in the past, but this project was my first time using it to build a production product, so I had quite a bit to learn about the language itself. I also learned about python Virtual environments, VS Code, the Alexa Skills Kit, pytest, jsonpickle (it's amazing), and DynamoDB for the first time. "", 'I thought about adding a feature that can provide random tips to protect yourself against spam callers, fraudsters, and the like. I also plan to add an intent that will allow users to enter a promotion code or secret phrase to get several free lookups as a general promotion or as an incentive for people to provide me with feedback to help improve the skill. I even have plans to do some marketing campaigns once I am sure the pricing of the products is appropriate.

"OTR Ledger","Decentralized fleet payment and lending for over-the-road expenses","[7351, 'OTR Ledger is a decentralized finance platform for over-the-road fees related to freight hauling.During the freight transport process, drivers must account for additional over-the-road expenses and fees out-of-pocket that are often unfair and illegal. While on the road, transporting shipments outside of regular business hours, truck drivers do not have ready access to their banks.Currently, no platform exists that lends to over-the-road truck drivers who need capital outside of regular business hours, reliable service to continue the freight transport process, tracks transactions and identifies unusual fees between warehouses/shippers/receivers and truck drivers publicly, and aggregates average costs to service trucks.A decentralized finance platform and ledger listing transactions allows for:1) Greater transparency among warehouses, service providers, and carriers2) Accountability among warehouses and shippers/receivers for unfair and illegal fees, data that enables dialogue between vendors and warehouses3) Greater information on fee requirements for specific shipping routes4) An ""anonymous"" voice for truck drivers from marginalized communities - immigrants and female drivers5) Eliminate wait time for reimbursement6) Track over-the-road expenses for taxes7) Better budget forecasting for truck drivers and vendors (who reimburse truck drivers for costs)Ready access to capital anywhere on the road Third-party logistics brokers and transportation customers do not outline or are even aware of these fees, leaving truck drivers to secure additional money to pay upfront for these hidden fees and causing delays if drivers cannot secure the money through traditional credit services such as T-Check and wire transfer right away. For example, third-party logistics providers are not required to outline permit requirements for specific products to truck drivers. Only upon arrival at a receiving warehouse that truck drivers then may find that the warehouse cannot unload their truck until they pay for and secure a beer hauling permit from a local comptroller\'s office. A decentralized lending platform allows truck drivers to secure capital while on the road in areas that they do not have access to their banks and verify payment of fees on the blockchain to confirm reimbursement.Public transparency and anticipation of fees Warehouses are not required and often do not publish fees and rules on freight shipments, making accountability for and standardization of fees difficult. Variation in fees at different warehouses cause confusion, inability to predict upfront costs needed, and lack of guidelines for fair prices. For example, certain warehouses require truck drivers to pay for unloading/loading or ""lumper"" fees for their staff or an external service to load/unload. UNFI, one of the largest grocer warehouse providers, charge more than $63 for a full truckload while according to TruckerReport.com, the largest trucker online forum, drivers have been charged up to $500 for lumper services at other warehouses. Warehouses may require truck drivers to only use a specific external service that may overcharge drivers due to the lack of competition and public forum to post their fees. A transaction ledger of payments can help truck drivers better anticipate general fees at a specific shipping route or warehouse and make warehouses accountable for unfair and illegal fees.End to industry discrimination and unfair labor practices related to fees and paymentsIn addition to truck drivers paying for service fees, warehouses, shippers/receivers, and/or entities that pay for the transportation costs must compensate truck drivers for additional wait time for unloading/loading or ""detention."" According to the American Transportation Research Institute, female truck drivers are 83.3 percent more likely than male truck drivers to experience more than six hour delays, 34.3 percent more likely to experience four to six hour delays, 14.6 percent more likely to experience two to four hour delays.How I built itI went through Solidity tutorials. I created my own smart contract for lending to truck drivers and used the Fulcrum integration using bzx.Challenges I ran intoI chose to work with bzx since it was a decentralized margin lending protocol on the Ethereum mainnet. I did not exactly have a fully functioning dapp. As a beginner with Solidity, I did not initially understand how to start integrate using Kyber and bzx. In order to help bzx generate mass adoption, I have listed suggestions to the documentation that would help better guide beginners and intermediates in Solidity.Challenge: Advanced documentation that lacked an introduction tutorialThe Fulcrum bzx tutorial included technical terms that beginners would not learn in an intro to Solidity tutorial.

"Well Timed","Split your orders into several smaller ones which will be executed for you at predefined intervals in the future! Perfect for accumulating or devesting low liquidity ERC20 tokens","[2982, 'With the rise of ERC20 tokens and Ethereum, entrepreneurs from all over the world were able to create unique tokenized assets that given an adequate cryptoeconomic model, enables all participants of the ethereum network to become a stakeholder in that system, be it as a producer (staker), investors (hodler) or user. Decentralized Exchanges such as Kyber Network or Uniswap play a key part in this new financial world as they are the protocols that facilitate exchange and liquidity.However, unfortunately as of today, most ERC20 tokens suffer from low liquidity and hence expose their investors to extreme volatility and risk. Even if an investor is very confident in the quality of a token, she can most likely only invest a small amount per time, as the low volumes would result in significant slippage and hence bad prices. That is where Well Timed comes into place. Rather than investing or devesting from a token all in once, users of the dapp can simply select a timeframe that they feel comfortable purchasing or selling off an asset and the dapp handles the deferred executions of swaps on Kyber network for them. Well Timed can be used for token buybacks, slow accumulation of tokens or slow devesting without causing major price dumps. ', 'Well Timed takes one transaction for e.g. 10.000 DAI to KNC and splits it into e.g. 5 x 2.000 DAI market orders over a period of e.g. 5 days, where each trade occurs 24h after the last one.

In return the investor gets 7 iSnx and 3 iMatic coins - similar to compound cTokes - So that these investments can be traded in secondary markets.The SNX are staked in the Synthetix protocol and Matic tokens are delegated to a validator.Later, when SNX fees is disbursed to stakers, say 14 SNX, so the pool holds 21 SNX in total and each iSnx token is now worth 21/7 = 3 SNX.Similarly, when PoS rewards are distributed to Matic delegators, the pool gets bigger and iMatic appreciates in value.

"Polar","One-click Bitcoin Lightning networks for local app development &amp; testing","[6323, 'As a contributor to a couple Lightning apps, I went through the tedious process of setting up a local regtest lightning network. This involved downloading bticoind & LND, reading a fair amount of documentation on what command line flags and configuration settings to use to run both in regtest mode. After many hours of trial and error, googling, I finally got the network up and running. Since there\'s no way I\'m going to remember the correct command line flags, I save some bash aliases, for example:# bitcoind/lnd regtest environmentexport LNDREGDIR=$HOME/dev/lnd-regtestexport LNDREGMACDIR=chain/bitcoin/regtest/admin.macaroonalias brd=""bitcoind --datadir=$LNDREGDIR/bitcoin""alias brc=""bitcoin-cli --datadir=$LNDREGDIR/bitcoin""alias brq=""bitcoin-qt --datadir=$LNDREGDIR/bitcoin""alias lndra=""lnd --rpclisten=localhost:10001 --listen=localhost:10011 --restlisten=localhost:8001 --externalip=localhost:10011 --alias=alice --bitcoin.regtest --datadir=$LNDREGDIR/ln-alice""alias lndrb=""lnd --rpclisten=localhost:10002 --listen=localhost:10012 --restlisten=localhost:8002 --externalip=localhost:10012 --alias=bob --bitcoin.regtest --datadir=$LNDREGDIR/ln-bob""alias lndrc=""lnd --rpclisten=localhost:10003 --listen=localhost:10013 --restlisten=localhost:8003 --externalip=localhost:10013 --alias=carol --bitcoin.regtest --datadir=$LNDREGDIR/ln-carol""alias lnra=""lncli --rpcserver=localhost:10001 --macaroonpath=$LNDREGDIR/ln-alice/$LNDREGMACDIR""alias lnrb=""lncli --rpcserver=localhost:10002 --macaroonpath=$LNDREGDIR/ln-bob/$LNDREGMACDIR""alias lnrc=""lncli --rpcserver=localhost:10003 --macaroonpath=$LNDREGDIR/ln-carol/$LNDREGMACDIR""alias lnrstop=""lnra stop && lnrb stop && lnrc stop && brc stop""Cool, now I have a local Lightning network and some commands I can run to boot it up. But now I want to add a couple more nodes, or test the app against multiple versions of LND, or add c-lightning & eclair nodes into the mix. It just got real! This would require a bunch more aliases, folders to store data, and a lot of trial and error.The local development environment setup process for Lightning leaves a lot of room for improvement. I want to get started building my app as quickly as possible. The current situation would likely take your average app developer many hours, if not days, to get their own code talking to a running lightning/bitcoin node locally.I decided to build Polar to allow myself & other developers to get up and running in minutes and not have to touch a command line or config file. ', 'Polar leverages docker containers for LND & bitcoind to quickly boot up network nodes on Windows, Mac & Linux. Using a graphical interface, developers can:Create one or more regtest Lightning Networks in just a few clicksConnect from your app to the lightning nodes via RPCAdd more nodes using drag & dropOpen & Close ChannelsManually mine new blocksOpen a terminal connected to each node to run commandsDeposit regtest coins into each Lightning node ', ""I started with a basic electron app structure, then added create-react-app with typescript. I then began configuring the docker containers to boot up bitcoind and LND in a regtest environment. Once that was working, I leveraged a react-flow chart library to display a visualization of the network and to allow the user to interact with nodes & channels in the UI. I used the @radar/lnrpc library to talk to the LND nodes over GRPC and the bitcoin-core library to talk to bitcoind nodes.  and Throughout this process, I continually added unit tests and e2e tests. I am a big fan of automated testing of an application. Having worked on large projects in the past with no tests, I know what's it's like to lack confidence in making changes, fearful that any small change will break functionality somewhere else in your code. So I wanted to make sure I included tests from the beginning. Along the same lines, I also know how challenging it can be to retrofit multi-language support into an existing application, so I included i18n support from the start. Once most of the application architecture was in place, adding new features like adding nodes and opening channels were pretty trivial. "", 'My biggest challenge is cross-platform testing of the app. I dual-boot OSX & Windows but being able to run my app and test on the different flavors of linux continues to be a burden. I plan to spend more time trying to figure out a way to streamline this process.

I have previously used docker in a limited capacity. While I wouldn't consider myself an expert, I know much more now about containers, images, networks, etc. than I did before. "", 'My highest priority right now is to get a first release out to the public and hopefully get some lightning network developers using it and providing feedback. In future releases, I plan to add support for more lightning node implementations such as c-lightning and eclair. I want to also add a BTC block explorer as well as REST/GRPC API explorers to give the user access to the full RPC interfaces of the nodes. I think a great addition would be to include some tutorial-like content and code for sample apps directly in Polar to help devs get started connecting to their local nodes. I can imagine a developer creating a local Lightning Network and then asking themselves ""now what?"". There is still much to wrap your head around regarding connecting to the nodes via RPC.

There is a growing population of people in college and universities that skip meals due to financial issues or simply not having the time.

From there, the system can recommend and facilitate healthy recipes and eating.What it DoesbrAInfreeze is a smart fridge mobile application that allows users to track and plan their grocery shopping and diet options.

On the groceries tab, ingredients can be added to a shopping list for future purchase.How we built itThe front end of brAInfreeze was built on React.Native, and the back end was implemented in Python. The two systems are bridged by a Firebase Database, which stores all application data. To collect data, a camera was connected to a Raspberry Pi, which runs a Python script for machine learning and database access. Because computer vision is CPU intensive process, the Raspberry Pi was attached to the top of the fridge for additional cooling.The object recognition script was adapted from a pre-trained convolutional neural network that relies on the OpenCV, NumPy, and TensorFlow packages. Challenges we ran intoImplementing the database input and output pipelines was the most challenging part of our project.

"Virtus","A platform for hosting virtual office hours.","[5045, ""The demand for education is increasing with each passing year, forcing colleges to admit more and more students. This has led to larger class sizes where, unfortunately, professors have no choice but to mass-lecture to hundreds of students. In the face of this generic learning experience, our vision is to make personalized education feasible.In our experience, office hours provide an invaluable, personalized opportunity at getting help. Students are able to directly speak with instructors/assistants, get instant feedback, and truly digest the material.However, office hours are limited. Restricted to small rooms or a few tables and only available for a few hours scattered throughout the week, it's far too easy for students to not get the help they need. And, with the rise in admissions, it's becoming obvious that office hours don't scale. Our solution: Virtus. "", ""Virtus is a platform for hosting online office hours. Instructors can register their class, set up a broadcast, and host office hours remotely. Students can then join the stream, submit questions to the instructor, and collaborate with other students in a chatroom, gaining a personalized education without the limitations of a physical room.Virtus also removes the temporal bounds of traditional office hours: all broadcasts are automatically saved as recordings after they've ended, allowing students who cannot make the session to learn at a time convenient for them. This also saves instructors from having to manage hoards of students, many of whom come to learn from other students' questions.Virtus is a scalable solution for personalized education that makes office hours more productive and efficient for students and instructors. "", ""We used ReactJS for the frontend, Google Cloud Platform's Firebase for the backend database, and NodeJS to connect the frontend and backend. For our livestreaming service, we used Mux, an open-sourced API.  "", ""Our biggest challenge was balancing ideation and feasibility. We had brainstormed an endless list of features for Virtus that would help re-personalize modern education. Given the hackathon's time constraint, however, we were forced to chip away while still maintaining the integrity and focus of the product. Prioritizing essential features meant understanding the value of Virtus, and deciding how best to provide that. The major technical challenge we encountered was livestreaming service latency. Caused by the heavy traffic of the gym-WiFi, high latency made testing and development difficult. Using Virtus at home or in the library, however, produced excellent results. "", ""So, so many. We've developed an impactful solution to the problem we wanted to tackle. Seeing Virtus come to life from an idea to a whiteboard to a polished software was incredible. We're particularly proud of the high-quality livestream, realtime chat and ticketing systems, and automatically saved recordings--all of which help make virtual office hours a scalable solution to educational needs.

As the hackathon progressed, we became better at dividing work and communicating, greatly boosting our efficiency.Technically, everyone on our team ended up learning at least one new technology along the way, whether it be Firebase integration or setting up end-to-end livestreaming. ', ""One of the hallmarks of Virtus is its potential to expand. For example, we want to add timestamps for when instructors answer a question, allowing students to easily view and navigate to when a question they have was answered. Other planned features include a live chat replay during recorded office hours, and generating transcripts for recordings for easy searchability.After completing these features, we'd love to try a beta with some instructors!

Our objective was to maximize simplicity to minimize user effort. "", 'Much of the functionality is yet to be perfected. At the moment, we have what is essentially a web application that receives user input, through audio or text, and sets a reminder with the necessary parameters. It audibly reads back the set reminder for confirmation. ', 'For the back-end, we utilized various AWS products. We used Amazon Transcribe to listen to voice input and create text, Amazon Lex to read the text and respond in the appropriate manner, and Amazon Lamda to save the reminder parameters into an Amazon DynamoDB database.For the front-end, we utilized React JS to create the framework necessary to process/access the user voice input. Additionally, we used HTML5 and CSS3 to develop a visually appealing website. ', 'The first challenge that we ran into was our shared inexperience with AWS. For the whole team, it was the first time using AWS products. A fair amount of time was devoted just to developing a foundational understanding of the above AWS products. Additionally, our implementation of Amazon Transcribe through React JS was causing the user voice input-to-text function to produce inconsistent results.  ', 'Overall, we are incredibly proud of the familiarity with AWS gained throughout this project. In addition to this, we are happy that each member was able specialize and learn in depth about a specific, technical aspect of the project. ', 'We learned how to use a host of AWS products including Amazon Transcribe, Lambda, Lex, DynamoDB, S3, and Translate. Furthermore, we developed a deeper understanding of React JS and its implementation of outside API.  ', 'We are looking to expand the functionality of our project. In the time allotted, we were unable to implement all the functions that we intended to. We are excited to take our newfound knowledge to the next level and further grow Alan AI!

"Stakk","Often, students find it hard to plan and organize study groups due to differing schedules and lack of connections. Stakk makes finding people to study with easy and also helps guide a study session.","[4084, 'With midterm season approaching, we found that it was difficult to plan group study sessions due to a lack of effective communication between classmates. In a large public campus such as UCSD, some lower division classes contain upwards of about 300 students yet it is still hard to find people to study-group with. Additionally, study groups tend to get off topic or splinter into smaller groups as people focus on different material, defeating the whole purpose of study-grouping. So we came up with Stakks! ', ""Stakks is a web app that organizes the study-grouping process. To form or find a study group, students simply need to input the basics of their study-grouping plans (when and what class) and the app will filter out study group plans that fit their schedule. If no study groups suits their needs, students can create a study group plan for everyone else to see. These group listings can be made password protected or private. Students can either create an account or simply use the app as a guest.When creating these plans, students are encouraged to list down main topics that they plan on going over. They list those topics down on a stack of virtual flash cards, called Stakks, that the web app provides. Stakks are essentially a stack of flash cards meant to guide study sessions and are meant to be filled by topics, questions, or anything that the user wants to go over in the study session. A user can make and share their own Stakks, but more importantly, they can bind their stack onto a study group listing. This way, students looking to study group can get a rough idea on what the study-group will go over.During the study group session, Stakks can be used as a guide to focus down the session. Anyone in the study group can suggest edits to the Stakk. However, only the Stakk owner has full control of what gets displayed in a Stakk during a study session. Stakks can be randomized or ordered to fit the group's needs.The Stakks system encourages planning and organization before study-grouping and collaboration and focus during study-grouping. The web app aims to make study groups more accessible and effective. "", 'This web app is based on the FERN stack, or Firebase, Express, React, and Node. We used Node, Express, and Firebase to set up a backend very quickly, giving us access to user authentication and databases. The front end wasbuilt using React components, and used axios to submit HTTP requests to the Node server, which then was about to query the Firebase database and send a response with the data that we need.

In college, it is very easy to slip into unhealthy eating habits. We wanted to create an app that would help us improve our eating habits and encourage us to cook own meals. ', 'The app allows the user to create meal plans based on a list of healthy recipes. The user inputs food preferences and dietary restrictions, and the app gives them a list of recipes specifically for them. The app informs the user of the nutritional value and calorie count of each recipe to allow them to create meal plans according to their health needs. ', 'We used Android Studio to build the front end and back end of the app. We at first wanted to make a list of recipes that our users could prep and better understand the nutritional and health benefits. With all the recipes that we would add to our app, we first had to take into account dietary preferences and restrictions of our users in order to generate a list of recipes that were catered to them and could motivate them in a healthy manner. After getting a little information about our user, we created a library of all the recipes, pulling in nutritional information, shopping, ingredients needed off or websites like Food Network and food blogs etc. We then created a way for the user to prep a daily meal plan, where we would store all the ingredients/recipe instructions the user needed and what kind of nutrition they would be prepping. We could then save their meals so that when they wanted to go shopping or prep meals for the day, everything would be in one place.  ', 'No one in our team had experience with Android Studio, so it was initially challenging for us to use it effectively for our app. Even simple tasks such as creating a button or placing an image into the file were difficult and time consuming at first.Because all of us only had experience mainly in command line and Java, we had little experience implementing the front end and UI. Taking into account how things would be laid out and how the logic would interact with what the user selected and how to manage information/app flow/and for proper design elements, we had to learn everything from scratch.

"Smart Heated Gloves","This is a smart, connected heated glove for those with Raynaud's disease, a condition that restricts bloodflow to extremilities when cold and can cause pain, numbness, and even tissue loss/death.","[4876, ""One of our group members has Raynaud's disease, and has finger and hand pain whenever writing in the cold. He wanted a smart, customizable, and portable solution that went beyond passive heat retention and could reflect the needs of the individual as well as adapt to his changing hand heat. "", ""Using the app we created for your phone, our project allows the 5% of the US population affected by Raynaud’s Syndrome to keep their extremities warm. Using a portable device that can be fitted to gloves and socks, we allow users to set the temperature they wish to attain and maintain in order to lessen the painful impacts caused by Reynaud’s syndrome.This goes beyond normal insulated or heated gloves. Not only does this work better for treatment, being able to heat to a preferred temperature, but the product operates within an entirely different scope as well: prevention. Due to temperature sensing, the glove can turn on or alert the user _ before _ a Raynaud's attack, before the user notices gradual changes in their body heat. "", 'The heating component of our device is a simple circuit which generates heat by allowing current to flow through carbon tape. This circuit features a light to indicate that the warmth is flowing, as well as a fail safe device that cuts electricity if over 45 degrees Celsius. We programmed an ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE and the ESP8266Wifi library to act as an access point for our app to connect. The app, built in MIT App Inventor, allows the ESP to be in 3 modes: Off, On, or Auto. Using a thermal sensor on the glove, we allow the user to wirelessly choose a temperature (in Celsius) that the glove warms to and maintains. ', 'One of the biggest issues we ran into was flashing our ESP8266, as initially it was not detecting on the Arduino IDE and therefore we could not upload any code. We also ran into issues connecting the circuit to the carbon tape, as without proper contact it does not heat properly. Analyzing the circuit for the effective currents through the tape proved difficult, but was resolved with trial and error. Also, we went through numerous iterations for our App choice, initially starting with Android Studio before deciding to move forward with MIT App Inventor. One thing we never solved was the ability to send data from the ESP to the App, in order to show a graph of temperatures across usage. ', 'While most of us on the team had experience using Arduino before this hackathon, we had no experience using Arduino-based IoT Technology. The idea that we created our own server based off of this chip, and used it to communicate between our phone and a physical circuit is an impressive step towards complex multi-node IoT systems. Surprisingly, the ability to utilize MIT App Inventor was something we struggled with and were happy turned out well. App Inventor certainly made the front end much easier to create, but being restricted to logic flow using draggable code blocks proved to be a challenge when attempting to create the backend logic that allows us to set and maintain temperatures. Trial and error along with the ability to compromise according to constrained time and resources ultimately allowed us to produce a functional prototype that can be further refined into a practical device. ', 'One lesson we learned is keeping our workspace clean. This lesson only came after we burnt a power strip, and part of a laptop charger. Also, we learned we should communicate better as there were points team members were doing nothing, while others were busy stressing over their parts. And at T-5 hours from submitting, we learned to isolate our power sources, as we could have avoided probably 4 hours of head-ache by using two instead of one. Overall, however, we learned a lot about combining physical and software components and workloads to create a full product. ', ""There is a lot we could stand to improve with our design. It is very evident that it is a prototype, whether it is the use of a breadboard in our circuit, or the use of sewing to secure the heating tape. Using LiPo batteries, a custom PCB, and integrated components would greatly increase the portability of our project. Also, we could use more data analysis in our app, in order to track remaining battery as well as any data on the user's Raynaud’s syndrome that could be used to help diagnose potential issues.

"Hocus Focus","The web is filled with time consuming distractions. With the help of Hocus Focus you'll be able to work without interruption, focus on goals, and keep track of your progress with just a few clicks. ","[8343, ""The internet is a wonderful tool that provides a way to connect with other people, learn whatever you want to learn, and create many incredible things. However, it comes at a large cost which many are only beginning to realize. With distractions easily accessible at all times and platforms and applications literally designed to be addictive, there's no doubt that these distractions are becoming an increasing problem.  As students we understand how difficult it can be to avoid subconsciously going to Facebook to check up on friends are browse Netflix to find the next best series to Binge. We wanted to conquer the problem of internet distractions and make a Chrome Extension that not only helps counter these distractions from occurring but also promote healthy studying and planning skills. Our extension helps 'magically' cause distractions to disappear, helping the user truly control their internet habits during times of need.  "", ""While there are plenty of website blockers already publicly available, our extension is specifically tailored towards students for when they're studying or trying to accomplish a series of tasks. Our chrome extension contains multiple tools such as: A Website Blacklisting System, which blocks URLs by preventing the tab to even be opened up. The system is synced across Chrome, ensuring that distracting websites are easily blocked at all times deemed necessary. An Interactive To-Do List, which allows users to keep track of the tracks that both need to be done and have been finished. Similarly to the Website Blacklisting System, the system is also synced with Chrome, which means that the To-Do List will remain untouched and waiting for the user even if the browser is closed. The To-Do List even contains a system that rewards the user by playing joyful sounds when a task is completed. A Performance Stopwatch: A stopwatch that initiates the website blocking and keeps track of the amount of time you've spent studying or doing tasks, tracking information used for future analyzation. This extension is all neatly packed up and extremely easy to use making it simple for students to immediately get to work (rather than focusing on initializing all these tools). At a flip of a switch, Hocus Focus cleans the internet of distractions and allows it to only be a useful tool for students to work and learn.  "", ""Because we wanted Hocus Focus to be available to as many students as possible, we decided to create a Chrome Extension, which can be used on practically any computer in an extremely short amount of time. Using a mixture of HTML and Javascript, we were able to build an extension from the ground up and create a pop-up menu for easy access and a settings page which allows for more control over the extension. We also utilized Javascript to keep code running in the background so that our user didn't have to worry about interacting with the extension while they were focused and working. We were then able to use CSS to make the extension beautiful and user friendly. By working with these different languages, we were able to make a useful tool that works with Chrome to create a good working environment without being distracting. The best part? It's extremely simple to install and simply requires a few steps to add it into Chrome Extensions. It will only take a few seconds to load up on hours upon hours of productive studying and work.  "", 'While we had a very big goal in mind, there were a lot of baby steps that our whole team had to take. The biggest part was not knowing ANY of the languages; we all primarily coded in Java or Python. Learning how HTML, CSS, and Javascript interacted with each other had a huge learning curve and we spent a lot of time trying to learn the fundamentals of each language. However, these challenges in itself proved to be very valuable. We were able to learn about how to resolve and debug through experience, and we also solidified our fundamental CS concepts that we applied to these new languages. We were also able to implement many of the challenging features we had in mind, which makes us excited for the features we plan to implement in the future.  ', 'What makes this extension so great was the integration of Google\'s ""cloud"" (for lack of a better description). Our code stores a lot of things within the user profile which ensures that users won\'t have to worry about the list of websites they want blocked or the the list of tasks they need done disappearing. This was an INCREDIBLY difficult process that we didn\'t realize would be so hard to integrate, but after hours of debugging and coding we were able to successfully code it, which will save users loads of time in the long run. Along with that, we\'re extremely proud to have created a product that we feel looks presentable and actually useable in real life. We took a lot of problems that we personally had with internet distractions and working as well as other people\'s personal gripes and resolved them with a toolset that\'s represented simply with a chrome extension pop up. It\'s amazing knowing that we\'ve created such amazing tools that can be accessible and usable to anyone who wants to use them.  ', 'Besides the obvious part that we practically learned the basic fundamentals of these three languages, we also learned a lot about real world product production and how these chrome extensions worked. It was amazing to see what goes on in the background of these simple little buttons and it truly helped us understand what work we were taking for granted. We also learned a lot about project planning, especially since we spent a lot of time preparing an idea and setting milestones to ensure that we had a proper project by the end of the hackathon.  ', ""Hocus Focus doesn't just end with the SD Hackathon. While it is currently a package that users need to download and manually install, we're planning to add it to the Chrome Store to make it easily downloadable for all users, which means more and more people will be able to use the internet more productively. Along with that, there are lots of features that we've begun to implement but due to lack of time were unable to complete. We created code that would track the amount of time a user has studied for which we hope to visualize within our settings page in an analytics tabs. We also have goals of implementing more visualizations and analytics, such as when you tend to study, how long your study sessions tend to be, etc. Along with that we're hoping to add additional modes of focus. Currently our extension allows for you to manually start and stop the timer and the tools but we're hoping to incorporate a mode that doesn't allow you to pause the tools unless you've completed all the tasks you've written on your list. There is a variety of tasks that we're aiming to implement, and we're hoping that this extension can be added onto the store to increase ease of use even more. Hocus Focus isn't only a hackathon project, it's an idea that we feel can truly better students lives and help in their education, and we're extremely excited for its future.

The information from all of the visited pages was stored into a text file, from where the chains were generated.To spawn random images for the entries, we found a Chrome extension to download entire galleries of Instagram profiles and proceeded to pull images from profiles posting cursed images or creepypastas.

I'm on a course staff here at UC Berkeley, and we use Slack for most of our communication just like many other student organizations, so I thought of making a Slack bot. I didn't just want to make a plain and silly chat bot, so I searched around for interesting tool and datasets, and I came upon the gs-quant package from Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs' SDK is intuitive and powerful for financial analysis, so I decided to make a Slack bot that can report on financial data based on the demand of the user. Too bad Slack isn't at this hackathon, haha.What I learnedI learned that developing a Slack bot in python isn't always the best idea, but by the time I realized this I didn't have much time to re-implement everything in JavaScript. The Slack Events API adapter for Python is still under development, and the newest version of the slack python package isn't actually backwards compatible with the Events API adapter. As a result, I refactored my code three times throughout the hackathon to achieve my key goal of supporting different bot reactions and using gs-quant. That situation was a time sink that prevented me from implementing many more features. I also learned about how convenient the gs-quant package is to use and the amount of abstraction it provides to simply data wrangling. How I built itI used Python and packages such as gs-quant, slackclient, pandas, matplotlib and many others to build this project. I mainly read through the Slack and Goldman Sachs API documentations to understand how to use them and their functionalities. I then brainstormed the features I wanted and implemented them. I did debugging as I progressed with my implementation.ChallengesThe main challenge I faced was the complication of using the Slack Events API adapter for Python instead of just doing everything in JavaScript. One of the bugs I encountered (I spent almost two hours debugging it) turned out to be a bug within the slack package and not my project. Another challenge I faced was the parsing of the input that the chat bot gets from listening to events.

We wanted to create an application that consumers would be interested in using, possibly a consumer solution that answered a common real-life problem. Thus, we developed dollAR!

Furthermore, regardless of the plethora of information found online about the product, more than a fifth of all online returns resulting from parities in how the product seems online as opposed to the consumer’s in-person experience with the product.

Thus, we resolved to use machine learning and web development to implement a product that improves their lives. ', 'Signum is our web-interface solution that aims to provide a communication platform for people with hearing and speech impairments. The platform takes a gesture input in the form of an image, processes it, and returns the corresponding ASL letter. The current prototype returns ASL letters for uploaded images, but does not yet provide a two-way video interface.Challenges:Our initial plan was to create a platform that could integrate with Skype to act as a plug-in that could translate ASL for those in need of it. However, once we realized that Skype does not offer open APIs, we decided to modify our idea to taking in only a single livestream from a user’s webcam. Another major challenge was not being able to use Google’s AutoML Video Intelligence API. This would have been ideal since the gesture inputs have been streamed from a webcam. However, the only training data we had available were still images, so we decided to utilise the Vision API for processing purposes. Accomplishments:We used Google Cloud’s AutoML Vision API to train a custom ML model with a custom dataset from Kaggle containing around 18,000 images of ASL characters. We then integrated the API with Firebase to create the backend. This was linked to an HTML/CSS and Javascript frontend developed using Google’s App Engine. What we learned:We learned how to utilize TensorFlow to run machine learning models in a Javascript front-end. Furthermore, we learned how to use Firebase for web application development and train a machine learning model using large data sets, which we acquired from Kaggle.What’s next for Signum:Our next goal is to develop this software into one that supports real-time video streaming with minimal lag.

In the future, we envision additional use cases to implement, such as syncing our plug-in across YouTube videos, translating song lyrics on Spotify, and extending the product to Google’s Assistant and Apple’s Siri to recognise ASL gestures and execute a command, search request, or any other function, thereby solving for one purpose, but extending it to a multitude of platforms and making life more comfortable for people with hearing or speech impairments.

"Change","Change is a hybrid mobile payment platform that eliminates coins from cash transactions","[2775, ""The worst part about paying in cash is handling the spare change afterwards. Given that roughly 40% of all financial transactions in the United States are in cash, it is safe to say that many people face this inconvenience in their every day lives. We wanted to build a solution that would make paying in cash even better - by removing the coins all together.  How does Change work?Imagine you are buying a $7.55 burrito and you are carrying $8 in bills. With Change, the cashier will be able to send the 45 cents directly to your bank account so you don't have to worry about the loose coins. Similarly, if you wanted to add a soda to your order and the total came out to $8.30, you would be able to pay with your $8 in cash and automatically send the rest of the money online. Change is a hands free payment platform that augments physical cash transactions. In addition, users have the option to tip their cashiers directly or donate to a charity of their choice.How we built itChange has 3 major components: a Point-of-Sale device for stores, a mobile app for consumers, and a backend server that hosts all the transactional data generated by moving money around.

"A Computational Approach to mitigating tanking in the NBA","Tanking is taking over the NBA; we seeked to analyze certain features of data that would ","[2255, 'The NBA Draft serves as a lifeline for bottoming teams, replete with freshyoung talent that they hope can bring them back to relevance. Unfortunately, while attemptingto ameliorate the prevalence of tanking, the lottery system as well as its recent revision hassomewhat contributed to perpetual tanking: the 2019 lottery is a prime example. Developing, young, but poorly constructed teams such as the Atlanta Hawks, Chicago Bulls, and thePhoenix Suns, have looked to the draft to build their teams, but were only able to land the 8th,7th, and 6th picks, respectively. Meanwhile, teams like the Memphis Grizzlies and the NewOrleans Pelicans landed the 2nd and 1st overall picks in the draft, which is a testament to theinfallibility of the system for the simple fact that these two teams were the ones tanking: thePelicans rested their star player for 4th quarters for over half the season, and as soon as theGrizzlies entered a mid-season slump, sent away their franchise cornerstone, Marc Gasol, andwere simultaneously actively shopping Mike Conley Jr.We seek to determine an effective win-loss record that accounts for tanking throughout theseason. This adjusted win-loss ratio will be utilized to determine drafting order. Hypothesis:We posit that by determining a quantitative measure of tanking and non-tanking games theNBA can better calculate the true win-loss ratios for teams near the end of a season. Furthermore, we predict that games where a given team has lower average lineup age, minutes playedof the best lineup, offensive/defensive rating, and Pythagorean win shares, can generally beclassified as a tanking game.A shortcoming is that teams can be penalized for poor performance in thebeginning of the year. Some of the applications, as previously states is that we could institute anew draft system without lottery or reformed odds that take into account tanking. The leaguecan take action by punishing significant tanking with the loss of draft picks. For future work,we could add more features and do more case studies based on expert testimonials to refinemodel.Built WithjupyterpythontensorflowTry it outdrive.google.com    Created by  Shardul Kothapalli ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']","['python', 'jupyter', 'tensorflow']","False","0","['shardulkothapalli']","","False","0"

"Help Me Study","The study tracker tool that will help you ACE your exam!","[4142, 'Coming into HackGT, our group decided that we wanted to tackle a real-life, everyday problem that many of our fellow peers face today. This problem turned out to be time management. We realized that throughout our experiences in college, life at a university can be very challenging yet rewarding; however, the best way to make the most out of the opportunities given to us is to manage our time smartly and efficiently. For this reason, we decided to develop a time management tool called “Help Me Study” that enables students to maximize their grades on exams as well as participate in campus extracurriculars and events such as career fairs and hackathons.What It DoesOur web application stores user exam data ranging from hours spent studying, previous examination grades, future examination dates, and desired average examination grade, and passes the information through an algorithm that calculates optimizes the time a student needs to spend studying to reach their desired grade. This provides the student with a personalized dashboard where a student can view their study plan to help them to prepare for the next examination.How We Built It“Help Me Study” is built as a web application powered by JavaScript and Google Cloud’s Firebase Platform. We utilized Firebase’s Authentication application to authenticate users simply and securely, and the Cloud Firestore Platform to store and sync app data in real-time. Each user may register and sign-in to the web application using their email.Challenges We Ran IntoOne of the biggest challenges that our group faced while working on our project was having minimal collective knowledge of JavaScript to power the backend, as well as having to learn Google Cloud’s Platform Systems with no prior experience.Accomplishments We’re Proud OfEven though this was our first time participating in a hackathon, our group was able to deliver a useful, working product from start to finish within the given time constraints. We were also able to successfully integrate Google Firebase with our web application to create a personalized dashboard for each user.What We LearnedWe learned how to use JavaScript, Google Firebase (Authenticator and Firestore), and how to integrate the two together. We also learned how to integrate backend logic with static HTML.What’s Next for “Help Me Study”Our team plans on continuing to update our web application to implement many new features, such as email and mobile verification and a student calendar that will allow students to plan and manage their study schedule.Built Withbootstrapcssgoogle-cloud-authenticatorgoogle-cloud-firebasegoogle-cloud-firestorehtmljavascriptTry it outgithub.com      Submitted to    HackGT 6 Into the Rabbit Hole    Created by  I utilized Google Firestore to store and sync app data in real-time and created an algorithm in JavaScript that enables students to maximize their grades on exams.

"Coursebook","Using AI and web scraping to help you schedule your classes.","[5099, 'Course scheduling is always an extremely stressful time, especially for first-years like us. There is a lot that goes into selecting a course. What is the difficulty of the course? When is it offered? How many professors teach the course? How are the professors that teach the course? Do other students recommend the course? Students often have to compile information from several different sources just to find out enough information about a single course, and this can be extremely exhausting considering that students often take 5-6 courses every semester. Since we four have personally experienced this stress, and with Spring 2020 course scheduling coming up, we wanted to take the initiative to create a program that neatly compiles and presents all of this information for every course offered at Georgia Tech. ', ""User is able to search for any course at Georgia Tech. Within mere seconds of submitting, the user is able to view an arrangement of course information that isn't available at any other source, including the best professors, data on average GPAs and score distributions of each professor's class, a comprehensive and accurate measure of difficulty for each course, and an objective evaluation of professors.The overall difficulty rating (score) for a course is out of 100 (100 being the most challenging), and the professor score/rating is out of 100 as well (100 being the best). The sentiment rating is between 0 (most comments are negative) and 1 (most comments are positive. A rating of -1 means there are not enough comments to analyze. "", 'All of our back-end “pure programming” was done in Python.We used TensorFlow to create a neural-network from scratch and perform sentiment analysis. We trained the Neural Network with over 11,000 ratemyprofessor reviews for University of Illinois Professors. According to our test set, our neural network had 83% accuracy in determining the true sentiment of a written review. We used tokenization and word embeddings to convert reviews into data which we could use to build the Neural Network.We used Django to build the project in the form of a web application so we could quickly integrate our backend (which is in Python) and our frontend (which is in HTML/CSS/JS).We used various python libraries in order to pull information stored in HTML of other websites to gather publically available information on courses and professors that has never before been consolidated. We parsed through the information and cleaned it so it could be used to calculate professor and class ratings live and build the neural network. This allows the site to be automatically up to date with the newest information on courses and professors. We used this data to evaluate the overall difficulty of a course.We wanted to make the UI simple and pleasing for the user because similar websites had bad UIs that were confusing and hard to use.

None of us had any experience in working with Tensorflow or machine learning. We learned about how to build our own model from scratch, and train it on our own original data. It took longer than expected to train because we had so much data, but we learned how to save the model once it trained so we would only have to train it once.It was challenging to scrape data from RateMyProfessor.com due to the large number of advertisements that slowed down the website.

From there, that distance then affects how fast a piezo speaker beeps. As well, I included a threshold where if an object is too close to you, it will play a warning sound. This will help notify the user that they are about to hit something, allowing them to stop before they walk into the object.  "", 'I brought all the parts I needed (hat, sunglasses, Arduino, etc) and soldered them all in house. It took me about 6 hours but I still managed to finish it. What I did was I basically used a baseball cap to house all the electronics and I glued an ultrasonic sensor onto the sunglasses. (See picture) ', 'I was originally planning on using a Serial to MP3 reader player but that fell through after being unable to play sound from it. As well, sometimes the ultrasonic sensor would give off wrong measurements so I set up an averaging system to get an accurate result from the ultrasonic sensors. What this system does it that it samples the data from various times, in this case a millisecond after each other, and then averaging that data.  ', 'Overall, I am just proud of finishing the project. Usually, I go to hackathons with teammates but this time my teammates sadly could not make it. I was afraid that by myself, I would have a difficult time coding and building the entire project. It turns out that not only did I finish the project but I also built it with a few hours remaining. ', ""I learned that sometimes, trial and error is the best way to go about things. While tuning W'all See, I tried doing the math out so I could hit a certain BPM at a certain distance. I did the math, but upon testing, the beeper sounded off and discoordinated. Tired and lacking sleep, I started to randomly put in numbers to tune W'all See. After the third set of guesses I hit the perfect tuning.  "", ""In the future, I would want to make W'all See a standalone unit. This would mean that I could get rid of the hat and place all the electronics inside the sunglasses. Besides this, I would also like to add headphone functionality. Currently, if you use W'all See the people surrendering you can still hear the beeping. To solve this, I would add a headphone jack so users can add their own audio device. This would give some privacy to the user.

"Siren","Helping the deaf with Machine Learning","[4342, ' ', 'Siren is currently an app that listens to the surroundings. It looks for sounds that could be potentially dangerous, such as gunshots, breaking glass, or a chainsaw. Our goal is to use this to help those who may have a hard time hearing or who are deaf. It does this by using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network to recognize spectrograms generated from five-second audio clips. If the AI detects anything abnormal, it will display it on the app, ideally giving warning to the subject and allowing them to avoid danger. ', 'We started with a dataset with 2000 five-second clips, and we extrapolated that dataset to over 20,000 clips. We then used a two-layer CNN with two more dense layers to train. We reached high accuracy quickly and we then implemented this AI into our app. ', ""We initially trained our AI in Python, as Tensorflow is one of the largest machine learning libraries. However, we had many issues importing this to Java. The actual problem didn't stem from the model itself, but rather the pre-processing we did on the data. In order to give the data to the AI, we needed to turn it into a 2D image. However, there was good support for this in Python, but almost no information on this in Java. We spent almost the entire night trying to solve this problem. In the end, we had to transfer to a Python backend that would do the processing for us as a workaround. "", ""The initial dataset we started with only contained 2000 datapoints. When we first attempted to train on this, no matter what we did, it would overfit, meaning it would essentially memorize all of the datapoints so it didn't really learn anything. However, we came up with the idea of combining different sounds together to generate more data. We realized that out of the 50 classifications in the dataset, we only really cared about 19. Using this, we combined each of the audio files from these 19 with 29 random files that we didn't need. We then classified them as the classification of the audio file from the 19. This allowed us to go from 2000 data points to 22,400 datapoints, and also add a grouping for sound that wasn't dangerous. "", 'We ran into a lot of errors with Tensorflow and Keras. During the process of fixing all of the bugs, we learned a lot about how to use machine learning. One interesting thing that we learned about models is that creating a model with a size 220500 dense layer connected to a size 8000 dense layer will most definitely crash Tensorflow. We also learned a lot about research. When we ran into problems with the audio libraries in Java, we realized that audio processing in Java was a lot different from audio processing in Python. The spectrograms were always different. However, at this time, we had already trained our model and we had to see if there was an alternative in Java. In the future, we will definitely verify that our plans will work before testing them. Finally, we also learned that at 24-hour hackathons, making decisions at 3 am and following up on them is usually not a good idea, if an idea at all. ', 'In the future, we intend to improve the project a lot. Due to hardware limitations, we were unable to create anything better than an app for the time being. In the future, being able to make this much smaller to the point of being a wearable would greatly improve the impact of Siren. This would allow us to constantly monitor for danger and immediately notify the user through haptic feedback or even more complex methods.Another improvement that we need to make is to take away the backend and localize everything onto the device. Using a backend means that an internet connection is required at all times for the device to work. This is seriously detrimental as this also adds latency which could make a huge difference in a life or death situation.Finally, we want to improve the accuracy of the model. Any improvement to the model we make will save and improve more lives. Adding more data, improving the model structure, and training for longer are all goals we strive to reach.

MindMap then fetches their browser and messenger history on which 2 layers of NLP sentiment analysis are performed, quantified, and stored in a database. Now, the therapist can use their side of the web app to look at high level data visuals as well as the fine-details and NLP results. They can create notes and discuss long-term emotional trends with their patient. By mapping their patient's mind with modern data analytics and NLP, they become a better therapist as a whole.

Our database is SQLite, backend in Flask, and frontend in React.DocuSignOne issue that arises when data like Messages and search history is used for analytics is the problem of privacy. We wanted to maintain the patient's privacy while ensuring that their physician can still provide them the best care possible. That is why we drafted a Therapist - Patient agreement in DocuSign where the patient can easily understand and consent to the forms of data and analytics that their doctor will have access to. This also amplifies patient ease-of-use since they just are sent the proper contract by their physician via DocuSign and they can understand it and sign it, and their data becomes available for the therapist to use for treatment.

All traders are guilty of waiting too long; when prices jump, they think it will continue to rise and sell past optimality. When prices drop, they hold one hoping the stock will rise to mitigate their loss, only to end up losing 10-15% of their portfolio value.The main goal of the product is to provide mid asset individual portfolio managers, like teachers or doctors with a very quick way to reviewing their portfolios while also giving them understandable insight on potential opportunities and threats based on stocks/industries/ETFs/securities that they have previously identified.

Functional MRI also captures sequential information in the brain; however, there is still substantial mystery about how sequential sensory information such as text, video, or audio, can be used to predict those dynamics.In this work, I apply Sequence to Sequence learning to the problem of predicting functional MRI connectivity. I hope this can be useful both in clinical, entertainment, and research applications, as we all continue to uncover the mysteries of the human brain.

The trained model is then served via a react app which should allow users to explore how text data, and perhaps other sequential data if my models finish training, influence changes in connectivity in the brain. All of the data was processed entirely through AWS batch, with about 1000 MRI volumes ultimately processed with the service.

There are some great resources out there to use for studying, such as Quizlet or Duolingo, but we wanted to go beyond just flashcard generation and language learning. If there was a way to create study materials based off of the notes we took in our classes automatically, it would help us save time and learn our material even better. ', 'The main idea is that a student can upload a document of their notes to the website and the website will return study documents that the student can download.  ', 'We chose to use Amazon Textract to parse key terms out of the document and match them up with tagged documents in a MongoDB database. For example, if a user uploaded notes from a sorting algorithm lecture, tags that could be extracted from those notes might include ""quicksort"", ""mergesort"", and ""heapsort"" for example. Those terms could be used to query the database and find a document that shares the same tags as the lecture notes. We chose to build the app using a MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). Node.js was used for the backend and React for the front end. Our document information is stored inside of MongoDB and Express is an important web framework for Node.js. Along with that, we also utilized HTML and CSS stylesheets for the actual appearance of the website. For storage, we created an Amazon S3 bucket where we stored our documents uploaded and library of documents to deliver to the user.  ', 'The biggest hurdle for us was learning how to use React and Node.js. We have all coded before, but none of us have much experience with Javascript and especially not for a backend. We spent our entire first night just brainstorming how we could make our idea become a reality and watched YouTube tutorials on React and the MERN Stack. Although we felt a bit more comfortable after watching the videos, we still were uneasy starting out. One of the biggest issues was figuring out how React and Node.js worked together. We had decided to split up the work between us into front-end and back-end development. As a result, half of the team understood React and the other half understood Node.js. However, we realized quickly that in order for our web app to work, React would have to be used closely with Node.js. It took a long time to get a grasp on how they worked hand-in-hand. We also struggled with understanding how to use Amazon AWS, as we had never used it before either. We had made the assumption that we could easily use the online tools to implement Textract but we could not figure out how to do so. As a result, we chose to implement Textract through Python but still struggled to understand how the API worked. We also could not figure out how to upload files to the S3 server for a long time, as it was hard to get a grasp on how to have a file be directly uploaded to S3 from React. ', 'It was all of our first hackathons and we are all really proud of all that we were able to accomplish in such a short amount of time.

We also learned a lot about AWS, which is an amazing tool to know how to use for various purposes. Specifically, we learned a lot about the S3 platform and how to use Textract.I think our biggest learning experience was how much time it really takes to develop a fully functioning web app. We unfortunately were not able to create our idea as fully as we had intended to when we first set out, but it also taught us the importance of focusing on one issue at a time rather than being broad with our ideas. All of us feel that we know what to expect from our next hackathon and we hope that we can challenge ourselves even more than we were this time around.

Originally, we intended for the app to generate quizzes based off of lecture notes.

To Stay Healthy, Shop Healthy with us.","[6756, 'Do you know how healthy your diet was last month? Do you have time to enter every meal that you eat?  This was the question that triggered this idea. We were not sure how well/healthy we ate the last month. All the existing apps needed us to enter the meals we have had every time of the day, but I do not even remember what I had yesterday. In that case, what can I do?? Can I fill this gap by analyzing the online ordering transactions to observe the consumption behavior?? We here, tried to provide a solution for this and make sure you shop and eventually eat healthy. There are many applications which suggest food items based on users previous diet, but most of the apps expect users to manually enter the data by themselves frequently. To suggest the user, their diet, we wanted to remove the burden from user end, where he should recollect what all he had last week and enter it in the app to get suggestions. The idea here is to record users previous orders (as of now considered groceries but can extend the same to restaurants as well), we analyse the past orders of the users in terms of calories, fat%, carbs % etc., and suggest the user what to order for the next time so that he can maintaina healthy lifestyle throughout a period of time.

It is never too late to adopt healthier habits and making simple changes to your shopping and cooking routines will help you achieve your goal.We the SeaWolves are here to make that happen. There are numerous apps that focus on calorie intake or ingredients of a product and how harmless it is for the customer to consume.  All the apps require user to input their meal every step of the day whenever they have a meal to measure their health index. Though it covers an aspect, it totally misses the aspect of foods that are eaten but are not logged maybe due to laziness or memorability. We propose a solution, that will make customers purchase the healthier food in the first place rather than look at health as a consequence of food intake.Through this app, we look forward to providing a seamless user experience for people to order grocery or food from their local restaurants. The app then using data at its disposal, crunches the numbers for the user and provides a metric on a how well a consumer has eaten over the months/years. The app uses details from the users order history and makes recommendations of food/grocery items. Say for example, if the previous order had a fried chips in the cart, then our app would remove it from the cart and move it to section that lists the chips along with other alternatives like baked chips option so that, in case user still wants to order chips, he can choose among the healthier option. Here we plan to use the Google Recommendations API to help us with the recommendations based on the rules in data store.Our business model will be similar to the aggregator business model, where we would partner with stores to provide the cart items to user.

The user can control how much importance is given to speed and safety by means of a slider allowing them to speed up their journey if in a rush.

Firstly, using the current GPS co-ordinates, we extract relevant crime data from the UK police database. Then, we assign weightings to different crimes depending on their severity.

This is then made translucent using the PIL library and overlayed over a static image from google maps taken from the API, giving an image of the most dangerous areas. Using a map, we get a safety weighting for 100 x 100m region which leads us to the second stage. Using the google maps api we find nodes at every street junction that define the roadways around the user. Each of these nodes is given a safety weighting based on the heatmap.  After creating a Graph Object using the Networkx library in Python, we penalise the distance between successive nodes of the Graph depending on the user's preference for safety. We then apply Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path. This creates different routes depending on how risk averse the user is.

"H2P-Match","Optimized Matching Algorithm for Creating Stable Hospital-Patient Sets Using Azure for Databases","[4277, 'For the first fourth of the hackathon, we spent our time iterating through a variety of project ideas. Eventually, we identified the root of our difficulties in selecting a project that was doable, challenging, and engaging to the whole group: all of all were more interested in the algorithmic side of our ideas and less knowledgeable/passionate about the specific applications or frameworks that our project ideas would be running off of. Small talk within the group eventually led us to the stable matching algorithm, which we identified as a viable project concept after having one group member whiteboard out the problem for some teammates who had never heard of stable matching. After this came a long session of brainstorming on the potential applications of the algorithm. We settled on the issue of how patients experiencing a medical emergency are matched to a hospital to receive treatment at. If ambulance drivers and paramedics were to implement this algorithm, it would help ensure that patients are brought to the hospital best suited for their needs. ', 'Our project takes the input of a set of patients and a set of hospitals. Each patient is a defined distance away from each hospital and each hospital is given a 0-1 rating on how good they are at treating particular injuries. In the case of our project, hospitals were given separate ratings on how well they treat heart issues, liver issues, kidney issues, and brain damage issues. Each hospital is also given a maximum capacity of patients. Our project takes this information and uses it to determine which hospital every patient in our dataset should go to. This is accomplished by using patients and their ranked list of preferred hospitals - which is based entirely on the distance they are from the hospital - as the primary input and hospitals and the ranked list of patients they prefer to treat - which is entirely based on how good they are at treating the patients’ conditions - as our secondary input into our algorithm. ', 'Our first step was to take what we knew about the stable matching algorithm and put the algorithm into code. This step proved to be much more complex and time-intensive than expected. We had to spend a lot of time conceptualizing our problem and working through pseudocode and mapping examples by hand. After we had our algorithm, we shifted our focus to generating data to test our code. ', ""The most significant challenge we encountered was settling on a project idea in the first place. As a team, we had a wide array of individual ideas about what project to work on but hadn't spent time before the hackathon discussing what type of project we should focus on. Our brainstorming session that was supposed to wrap up Friday night ultimately extended late into Saturday morning. This put us in a time crunch for developing our final project.  "", 'We stretched out the Gale-Shapely one-to-one matching algorithm to work for one-to-many matchings. We were also able to achieve stable matching for two sets with different cardinalities. ', 'We learned that it is essential to have an established workflow for a project and that tracing your code regularly, especially when working on a large-scale project, is very important. All team members also learned a great deal about the logic behind the stable-matching algorithm. ', 'Right now, our project is built around optimizing which hospitals patients go to receive the needed medical treatment given the distance the patient is from the hospital and how highly rated the hospital is in addressing the condition. A possible next step would be increasing the complexity of the matching algorithm by taking into account factors such as the severity of the patients’ conditions and the relative location of hospitals to one another. This project could be implemented into central databases for paramedics to use when delivering the patient to the needed care center.
