"Biasd","Allowing users to learn more about twitter -- and themselves.","['Politics, especially partisan politics, have reemerged in the news in recent times. From the democratic primaries to the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, the public is being flooded with new information. One of the largest sources of this information is Twitter, which is also the preferred form of communication for President Donald Trump. So, we wanted to do something to better understand the information stream of twitter, and we immediately thought of replicating the tweets are a way to discern, as an information consumer, what is false and what is true. \n', 'Our creation allows users to understand their inherent bias, as well as the leanings of twitter. It is a novel way for users to understand the queries that they otherwise would just enter into the search bar of Twitter. Ultimately, Bias allows readers to understand Twitter-and themselves. The user is prompted to enter search queries, from which results are pulled and fake data created. The user then enters this game-like scenario in which they have to choose whether or the tweet is real. In the end, the user is shown a comparison of the sentiment of their favored tweets, as well as the liberal and conservative leanings, as compared with their choices. In the end, they also receive an accuracy score of how accurate they were at discerning what is right and what is wrong. \n', 'The application itself is built on Flask and then hosted locally. The user search query is passed to the Twitter API, from which tweets containing the word are selected. From this corpus of relevant tweets, Markov chaining is used to generate semantically similar tweets. The output is displayed using Charts.js and presented to the user. \n', 'For us, the largest challenge was the segmentation of what we were trying to do. We knew that together, the various parts of the creation (from the fake tweets to the sentiment analysis) would be technically impressive but from a social perspective, meaningless. We knew that each part we could reasonably get running, but we wanted to create a cohesive end product that included all of these parts to best represent how inherent bias affects the understanding of how Twitter information is perceived.\n', 'We are most proud of the integrative system and the game-like mechanism for comparison. We think that asking the user to label tweets would have been boring, and taken away from the individual accuracy of some of the fake tweets. So, we wanted to highlight not just the individual tweets but also the aggregation of the data that gives insight into the user, and having this two-page system allows for that. We are also very happy with the believability of these fake tweets, which surprised us after running the Markov chain generator multiple times. This is especially impressive considering the fact that we had to handle hashtags and mentions, which are very common on Twitter.\n', '\n', 'The next step for Bias will be to expand the features that we can glean from the information we get. In keeping to a Twitter base, we can also get information about the other types of political parties, such as libertarians or socialists. We don’t want to characterize information as either liberal or conservative, as this is a dichotomy that we hope to break and also inherently part of our bias as developers. We’d also potentially want to expand beyond the Twitter corpus and move to other text-based systems such as Reddit, for example. And of course, we’d like to put this out on the web, where everyone can enjoy it, not just us!\n']","['python', 'flask', 'indicoio', 'twitter', 'chart.js']","False","0","['igalakhov', 'yashparikh02']","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/883/283/datas/small.png","False","0"

"Dermax","DerMax is a personal AI skincare disease assistant, which can help patients self-diagnose skin disease and connect the best dermatologists in their vicinity. ","[""Skin cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the US, and other parts of the world alike, though most cases are preventable. The number of people diagnosed with skin cancer in the last three decades is higher than all previous decades combined, and that number is still increasing. $8.1 million dollars a year goes to skin cancer treatment, with $3.3 million alone attribute to melanoma. The ratio of dermatologists vs patients with skin diseases some of the third world countries is 1:6700. Thus, it becomes challenging for patients to find dermatologists and bear a huge financial burden for themselves, their families and substantial healthcare costs for the nation's economy. Earlier diagnosis can prevent patients from missing the best time of treatments, hence can reduce the costs of treatment and avoid complications. It can also be a powerful tool in helping doctors to make a faster, more reliable and more efficient diagnosis of the diseases. We see great potential in technologies like artificial intelligence with various applications in the healthcare industry, which in turn inspires us to use it for solving skin disease prediction problems, to make this world a better place for everyone. In this hackathon, we have developed ‘DerMax’, a personal skincare assistant. \n"", 'Our proposed product, ‘DerMax’, is a personal skincare assistant that can be used to check if one has any skin disease and by dermatologists, providing an extra hand/brain to create a faster diagnosis of skin diseases. We have created a basic website, on which a patient suspected to have some skin disease, can upload a picture of the affected skin region, and at the backend, our image classifier classifies into one of the 10 possible skin diseases. The website then generates a result that shows the probability of the patient having one of the 10 diseases. If the model predicts a high probability of particular skin disease, we plan to direct the patients to one of the best dermatologists in his/her vicinity, decided by a PageRank-like algorithm and can be visualized on the google maps, which is integrated into our website. \n', 'We got an open-source dataset for Skin cancer MNIST dataset from Kaggle, which classifies skin lesion images into either cancerous of skin-disease category. We trained a Resnet 50 classifier on 10,000 images (without data augmentation) and 40,000 images (with data augmentation - flip, mirror, grayscale images, etc.) and classified it into 10 different skin disease classes. We used the pre-trained weights of ResNet50 from the ImageNet dataset and did transfer learning by learning the weights of the final layer. The best accuracy that we received on the validation set was 78.2% while training the model for 50 epochs. We plan to improve on this model’s accuracy by taking the following steps:\n', 'We faced many difficulties while working on this. Firstly, it was a little difficult to get an open-source dataset from the internet, and after searching for a long time, we got a dataset on SKIN CANCER MNIST from Kaggle. Secondly, it was to identify the right model architecture, which could potentially learn the subtle features that differentiate one skin-disease from others. While training the network, tuning the hyperparameters, like the number of neurons in the final layer, learning rate, dropout probabilities, etc. took a substantial amount of our time.

"Pocket Counselor","The Pocket Counselor project is an add-on to the default voice assistant software that provides more human responses to help students deal with stress at school. ","['According to research statistics, 80% of students report that they feel stress on a daily basis and 40% of them don’t actively seek help. The response we get when we are seeking emotional support is often “Sorry, I don’t understand.” or “I’m sorry to hear that.” and this hasn’t changed for many years (at least from 2017). Because smartphones and its built-in voice assistant become prevalent these days, we want to create a pocket therapist that offers immediate emotional support whenever and wherever people are.\n', 'The Pocket Counselor project is an add-on to the default voice assistant software that provides more human responses to help students deal with stress at school. Imagine talking to Siri/Google Assistant about how stressful you are during midterms and instead of hearing “Sorry, I don’t understand.”, they reply to you with “Take some time and go over all the topics you don’t understand. You can do it!” We have trained the voice assistant to recognize and offer different responses to problems related to schoolwork, friends, family, suicidal tendencies, and negative emotions such as sadness, frustration, stress, and depression, etc.\n', 'We built this prototype through the developer platform Actions on Google for Google Assistant. With hours of research into common problems students face, we put at least 5 example phrases as Machine Learning training data for the agent for each intent we have covered. The intents include SchoolPorblem, FamilyProblem, JobProbelm, RelationshipProblem, ImposterSyndrome, LifeSaver, Encouragement, Appreciation, etc. We also provided at least 5 example responses the agent can reply to each intent.

If a user demonstrates severe mental stress or depression, the voice assistant will then seamlessly connect a counselor with the user during the conversion. However, this idea is hard to achieve in reality. Since this service is available for users at any time, it might be difficult to connect users with a counselor at midnight, which involves certain operational costs that cannot be avoided.Training data: Currently, we manually typed in possible conversations between a student with potential mental illness symptoms and the voice assistant. Since it is not a comprehensive dataset, there are use cases that we did not include. For this to be said, our current outcome provides a solid framework that combines counseling feature with voice assistant.User Utterance:How to understand user utterance in a broader context of the dialogue is the main challenge while developing the add-on counseling feature of Google Assistant. In Google Assistant’s developer platform, we can add parameters such as dates, times, and places that define which parts of the user utterances to extract. However, Google Assistant does not allow us to create parameters related to user’s emotions such as sadness, anger, and depression, which can largely improve its ability to identify user’s intentions behind his or her move (e.g. asking a question or making a complaint).\n', 'Built human-like voice assistant with better user experienceCreated potential benefits to students and their communitiesLearned research statistics related to mental health and how technology can help\n', 'Prototyping is fun, although we faced many problems.

"EcoCal","Climate change has been exacerbated in the past decade. At Mount Holyoke College, we developed an App to increase people's carbon footprint awareness and  help them to be more eco-friendly. ","['In January, 2018, the Board of Trustees set the goal of becoming a carbon-neutral campus by 2037, Mount Holyoke’s bicentennial. So far, the school has done a really good job: reduced electricity use by 16% and thermal energy by 13%. The school has been doing a great job so far, but as members of the community, we wonder: can we contribute to the process as individuals? Thus, our group came up with the idea to develop an App to help the students and faculties to participate in the mission and contribute their own effort. \n', ""It learns the user's long-term food preferences and recommends similar foods according to health-factors and eco-factors. The app can increase the usage frequency by giving feedbacks to users' food consumption, their daily carbon footprint and build a community. Here is the interaction procedure:In this part, we include a complete interaction process, including two parts. Environmental behavioural theory Theory of reasoned action (TRA) and theory of planned behaviour (TPB) are common theories used to investigate the factors associated with an individual’s environmental behaviours.Persuasive technology refers to an interactive product that is designed to evaluate changes in attitudes, behaviours and their interactionsThe first part is a pre-survey for first time users, we use environmental behavioral questions and carbon footprint awareness questionnaire (See Appendix 1) to generate personalized eco-friendly scores that’s based on the average carbon footprint of the Moho community. A five-point Likert scale ranging from one to five is used to score responses to each item in the constructs. Each item is constructed according to the national mean and standard deviation. There are two types of questions: a),behavioral questions: “On average, how long does it take you to take a shower? 1, less than 3 mins    2, 3-6 mins    3, 6-9 mins   4, 9-12 mins   5, 12 mins and aboveWe will score this question reversely, add 1 to the total score if the user select ‘12 mins and above. ’b) carbon footprint awareness:“Global warming problems have consequences for my life.”1 Strongly Disagree  2 Disagree 3 Neutral 4 Agree 5 Strongly AgreeWe will add 5 to the total score if the user select ‘Strongly Agree’The app will map the score to the distribution of all users’ scores and present a ranking.After the new user finished the first part, they will join the other users to the second part: Daily log and how to reduce your carbon footprint. It begins the long-term (stable) food preference elicitation. This is to collect what the user generally likes to eat. The user can browse a full catalog of recipes from Mount Holyoke College’s daily menu, and mark those that he/she has eaten or would like to eat that day. This is also the part where the user can specify their diet restrictions. In order to find food recommendations which both appeal the user’s appetite, help them to decrease their carbon dioxide emission and have balanced meals, an active learning technique, which is called User Utility Multidimensional Prediction, is used. We modify existing nutrient-based food recommender algorithm to include additional parameters that are used for modelling the dependencies between the environmental component and and the food preference and nutrition component. \n"", 'Our first step is to calculate the average daily carbon footprint per capita. We scraped the numbers of annual water, electricity and fuel usage from the school website, multiply them by the carbon emission factor. There are approximately 2,335 students and 312 staff and faculties at Mount Holyoke last year, so we get the daily average carbon footprint per capita: 36012122.87/365/2647 = 37.27 ton/per day/ per personWe also want to take school’s recycling programs into consideration.

"EcoWarriors-A Social Game Challenge ","EcoWarriors-A Social Game Challenge To Bring Awareness and Action Toward Climate Change","[""We develop this project through our very personal experience. We deeply care about our environment. However, when we talk to our friends about the impact of climate change, they just feel like another lecture from Mr. or Ms. Environmentalist. They don't care about the topic because they feel like climate change is a big global issue and they can't do anything to change that. Moreover, many of my friends think climate change is just a scientific myth and they don't see any real impact of it in their daily lives. Therefore, through this Climathon, we get together as a team to develop a game app that can visually show the real impact of climate change and how the players can actually change the effect of it through daily activities. Project Description:My team develop a game called “EcoWarriors” to raise awareness about climate change.  Our goal is to help people change their daily habits and adopt a more sustainable lifestyle. Every action of the users will be tracked and converted to score, that score will be the metrics for the wellbeing of their virtual pet. These actions include: Reducing carbon footprint, Using more renewable energy, wasting Less water, reducing waste ( i.e. Changing to reusable shopping bags), choosing businesses that support green living (partners), recycling, walking instead of drivingGame Storyline:The global climate change becomes a huge problem on Earth and many animals are on the edge of extinction. To prevent the mass extinction from happening, the players will act as a wild-lives rescuers and each of them are assigned with a mysterious egg of an endangered animal. Each animal they are assigned will be the very last one of a species. The players will incubate each egg at the beginning stage of the game. After the players reach a certain score, the egg will reveal their assigned animal ( i.e. penguin, dolphin, whale, polar bear…) Depending on the player’s choice of challenge, a set of tasks will be shown. The tasks are daily action in a person’s life, and every completed task be tracked and converted to score. That score will be the metrics (such as air quality, water quality, energy consumption…) will contribute to the wellbeing of their virtual pet and the improvement of the environment in that animal’s habitat. With higher score level, the virtual animals will slowly bear more eggs and have a family of their own to bring their species out of extinction.  This game raise people’s awareness and educate us about the different sustainable in a friendly and fun way that even a kid can understand. This game is great for individuals or the whole family together. Methods for Score Tracking:Take photos of their electric bills, track decreaseShow receipts of restaurants/businessesTrack geolocation for milage of a person when they are walking or biking.Timing showers and water usageGreen membership card to use on bus or partnered green stores/restaurant/coffee shop/markets. Members with this cards can get discounted at those partnered store, too.Reward for Players:Creating “Badges” for each challenge (i.e. Reducing Plastic Waste)Every month, the community of this game will get together to celebrate the top scored players and listen to their journey of changing their daily habits toward a sustainable living goals. This will help fuel up the motivation of the players and build a stronger community full of exciting environmentally-mindful individual.Data Gathering & Visualization:Summarizing the statistic of average consumption of water and energy on a local-level. Training algorithm with real data to perfect our scoring system. Gathering data about local businesses and markets about their level of green-awareness. Using this data to improve users’ experience and connecting them with the right community partners and organizations which promote the sustainable and green living. Impact of Solutions:This game raise people’s awareness and educate us about the different sustainable in a friendly and fun way that even a kid can understand. This game is great for individuals or the whole family together. Therefore, even the ones who are not so interested in environmental issues before will start to be mindful about it through this game. Our ultimate goal is to raise people’s awareness on the topic of climate change and to motivate community to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle via this gamification project.Future Plan:We are developing the app and working on launching our beta version through limited invitation. Then, when we are confident with our final product, we will launch the official version on the app store and then working on promoting the app through advertising and words-of-mouth. When we have a good initial users base, we will work on building a bigger community. Every month, the community of this game will get together to celebrate the top scored players and listen to their journey of changing their daily habits toward a sustainable living goals. This will help fuel up the motivation of the players and build a stronger community full of exciting environmentally-mindful individual.On the data science side of this project, we will work on:Summarizing the statistic of average consumption of water and energy on a local-level.

"Puzzle of the Day","A daily crossword puzzle game - designed from the ground up only for Alexa","['I\'ve always been interested in building games for voice, as voice is such a different medium than the visual ones we are bombarded with throughout the rest of our day. Voice games are a perfect time to sit back, use your imagination, and really immerse yourself in something, similar to reading a book. It activates your brain in ways you don\'t get from your phone, your TV, your consoles, or your computer.I\'ve built games for Alexa in the past, but for this competition I wanted to focus on something specific, and that was retention. Generally most voice games don\'y have great retention - you play it once, finish the content within a week or so, and you\'re over it. While that can provide for an engaging experience, it\'s not always the best path forward for something like ISP. To make some income, you really want people coming back time and time again.Despite the rise of technology in our day to day, and the decline of traditional newspapers, there is still a massive community of crossworld puzzlers around the globe. People still keep their subscriptions solely for the daily crossword. Crossword puzzles and their fun clues are an amazing brainteaser, forcing you to think deeply about words and their meanings, learning and having fun at the same time. Voice seemed like the perfect medium to translate this sort of experience. Voice games are especially great for those ""in-between times"". It\'s something you can do when you wake up, when you are doing the dishes, doing the laundry, driving etc. You may be doing something mindless with your hands, but still want to engage with your brain. These were the times of day I wanted to target.With an idea in mind, I set to work!\n', ""Puzzle of the Day is a daily crossword puzzle style game. The puzzles are built from the ground up for Alexa, and are designed as quick 5-10 minute daily experiences.Each puzzle consists of five words, and a theme.It uses clues similar to those you may find in a crossword puzzle, but removes the crossing component from the game. Instead, solving words give you free 'letter reveals' which act in the same way, but you can be strategic about when to use them. If you are stumped on a hard word, you can pass and rack up some letter reveals to help you with that one later.Once the user guesses all five words, they can wager some points on the theme. Points are earned from solving words, having remaining letter reveals, as well as time bonus for finishing under 5, 10 and 15 minutes. You only get one guess for the theme, but guessing correctly with a high wager could let you double your points.Once solving each daily puzzle, you can see how your score compared to others around the world with an in game leaderboard, giving you your percentile and place for time and points for each day. Users who are more interested in the stats can link their accounts and access the online leaderboards that I built for the game. These are available at https://www.stokedskills.com/puzzleoftheday/You can also set up the email service to get a daily email at the end of the day, so you can see how you compared against all the users of the day (because when you play, you can only get stats for people who played thus far)\n"", ""There are a number of components to this skill:The skill code itself:I built this skill using the Jovo framework. It is developed in Node.js using typescript, and data for each user is being persisted to the skill in DynamoDb. The skill supports the APL interface and has full screen APL support across for all devices, throughout the whole game.The Leaderboards:The leaderboard data can be accessed within the skill, from the website, or from the email service. Leaderboard data is updated whenever a user finishes a puzzle, and is stored in and AWS RDS MySql instance.The Website:The website allows users to view their rankings on a 7 day / Last Month / All time basis. You can look up your user and see your scores for each puzzle you completed. This out of skill component was designed and built to help with user retention. It's built as a static site hosted and Amazon S3, written with javascript in VueJS. Data is accessed via a backend node API hosted in AWS Lambda and API Gateway using the serverless framework. The Email Service:To send emails to users, there is a recurring job each day.  Once a day is completed and we have everyone's scores, we can publish that days results. Using an AWS lambda running on a cron schedule daily, we load up all the scores from the database for the previous day for users that have requested emails. For those users, we calculate their individual stats for percentile and place in time and points and deliver it as an email using Twilio's SendGrid. This system was an integral part of the design as I really wanted to focus on user retention to drive adoption of the ISP.The ISP: For the In Skill Purchase component of the skill, I decided to go with subscriptions. Since I was focused on retention and daily usage, I figured that a recurring model would be the best approach for this skill. I've decided to brand the ISP as the puzzle league, and by subscribing users get extra benefits like more games, and the ability to reveal extra letters. The free component to the game is substantial, but by paying a small monthly fee, those dedicated users can get some extra enjoyment and fun.\n"", ""Because I wanted to build a game of high quality, I included alot of features which increased the scope. Besides the skill itself, I needed to build out the website, the database system for the in-skill leaderboards, and email system, and a content management framework. While building the skill itself, and all the other moving parts were quite a challenge and took lots of iteration to get right, I think the content management aspect was the most interesting challenge I had to face so I wanted to focus on that.Building a daily recurring game means more content every day. To make this word right and with accurate word recognition, I needed to include all of the solutions to the puzzles, including the themes, into the voice model. This means re-certifying with every new puzzle that is added. I could have taken a more risky approach and used an 'open' slot with SearchQuery, but I really wanted the accuracy to be top notch so I took the more involved approach.To get all the data into the skill, I needed a great way to manage the content. Instead of managing the puzzle content in code, I decided it would be way easier to use spreadsheets. In the spreadsheet I can fill in the solutions, the clues, and the themes.From there, I needed to get it into the slots of the skill, and access it from within my skill code. To do so, I built a number of deployment scripts. These scripts are used to do a number of things:Import the spreadsheet into code and convert it into JSON, so the skill code can use it to provide the right puzzlesAutomatically fill in dates and data for all the new puzzles that are addedRun some verification on the generated JSON file to make sure there are no duplicate dates, puzzleIds, etcTake all the words I need from the JSON file in the voice model, (clue answers and theme names) and open up the voice model json file, update the slot values, and save it back to disk so that I could use that to upload to the Alexa service.Upload all the puzzle data into MySql so the website has access to the correct puzzle dataThese scripts allow me to do all the data management I need in only a minute or so, saving me alot of time and potential errors in the future. With this system, I plan to create skill content every 2-3 months, and then update the skill with that data, giving me a nice worry-free window in case things are slow with certification. By automating the process, I can make all those above updates that are pretty far reaching into all of the infrastructure and code of the entire system, without touching the code myself. This really limits the vectors for failure and allows me to spend more of my time focusing on how to improve the game for customers.\n"", ""With all the moving parts, this was probably the most complicated and in depth skill I've built. It's the first one I've built using Subscriptions as an ISP. After spending alot of time on the design, and considering cutting alot of the scope, I'm proud that I completed everything I set out to do, and that I designed it in an efficient and scalable way that requires little maintenance. I'm excited to see how it performs now that its out there in the wild! \n"", ""Skill development is an amazing learning process, and I learned a ton with this project. While I had experience with some of these technologies before, I took steps to learn and include more technologies whenever I got the chance. For example, as part of this project I learned Typescript and built the entire skill using it. Being my first time using Typescript, it took at bit of studying up, but I think it paid off in the end and my skill is far more maintainable that it would have been without it. I also learned the importance of user testing. As part of the process, I recruited people that I knew to act as beta testers and play through the game for a few weeks before the release. This really allowed me to tweak the difficulty and gameplay and find a level where I think people will gain the most possible enjoyment. As I went through a couple iterations of this I found that each and every piece of feedback I acted on had an immediate effect on the next group of people I had try the game. It's definitely a process that I will continue doing on future projects. \n"", ""Now that I have everything set up and rolling, the next step is to iterate and improve the experience. Nothing is ever quite perfect on the first try, and that is why I set up a feedback system within the skill. Each day, users can rate the quality of the puzzle. This is stored into my database and I can use it to help me understand what is working and what isn't as I build more puzzles for the future.In addition, I want to iterate on the ISP. I want to find more ways to add value to subscribers with the potential for weekly challenge puzzles, or monthly competitions. I'd love to build out an A/B testing framework for this game so I can truly identify what is working and make smart analytical decisions about where to invest my time next. \n""]","['mysql', 'vuejs', 'node.js', 'lambda', 'amazon-dynamodb', 'jovo', 'amazon-alexa', 'javascript']","False","0","['gshenar']","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/882/494/datas/small.png","True","0"

That is why our primary focus is to connect them to nearby businesses that will offer discounts and benefits to verifiable evacuees. Businesses that are screened by and registered with Res-Q have several incentives. First, and most importantly, these companies can contribute to easing the financial and physical discomfort of victims. This is an opportunity for corporate benevolence and community involvement.

"Expirology","Managing expiration dates to reduce food waste","['There is $42.8 billion per year in food waste in the US. The current state of expiration labels in the world is overly complicated and results in massive amounts of food waste. We have all seen the combinations of ""Best by"", ""Use by"", and ""Sell by"" dates on the expiration labels of all sorts of products. Upon doing further research, we realized that these terms do not actually convey the expiration date of the product. For example, the term ""best buy"" is when the flavor is the best, not when the product expires. Over 33% of participants in a study conducted last year incorrectly assumed date labeling is federally regulated and another 26% were unsure. With Expirology, we aim to create a system for managing expiration dates based on the USDA database of refrigerator shelf life, rather than the confusing manufacturer labels.\n', 'Expirology is an iOS application that reduces food waste through an organizational system and greater freedom of information. By integrating a variety of federally regulated databases about expiration dates, the application can either use manual entry or a picture of a food and add it to your list of expiration dates. Expirology also sorts the expiration dates on the home page and has a comprehensive list to search through as well.\n', 'We decided to build this by dividing into different product development roles and teams. Vishal created a custom API that the iOS application could query data from using Python, Flask, and HTML. Rahul combined databases of information while cleansing and parsing through thousands of datapoints of expiration dates using Pandas in Python. Harish developed the front-end iOS application using SwiftUI which calling the API and displays the information for the user. Arjun worked in a variety of roles, from data scraping to flask development and front-end design within the team. James focused on using web scraping techniques through Python and BeautifulSoup to harvest and add data to our database.\n', ""Creating the API, gathering data, and handling dataflow in iOS were the most challenging aspects of this project. Although we knew Python beforehand, applying this knowledge and creating a RESTful API service using Flask as the backend was a new area for all of us and had many challenges as well. Further, although there are many databases available about food nutrition, there is not nearly as much about expiration dates since they are not federally regulated and depend on the manufacturer's discretion. Thus, we had to use web scraping to gather our own data as curated datasets were not available. The dataflow in iOS was also one of the biggest challenges we faced since SwiftUI is a relatively new platform and there are many differences in it, especially how the dataflow is handled.\n"", ""We're really proud of the iOS application and RESTful API we created for this project. Since all of us are freshmen, none of us had prior experience with technologies for creating custom APIs for our data as well as integrating this into an iOS application. Being able to create a platform based on a concept that we are all really passionate about makes us incredibly happy. We're happy that we learned new technologies and stepped out of our comfort zone, all while coding for good.\n"", 'We all learned about the value of communication within a team. Although each one of us had our own tasks to work on, we all needed each other and work together in order to actually develop the application. We used a lot of delegation and constant communication to get help from others and solve problems together. None of us had any particular front or back-end experience and we learned a lot about working outside what we know. In terms of technical skills, we all picked up a new application of languages we knew, whether it was Flask for Python or SwiftUI. These skills, along with the communication skills we learned, are truly invaluable.\n', ""At Expirology, we're passionate about having as much accessibility within our platform as possible. In the future, we would like to include multilingual support as well as text-to-speech features to improve the outreach of the app and how easy it is for a person of any age or background to use. We would also like to gather a wider database of expiration dates and include dates for products that are not refrigerated since currently we only handle those, simply due to time constraints. We would also like to add features such as text recognition from receipts that could be scanned since this would streamline the process for the user even more!\n""]","['swift', 'python', 'flask', 'ios', 'machine-learning', 'neural-networks', 'computer-vision', 'html']","False","0","['vishaldubey01', 'arjun94022', 'hyerra08', 'jameslim', 'rahulprakash012']","https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/881/021/datas/small.png","False","0"
